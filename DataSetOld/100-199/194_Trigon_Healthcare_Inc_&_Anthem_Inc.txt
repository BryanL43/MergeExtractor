MERGER PROPOSEDYOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT    

        Anthem, Inc. and Trigon Healthcare, Inc. have entered into a merger agreement and agreed to combine their companies. We believe that through
combining operating expertise and capturing new efficiencies, the merger of Anthem and Trigon will allow us to advance the long-term interests of both companies and to create more
shareholder value than could be achieved by either company individually. 

If the merger is completed, Trigon shareholders will have the right to receive, subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement, $30.00 in cash,
without interest, and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock for each share of Trigon Class A common stock they hold. Anthem shareholders will continue to own their existing Anthem shares and will
own approximately 72% of the combined company's common stock. The implied value of one share of Trigon Class A common stock on June 6, 2002, the last practicable trading day before the
distribution of this document, was $104.82, based on the closing price of Anthem common stock on that date plus $30.00. This value will fluctuate prior to completion of the
merger.

        We
cannot complete the merger unless, among other things, the shareholders of both our companies approve it. Each of us will hold a special meeting of our shareholders to vote on this
merger proposal. 
Your vote is important.
 The places, dates and times of the special meetings are as follows: 

For Anthem shareholders:

July 23, 2002

10:00 a.m., local time

Anthem, Inc.

120 Monument Circle

Indianapolis, Indiana 46204

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS  

To Anthem's Shareholders: 

        NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that a special meeting of Anthem shareholders will be held at Anthem's headquarters, 120 Monument Circle, Indianapolis, Indiana, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on
July 23, 2002. The purpose of the Anthem special meeting is to consider and to vote upon the following matters:


a
proposal to issue shares of Anthem common stock in connection with the merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
April 28, 2002, among Anthem, AI Sub Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem, and Trigon Healthcare, Inc.; and 

such
other business as may properly come before the Anthem special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 

        In
the merger, each share of Trigon Class A common stock will be converted into, subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement, the right to receive $30.00 in cash,
without interest, and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock. Your attention is directed to the joint proxy statement/prospectus
accompanying this notice for a discussion of the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is included as Appendix A to the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

        Anthem has fixed the close of business on June 6, 2002 as the record date for the Anthem special meeting, and only Anthem shareholders of record at such time will be entitled to receive
notice of and to vote at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. In order to approve the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger, the total number of votes cast at the
Anthem special meeting must represent over 50% of all Anthem common stock entitled to vote, and a majority of the shares voting at the Anthem special meeting must vote in favor of the issuance. 

Therefore, your vote is very
important.
 A complete list of Anthem shareholders entitled to vote at the Anthem special meeting will be made available for
inspection by any Anthem shareholder for five business days prior to the Anthem special meeting at the principal executive offices of Anthem and at the time and place of the Anthem special meeting.

        All
Anthem shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Anthem special meeting are cordially invited to attend the Anthem special meeting in person. 

However, to ensure your representation at the special meeting, please
submit your proxy, either by mail, by telephone or through the Internet with voting
instructions.
 The submission of your proxy will not prevent you from voting in person, but it will help to secure a quorum and avoid added solicitation costs. Any holder of
Anthem common stock who is present at the Anthem special meeting may vote in person instead of by proxy, thereby canceling any previous proxy. In any event, a proxy may be revoked in writing at any
time before the vote is taken at the Anthem special meeting. 

The Anthem board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Anthem shareholders vote "FOR" the issuance of Anthem
common stock in the merger.

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER    

Q:
What do I need to do now?
A:
After
you have carefully read this entire document, please vote your shares of either Anthem common stock or Trigon Class A common stock. You may do this either by completing,
signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card or by submitting your proxy by telephone or through the Internet, as explained in this document. This will enable your shares to be represented and
voted at the Anthem special meeting or the Trigon special meeting. 
Q:
Why is my vote important?
A:
If
you do not return your proxy card, submit your proxy by telephone or through the Internet or vote in person at your special meeting, it will be more difficult for Anthem and Trigon
to obtain the necessary quorum to hold their special meetings. In addition, if you are an Anthem shareholder, your failure to vote will have the result of reducing the number of affirmative votes
required to approve the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger. If you are a Trigon shareholder, your failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the merger
agreement. 
Q:
If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker automatically vote my shares for me?
A:
No.
Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions from you. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares, following the directions your broker provides.
Please check the voting form used by your broker to see if it offers telephone or Internet voting. 
Q:
What if I fail to instruct my broker?
A:
If
you fail to instruct your broker to vote your shares and the broker submits an unvoted proxy, the resulting broker "non-vote" will be counted toward a quorum at the
respective special meeting, but it will otherwise have the consequences set forth above under "
Why is my vote important?"  
Q:
Can I attend the special
meeting and vote my shares in person?
A:
Yes.
Shareholders of record of both Anthem and Trigon are invited to attend their respective special meetings and can vote in person at their meetings. If a broker holds your shares,
then you are not the shareholder of record and you must ask your broker how you can vote in person at the special meeting. 
Q:
Can I change my vote?
A:
Yes.
If you have not voted through your broker, there are three ways you can change your proxy instructions after you have submitted your proxy card, or submitted your proxy
telephonically, or through the Internet. 


First,
you may send a written notice to the person to whom you submitted your proxy revoking your proxy. 

Second,
you may complete and submit a new proxy card or submit a new proxy by telephone or through the Internet. The latest proxy actually received by Anthem
or Trigon before the shareholders' meeting will be counted, and any earlier proxies will be revoked. 

Third,
you may attend the Anthem special meeting or the Trigon special meeting and vote in person. Any earlier proxy will thereby be revoked. However, simply
attending the meeting without voting will 
not
 revoke your proxy. 

If
you have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow directions you receive from your broker in order to change or revoke your vote. 

Q:
Should I send in my stock certificates now?
A:
No.
You should not send in your stock certificates at this time. Trigon shareholders will need to exchange their Trigon stock certificates for cash and Anthem stock certificates after
we complete the merger. We will send you instructions for exchanging Trigon stock certificates at that time. Anthem shareholders do not need to exchange their stock certificates as a result of the
merger. 
Q:
Whom should I call with questions?
A:
Anthem
and Trigon shareholders with any questions about the merger and related transactions should call Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. toll-free at 1-866-811-4117. 

SUMMARY

The Companies (page 35)  

Anthem, Inc.  

Monument Circle

Indianapolis, Indiana 46204

(317) 488-6000 

        Anthem
is one of the nation's largest health benefits companies, serving approximately eight million members, primarily in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine,
Colorado and Nevada. Anthem holds the leading market position in seven of these eight states and owns the exclusive right to market its products and services using the Blue
Cross
[nc_cad,176]
 Blue Shield
[nc_cad,176]
, or BCBS, names and marks in all eight states under license agreements with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, or BCBSA, an
association of independent BCBS plans. Anthem seeks to be a leader in the health benefits industry by offering a broad selection of flexible and competitively priced health benefits products. 

Trigon Healthcare, Inc.  

Staples Mill Road

Richmond, Virginia 23230

(804) 354-7000 

        Trigon
is Virginia's largest health benefits company, providing a broad range of health, wellness and healthcare financing programs and services to more than two million members.
Trigon offers indemnity, preferred provider organization and health maintenance organization products as well as health management services such as disease management and high-risk
maternity programs. Trigon owns the exclusive right to market its products and services using the BCBS names and marks in the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding a small portion of northern Virginia
consisting of suburbs adjacent to Washington, D.C. 

AI Sub Acquisition Corp.  

        AI Sub Acquisition Corp. is an Indiana corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem. AI Sub Acquisition Corp. was formed exclusively for the purpose
of completing the merger. 

The Merger (page 39)  

        We are proposing a merger of Trigon with and into AI Sub Acquisition Corp., with AI Sub Acquisition Corp. as the surviving corporation in the merger. After the
merger is completed, the surviving corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem and will be named "Anthem Southeast, Inc." 

Merger Consideration (page 39)  

        As a result of the merger, each Trigon shareholder will have the right to receive, subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement, $30.00 in cash,
without interest, and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock for each share of Trigon Class A common stock held. Upon completion of the merger, we expect that Anthem shareholders will own
approximately 72% of the combined company and Trigon shareholders will own approximately 28% of the combined company. Anthem will not issue any

fractional shares. Trigon shareholders will instead receive an amount in cash equal to the value of any fractional shares that would have been issued, which value will be based on the closing price of
Anthem common stock on the trading day on which the merger is completed.

For example: if you hold 100 shares of Trigon Class A common stock you will receive $3,000 plus 106 shares of Anthem common stock. In addition, you will receive a cash
payment in lieu of the 0.2  

 shares of Anthem common stock that you would have otherwise received.

        We
have also agreed that if, at the time we would otherwise complete the merger, the market price of a share of Anthem common stock is less than $55.00 and has underperformed a weighted
average index of the market prices of shares of common stock of the health benefits companies set forth in the merger agreement by 15% or more since April 26, 2002, Trigon may terminate the
merger agreement. However, if Trigon elects to terminate the merger agreement under such circumstances, Anthem will have the right, but not the obligation, to prevent the merger agreement from being
terminated by either increasing the number of shares of Anthem common stock to be issued for each share of Trigon Class A common stock or increasing the amount of cash to be paid for each share
of Trigon Class A common stock, or a combination of both, in order to satisfy the minimum price criteria contained in the merger agreement. Anthem will not be able to increase the amount of
cash to be paid for each share of Trigon Class A common stock unless after such increase, the status of the merger as a "reorganization" under the Internal Revenue Code is preserved. 

Share Information and Comparative Market Prices (page 66 and page 177)

        Anthem common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ATH." Trigon Class A common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "TGH." The following table sets forth the closing sale prices of Anthem common stock and Trigon Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on
April 26, 2002, the last trading day before we announced the merger, and on June 6, 2002, the last practicable trading day before the distribution of this document. This table also shows the
implied value of one share of Trigon Class A common stock, which we calculated by multiplying the closing price of Anthem common stock on those dates by 1.062 and adding $30.00.

obtain current market quotations for Anthem common stock and Trigon Class A common stock. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to Trigon Shareholders (page 94)  

        The receipt of Anthem common stock by Trigon shareholders in exchange for their Trigon Class A common stock in the merger will generally be
tax-free. Trigon shareholders will generally recognize gain with respect to the cash they receive in the merger. 

Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to Trigon shareholders will depend on each shareholder's particular tax situation. Trigon
shareholders should consult their tax advisors to fully understand the tax consequences of the merger to them.

Reasons for the Merger (page 44 and page 47)  

        Our companies are proposing to merge because, among other things, we believe that: 


the
merger will provide Anthem with an excellent opportunity to expand its services to a new region as well as to capitalize upon Anthem's and Trigon's
business models;


both
companies have a common strategic focus on delivering the highest value to customers and, working together, we expect to expand future opportunities and
capture new efficiencies; and


the
merger will strengthen the combined company's position as a competitor in the health benefits industry, which is rapidly changing, consolidating and
growing more competitive. 

Recommendations to Shareholders (page 44 and page 47)  

        The Anthem board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Anthem's shareholders vote
"
FOR
" the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger. 

        The
Trigon board of directors has unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of Trigon and its shareholders and unanimously recommends that Trigon shareholders vote "
FOR
" approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. 

Opinion of Anthem's Financial Advisor (page 50)  

        Goldman, Sachs & Co. delivered its written opinion to Anthem's board of directors to the effect that, as of April 28, 2002, and based upon and subject to
the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $30.00 in cash and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock to be paid for each outstanding share of Trigon Class A common stock is fair, from a
financial point of view, to Anthem. 

        The
full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated April 28, 2002, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the
review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Appendix C to this document. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of Anthem's board of
directors in connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any Anthem shareholder should vote with respect to the issuance of Anthem
common stock in the merger. Anthem's shareholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. 

Opinion of Trigon's Financial Advisor (page 59)  

        Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. has delivered its written opinion to Trigon's board of directors to the effect that, as of April 27, 2002, and based upon and
subject to the considerations set forth therein, the $30.00 in cash, without interest, and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock to be paid for each share of Trigon Class A common stock is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        The written opinion of Bear Stearns, dated April 27, 2002, is attached as Appendix D to this document. The opinion sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Bear Stearns in providing its opinion. The written opinion of Bear Stearns is directed to Trigon's board of directors and addresses
only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the per share merger consideration to be paid by Anthem
pursuant to the merger agreement. The written opinion of Bear Stearns does not address any other aspect of the transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to Trigon's shareholders as to how
to vote at Trigon's shareholder meeting. If you are a Trigon shareholder, you are urged to carefully read the entire opinion in Appendix D.

Neither Anthem nor Trigon Shareholders have Dissenters' Rights (page 67)

        Anthem is incorporated in Indiana; Trigon is incorporated in Virginia. Under Indiana law, Anthem shareholders do not have any right to a court determination of
the fair value of their shares of Anthem common stock in connection with the merger. Similarly, under Virginia law, Trigon shareholders do not have any right to a court determination of the fair value
of their shares of Class A common stock in connection with the merger. 

The Merger Agreement (page 73)  

        The merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to this document. We urge you to read the entire document because it is the legal document governing the
merger. 

Conditions that Must be Satisfied or Waived for the Merger to Occur (page 77)

        As more fully described in this document and the merger agreement, the completion of the merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied or waived,
including receipt of shareholder, regulatory and BCBSA approvals and tax opinions. 

        Although
we expect to complete the merger during the second half of 2002, we cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger
will be completed. 

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 83)

        We may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement before completing the merger, even after approval of the merger agreement by Trigon shareholders and
approval of the issuance of Anthem common stock by Anthem shareholders. Each of us may also terminate the merger agreement if Anthem's shareholders do not approve the issuance of Anthem common stock
in the merger or if a final injunction is issued against the merger. 

        Also,
either of us may decide to terminate the merger agreement, even after the requisite shareholder approvals have been received, if the merger has not been completed by
January 28, 2003 or, generally, if the closing conditions in the merger agreement, such as obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals, have become incapable of satisfaction or the other party
has materially breached the merger agreement and the breach has not been cured or is incapable of being cured. 

        In addition, Anthem may terminate the merger agreement under the circumstances described in the merger agreement if Trigon's board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies its
recommendation of the merger in a manner adverse to Anthem or approves or recommends a business combination transaction with a person other than Anthem or if Trigon's shareholders do not approve the
merger agreement. Additionally, subject to Anthem's right to increase the merger consideration to prevent the merger agreement from being terminated, Trigon may terminate the merger agreement if, at
the time the parties would otherwise complete the merger, the market price of a share of Anthem common stock, as determined as set forth in the merger agreement, is less than $55.00 and has
underperformed a weighted average index of the market prices of shares of common stock of the health benefits companies set forth in the merger agreement by 15% or more since April 26, 2002.

Termination Fees (page 86)  

        We have agreed that, under specific circumstances described in the merger agreement, Trigon will be obligated to pay Anthem a termination fee of up to
$189.2 million. These circumstances generally
include a third party proposing a business combination transaction with Trigon and, prior to the withdrawal of such proposal:


Trigon's
board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation of the merger in a manner adverse to Anthem or approves or recommends the
business combination transaction with the third party;


Trigon
shareholders do not approve the merger agreement; or


Trigon
materially breaches its agreement to, among other things, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain its shareholders' approval of the
merger agreement, not solicit, encourage or facilitate a business combination with a third party or negotiate with or provide confidential information to third parties in connection with such a
business combination transaction. 

        In
addition, generally, in order for the termination fee to be payable, Trigon must sign an agreement regarding, or complete, a business combination transaction with a third party within
12 months after termination of the merger agreement; however, if Anthem terminates the merger agreement by the end of the first business day following notice that Trigon's board of directors
has withdrawn, amended or modified 

its recommendation of the merger or approved or recommended a business combination transaction with a third party and such proposed transaction is still pending at the time of such termination, half
of the termination feeapproximately $94.6 millionwill be payable in cash within one business day of that termination. The other half will be payable only if and when a
business combination transaction with a third party is actually signed or completed within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement.

Trigon Granted a Stock Option to Anthem (page 89)  

        To induce Anthem to enter into the merger agreement, Trigon granted Anthem an option to purchase up to an aggregate of 19.9% of the shares of Trigon
Class A common stock at a price per share of $84.25. Anthem cannot exercise this option, or require Trigon to repurchase this option or any shares purchased under it, unless the merger
agreement is terminated and the full termination fee of approximately $189.2 million (or the remaining $94.6 million portion of such fee) due under the merger agreement is payable.
Additionally, Anthem may not exercise the option for 5% or more of the outstanding shares of Trigon Class A common stock without receiving BCBSA approval. 

        We
do not know of any event that has occurred as of the date of this document that would allow Anthem to exercise this option. The aggregate value of the termination fees that could
become due
under the merger agreement and the profit realizable under the option are capped at approximately $189.2 million. 

        The
option could have the effect of discouraging other companies from trying to acquire Trigon until the merger is completed. 

        The
Trigon stock option agreement is attached to this document as Appendix B. 

Treatment of Trigon Stock Options and Restricted Stock (page 87)  

        As a general matter, each outstanding Trigon stock option will become fully vested and exercisable upon approval of the merger agreement by Trigon shareholders,
and in the merger each then-outstanding option will be converted into vested options to purchase Anthem common stock.

        The
number of shares of Anthem common stock underlying the new Anthem option will equal the number of shares of Trigon Class A common stock for which the corresponding Trigon
option was exercisable, multiplied by the option exchange ratio. The per share exercise price of each new Anthem option will equal the exercise price of the corresponding Trigon option divided by the
option exchange ratio. The option exchange ratio is equal to the sum of 1.062 plus a fraction, the numerator of which is $30.00 and the denominator of which is the closing trading price of Anthem
common stock on the business day prior to the completion of the merger. All shares of Trigon restricted Class A common stock will also vest upon approval of the merger agreement by Trigon
shareholders and will be treated in the merger like other shares of Trigon Class A common stock. 

Trigon's Directors and Executive Officers Have Financial Interests in the Merger (page 68)  

        Trigon's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger as individuals in addition to, and that may be different from, their interests as Trigon
shareholders. Each of the Anthem board of directors and the Trigon board of directors was aware of these interests of Trigon directors and executive officers and considered them in its decision to
respectively approve or adopt the merger agreement. 

        These
interests include: 


employment,
executive severance and noncompetition agreements that Anthem and Trigon entered into with principal executive officers of Trigon;


cash
payments and other benefits that may be due to other Trigon executive officers under existing executive continuity agreements in the event of a
termination of employment following the merger;


acceleration
and vesting of options and restricted stock upon approval of the 

merger
agreement by Trigon shareholders, although some executive officers have agreed to waive vesting of their stock options until completion of the merger; and 


the
right to continued indemnification and insurance coverage by the surviving corporation for events occurring prior to or at the time of the merger. 

        In
addition, three members of Trigon's board of directors will become members of Anthem's board of directors upon completion of the merger, and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of Trigon will become President of Anthem's Southeast Region, which will be headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. 

Regulatory and Other Approvals We Must Obtain for the Merger (page 37)  

        The Virginia State Corporation Commission must approve the change of control of Trigon. To accomplish this, Anthem and Trigon filed a Form A
"Application for Approval of Acquisition of Control of or Merger with a Domestic Insurer or Health Maintenance Organization" on May 31, 2002. The Virginia State Corporation Commission has
scheduled a public hearing on the Form A application to begin July 10, 2002.

        Additionally,
the BCBSA must approve the transfer to Anthem of Trigon's license to use the BCBS names and marks in Trigon's geographical territory. Anthem and Trigon have submitted a
joint application requesting that, in connection with completion of the merger, the BCBSA grant to Anthem the license for the Trigon territory. 

        Furthermore, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, provide that the merger may not be completed
until premerger notification filings have been made to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, and the specified waiting period thereunder has
expired or is terminated. Even after the waiting period expires or is terminated, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission will have the authority to challenge the merger on antitrust
grounds before or after the merger is completed. Each of Anthem and Trigon filed a notification and report form for the merger with the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department on
May 31, 2002.

        Although
we do not know of any reason why we cannot obtain these approvals in a timely manner, we cannot be certain when or if we will obtain them, or what conditions may be imposed by
any governmental or other regulatory or licensing authority or licensing party as a condition to granting its approval. 

The Rights of Trigon Shareholders will be Governed by Different Laws and New Governing Documents After the Merger (page 159)  

        Anthem is incorporated in Indiana; Trigon is incorporated in Virginia. Indiana and Virginia law differ, as do the rights of shareholders under the organizational
documents of Anthem and Trigon. Accordingly, the rights of Trigon shareholders may change materially as a result of the completion of the merger and the Trigon shareholders becoming Anthem
shareholders. 

Listing of Anthem Common Stock (page 66)

        The shares of Anthem common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ATH." 

Anthem Special Meeting (page 27)  

        Meeting.
    The Anthem special meeting will be held on July 23, 2002, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the headquarters of
Anthem, 120 Monument Circle, Indianapolis, Indiana. At the Anthem special meeting, Anthem shareholders will be asked:

1.
To
approve the issuance of shares of Anthem common stock in the merger; and

2.
To
act on such other matters as may be properly brought before the Anthem special meeting. 

        Record Date.
    Anthem shareholders may cast one vote at the Anthem special meeting for 

each share of Anthem common stock that they owned at the close of business on June 6, 2002. On that date, there were 102,887,815 shares of Anthem common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.

        Required Vote.
    To approve the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger, the total number of votes cast at the Anthem
special meeting must represent over 50% of all Anthem common stock entitled to vote, and a majority of the shares voting at the Anthem special meeting must vote in favor of the issuance. Accordingly,
an Anthem shareholder's failure to vote, a broker non-vote or an abstention will not constitute a vote for or against the approval of the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger, but
will reduce the aggregate number of shares voting at the Anthem special meeting and the number of shares of Anthem common stock required to approve the issuance of shares of Anthem common stock in the
merger. 

        As of the Anthem record date, directors and executive officers of Anthem and their affiliates beneficially owned or had the right to vote 125,574 shares of Anthem common stock, or less
than 1% of the outstanding Anthem common stock entitled to be voted at the special meeting. At that date, directors and executive officers of Trigon and their affiliates, including Trigon,
beneficially owned or had the right to vote 9,000 shares of Anthem common stock entitled to be voted at the meeting, or less than 1% of the outstanding Anthem common stock. To Anthem's knowledge,
directors and executive officers of Anthem and their affiliates intend to vote their Anthem common stock in favor of the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger.

Trigon Special Meeting (page 31)  

        Meeting.
    The Trigon special meeting will be held on July 23, 2002, at 11:00 a.m., local time, at the
headquarters of Trigon, 2015 Staples Mill Road, Richmond, Virginia. At the Trigon special meeting, Trigon shareholders will be asked:

1.
To
approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger; and

2.
To
act on such other matters as may be properly brought before the Trigon special meeting. 

        Record Date.
    Trigon shareholders may cast one vote at the Trigon special meeting for each share of Trigon Class A
common stock they owned at the close of business on June 6, 2002. On that date, there were 36,282,335 shares of Trigon Class A common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.

        Required Vote.
    To approve the merger agreement, the holders of more than 66

/

% of the outstanding shares of
Trigon Class A common stock entitled to be voted must vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement. Accordingly, a Trigon shareholder's failure to vote, a broker non-vote
or an abstention will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the merger agreement. 

        As of the Trigon record date, directors and executive officers of Trigon and their affiliates beneficially owned or had the right to vote 1,347,085 shares of Trigon Class A common
stock, or approximately 3.7% of the outstanding Trigon Class A common stock entitled to be voted at the special meeting. On that date, directors and executive officers of Anthem and their
affiliates, including Anthem, beneficially owned or had the right to vote 100 shares of Trigon Class A common stock entitled to be voted at the meeting, or less than 1% of the
outstanding Trigon Class A common stock. To Trigon's knowledge, directors and executive officers of Trigon and their affiliates intend to vote their Class A common stock in favor of the
approval of the merger agreement.

SELECTED CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF ANTHEM    

        The following table summarizes financial information for Anthem. Anthem prepared this information using its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 and its consolidated financial statements for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2001, which have
been audited by Ernst & Young LLP. You should read this information with Anthem's unaudited and audited consolidated financial statements and notes, Anthem management's discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations and unaudited pro forma combined financial information. See "ANTHEM MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAudited
Consolidated Financial Statements" on page F-34, "ANTHEM MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUnaudited Consolidated Financial Statements" on page F-65, "ANTHEM
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTSManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on page F-2, and "UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION" on page 178. In Anthem's opinion, the selected financial data for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 include all adjustments, consisting of
only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of that data. The selected consolidated financial data do not necessarily indicate the results to be expected in the future.

October 27, 1999, November 16, 1999 and June 5, 2000.

The
1999 operating gain includes a non-recurring charge of $41.9 million related to the settlement agreement with the Office of Inspector General, or OIG.
Net income for 1999 includes contributions totaling $114.1 million ($71.8 million, net of tax) to non-profit foundations in the states of Kentucky, Ohio and Connecticut to
settle charitable asset claims.

There
were no shares or dilutive securities outstanding prior to November 2, 2001 (date of demutualization and initial public offering). Accordingly, amounts prior to
2002 represent pro forma earnings per share. For comparative pro forma earnings per share presentation, the weighted average shares outstanding and the effect of dilutive securities for the period
from November 2, 2001 to December 31, 2001 was used to calculate pro forma earnings per share for all periods prior to 2002.

Operating
gain (loss) consists of operating revenue less benefit and administrative expenses. The benefit expense ratio represents benefit expense as a percentage of premium
revenue. The administrative expense ratio represents administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenue and has also been presented as a percentage of operating revenue and premium
equivalents. Operating margin represents operating gain (loss) as a percentage of operating revenue.

Operating
revenue and premium equivalents is a measure of the volume of business serviced by Anthem that is commonly used in the health benefits industry to allow for a
comparison of operating efficiency among companies. It is calculated by adding to premiums, administrative fees and other revenue the amount of claims attributable to non-Medicare,
self-funded health business where Anthem provides a complete array of customer service, claims administration and billing and enrollment services. The self-funded claims
included for the three months ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 were $1,044.6 and $896.7, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $3,937.1,
$3,256.6, $2,611.0, $2,597.7 and $2,159.3, respectively.

Excludes
TRICARE members of 419,000 at March 31, 2001 and 128,000, 129,000 and 153,000 at December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The TRICARE
operations were sold on May 31, 2001.

SELECTED CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF TRIGON    

        The following table summarizes financial information for Trigon. Trigon prepared this information using its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 and its consolidated financial statements for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2001, which have
been audited by KPMG LLP. You should read this information in conjunction with Trigon's unaudited and audited consolidated financial statements and notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Trigon's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 and Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, each of which are incorporated herein by reference. See "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" on page 186. In Trigon's
opinion, the selected financial data for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation of that data. The selected consolidated financial data do not necessarily indicate the results to be expected in the future.

(See footnotes on following page.)  

Reflects
net income per share for the period after February 5, 1997, the effective date of the demutualization and initial public offering (IPO). For 1997, net
income after demutualization and IPO was $79 million.

Pro
forma per share data for 1997 gives effect to the demutualization and IPO as if they had taken place on January 1, 1997 using the assumptions in Trigon's pro
forma presentation in its Form S-1 filed in connection with its IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1997.

The
amounts reported for 2001 and 2000 include the current and noncurrent portions of the commercial paper liability while the amounts reported for 1997 to 1999 represent
the noncurrent liability for a revolving credit facility repaid during 2000 with the issuance of the commercial paper. (See note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Trigon's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001.)

The
commercial medical cost ratio is calculated as a percentage of commercial premiums, which relate to Trigon's health benefits business other than Federal Employee
Program business and self-funded business. The selling, general and administrative expense ratio is calculated as a percentage of total revenues excluding amounts attributable to claims under
self-funded arrangements, investment income and net realized gains (losses).

Operating
income is calculated as the sum of premium and fee revenues and other revenues less the sum of medical and other benefit costs and selling, general and
administrative expenses. It differs from income before income taxes and minority interest because it excludes both income and net realized gains or losses from investment securities and interest
expense on debt. Operating income is intended to be used as a measure of operating performance of Trigon's health care business and does not capture Trigon's performance of its investment portfolio
and the interest incurred on debt. The operating margin ratio is calculated by dividing operating income by the sum of premium and fee revenues and other revenues. Trigon's definition of operating
income and the resulting operating margin ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be construed as a substitute for, or a better indicator
of, pretax profitability than income before income taxes and minority interest, which is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP.

Operating
income and the selected ratios for 1999 include the pretax charge of $79.9 million related to a subsidiary's exit of the health insurance market. (See
note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Trigon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Excluding this item, operating
income and the selected ratios for 1999 would have been: operating income, $44.6 million; commercial medical cost ratio, 81.4%; selling, general and administrative expense ratio, 13.2%; and
operating margin ratio, 2.0%.

Net
income per share excluding net realized gains and losses is defined as net income excluding the after-tax impact of net realized gains and losses on
investment securities divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Pro forma net income per share excluding net realized gains is calculated as pro forma net income per share excluding the pro
forma after-tax amounts for net realized gains divided by pro forma weighted average shares outstanding. Investors use these calculations as a measure of profitability excluding the
variability of net realized gains and losses on investment securities. Trigon's definition of this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies and should not be construed as a substitute for, or a better indicator of, company performance than net income per share, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

The
1999 amount includes the after-tax charge of $51.9 million, or a loss of $1.25 per common diluted share, related to a subsidiary's exit of the
health insurance market. Excluding this charge, diluted net income per share excluding realized losses for 1999 would have been $2.09. The 2000 amount includes the favorable tax benefit of
$2.7 million, or $0.07 per common diluted share, realized on the sale of a subsidiary. Excluding this tax benefit, net income per share excluding realized losses for 2000 would have been $3.28.
(See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Trigon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001.) 

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION    

        The following selected unaudited pro forma combined financial information combines historical amounts of Anthem and Trigon, adjusted to reclassify Trigon's
information to Anthem's presentation format and to reflect the effects of the merger. The table sets forth the information as if the merger had become effective on March 31, 2002, with respect
to balance sheet data, and at the beginning of the periods presented, with respect to income statement data. The pro forma data in the tables assume that the merger is accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. See "ACCOUNTING TREATMENT" on page 93. The selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited
pro forma combined financial statements and the related notes included herein and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Trigon, which are incorporated herein by
reference, and of Anthem, which are included herein. See "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" on page 186, "UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION" on page 178, "ANTHEM

Shares
of Trigon Class A common stock outstanding were converted at a rate of 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock for each share of Trigon Class A common
stock. In addition, it was assumed that of the 3,516,612 options for Trigon Class A common stock outstanding, options for 2,750,533 shares were exercised prior to the completion of the merger
and that Trigon used the proceeds to acquire and retire 1,129,242 shares of Class A common stock. The net new shares resulting from such exercise, totaling 1,621,291, were converted at a rate
of 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock for each share of Trigon Class A common stock, for a total of 1,721,811 shares of Anthem common stock. It has also been assumed that options for the
remaining 766,079 

shares
of Trigon Class A common stock were converted into Anthem stock options at a rate of 1.486 Anthem shares for each Trigon share, the exchange ratio resulting from an assumed value of
Anthem common stock of $70.70. 

The
per equivalent Trigon share data was calculated by multiplying the pro forma combined per share data by 1.062, so that the pro forma combined per share data amounts
are equated to the respective values for one share of Trigon Class A common stock.

We
have not presented Anthem pro forma combined or per equivalent Trigon share diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2001. Such amounts
would not be meaningful as no stock or dilutive securities existed for the majority of the year and a relevant market price for the entire year does not exist. There were no dilutive securities
outstanding prior to November 2, 2001, the effective date of the demutualization of Anthem Insurance, a subsidiary of Anthem, and Anthem's initial public offering. Historical and pro forma
basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2001 were calculated using the weighted average shares outstanding for the period from November 2, 2001 to December 31,
2001. 

RISK FACTORS    

        In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, you should consider the following risk factors in determining how to
vote at the special meetings of Anthem and Trigon. 

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER  

Anthem may experience difficulties in integrating Trigon's business with the existing business of Anthem, which could cause Anthem to lose many of the anticipated potential
benefits of the merger.  


We
have entered into the merger agreement because we believe that the merger will be beneficial to the combined companies. Achieving the anticipated benefits
of the merger will depend in part upon whether our two companies integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner. In particular, the successful combination of Anthem and Trigon will
depend on the integration of our respective businesses. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully. The necessity of coordinating geographically separated
organizations and addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of certain operations following the
merger will require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management's attention from the day-to-day business of the combined
companies. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt the business of the combined companies. Any inability of our management to integrate successfully the
operations of our two companies could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of Anthem. 

We must obtain several governmental and other consents to complete the merger, which, if delayed, not granted, or granted with unacceptable conditions, may jeopardize or
postpone completion of the merger, result in additional expenditures of money and resources or reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger.  


We
must obtain certain approvals and consents in a timely manner from federal and state agencies and the BCBSA prior to completion of the merger. If we do
not receive these approvals, or do not receive them on terms that satisfy the merger agreement, then we will not be obligated to complete the merger. The governmental agencies from which we will seek
these approvals have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. As a condition to approval of the merger, agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs that could negatively
affect the way the combined companies conduct business. These requirements, limitations or costs could jeopardize or delay completion of the merger. If we agree to any material requirements,
limitations or costs in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the merger, these requirements, limitations or additional costs could adversely affect Anthem's ability to integrate the
operations of Trigon with those of Anthem or reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger. This could result in a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial
condition of Anthem. 

Anthem will incur additional indebtedness to pay a portion of the merger consideration to Trigon's shareholders and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Anthem will
not be able to repay its indebtedness except through dividends from its subsidiaries, some of which are restricted in their ability under applicable insurance law to pay such dividends. Such
indebtedness could also adversely affect its ability to pursue desirable business opportunities.


Anthem
currently intends to incur up to $1.0 billion in long-term debt to finance a portion of the cash payments to be made to Trigon's
shareholders in the merger and may incur additional

indebtedness
in the future for other corporate purposes. As a holding company, Anthem has no operations and is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries for cash to fund its debt service and other
corporate needs. State insurance laws restrict the ability of Anthem's regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Anthem's indebtedness could also limit its ability to pursue desirable business
opportunities, and may affect its ability to maintain an investment grade rating for its indebtedness.

Anthem's bridge loan agreement contains conditions that may not be satisfied, in which case it would need to arrange for alternative sources of financing.


Anthem
will have cash requirements of approximately $1.2 billion for the merger, including both the cash portion of the purchase price and transaction
costs. Anthem has entered into a bridge loan agreement under which it may borrow up to $1.2 billion. The bridge loan agreement contains various conditions to Anthem's ability to borrow under
the bridge loan, including conditions related to (1) the absence of any material adverse change since December 31, 2001 in the business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or
operations of Anthem or in Anthem's ability to repay the bridge loan, (2) the absence of any new litigation or legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on Anthem as described
in (1) above, (3) Anthem's failure to comply with the financial covenants and ratios set forth in the bridge loan agreement, and (4) the requirement that Anthem and its
unregulated subsidiaries (after giving effect to the merger) must have cash or cash equivalents on hand of at least $300 million at the time of the merger. Anthem cannot be certain that these
conditions will be satisfied and, because the merger agreement does not contain a financing condition, if they are not, Anthem would need to arrange for alternative sources of financing.

Trigon shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the shares of Anthem common stock that will be issued in the merger. In addition, Trigon has the right to terminate
the merger agreement if the market price of Anthem common stock decreases significantly, and significantly underperforms an agreed index of health benefit companies.  


Upon
completion of the merger, each share of Class A common stock of Trigon outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be converted into the
right to receive cash and shares of Anthem common stock. Because the exchange ratio is generally fixed at 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock for each share of Trigon Class A common stock, the
market value of the Anthem common stock issued in the merger will depend upon the market price of a share of Anthem common stock upon completion of the merger. This market value of Anthem common stock
will fluctuate prior to the completion of the merger and therefore may be different at the time the merger is completed than it was at the time the merger agreement was signed and at the time of the
shareholders' meetings. Accordingly, Trigon shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the Anthem common stock that they will receive upon completion of the merger, or the market value of
Anthem common stock at any time after the merger. 

In
the merger agreement, we have agreed that if, at the time we would otherwise complete the merger, the market price of a share of Anthem common stock is
less than $55.00 and has underperformed a weighted average index of the market prices of shares of common stock of the health benefits companies set forth in the merger agreement by 15% or more since
April 26, 2002, Trigon will have the
right to terminate the merger agreement. However, if Trigon elects to terminate the merger agreement under such circumstances, Anthem will have the right, but not the obligation, and provided the
status of the merger as a "reorganization" under the Internal Revenue Code is preserved, to prevent the merger agreement from being terminated by either increasing the number of shares of Anthem
common stock to be issued for each share of Trigon Class A common stock or increasing the amount of cash to be paid for each share of Trigon 

Class A
common stock, or a combination of both, in order to satisfy the minimum price criteria contained in the merger agreement. If the merger is completed under such circumstances, Anthem
will have elected to pay either more cash or issue more common stock, or a combination of both, in the merger, either of which could adversely affect Anthem's results of operations. 

RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS OF ANTHEM, TRIGON AND THE COMBINED COMPANY  

Changes in state and federal regulations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As holding companies, we are dependent on dividends
from our subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state regulations, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital.  


Our
insurance and health maintenance organization, or HMO, subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the insurance regulatory
authorities of each state in which they are licensed or authorized, as well as to regulation by federal and local agencies. We cannot assure you that future regulatory action by state insurance
authorities will not have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products or on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, because of Anthem's participation in government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and both Anthem's and Trigon's participation in Medicaid, changes in government regulations
or policy with respect to, among other things, reimbursement levels, could also adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations. 

State
legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. Congress is considering various forms of Patients' Bill of Rights legislation which,
if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Additionally, there recently have been legislative
attempts to limit ERISA's preemptive effect on state laws. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations. Other
proposed bills and regulations at state and federal levels may impact certain aspects of our business, including provider contracting, claims payments and processing
and confidentiality of health information. While we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become effective or, if enacted, what their terms will be, their enactment could increase
our costs, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business. Further, as we continue to implement our e-business initiatives, uncertainty
surrounding the regulatory authority and requirements in this area may make it difficult to ensure compliance. 

In
December 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services, known as HHS, promulgated certain regulations under the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, related to the privacy of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information. The new regulations require health plans,
clearinghouses and providers to: 


comply
with various requirements and restrictions related to the use, storage and disclosure of protected health information; 

adopt
rigorous internal procedures to protect protected health information; and 

enter
into specific written agreements with business associates to whom protected health information is disclosed. 

    The
regulations establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance. In addition, the regulations could expose us to additional liability for, among other
things, violations by our business associates. We must comply with the new regulations by April 14, 

2003. Although we have not quantified the costs required to comply with the regulations, we believe the costs could be material. 


We
are holding companies whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our licensed insurance company subsidiaries. As holding
companies, we depend on dividends from our licensed insurance company subsidiaries and their receipt of dividends from our other regulated subsidiaries. Among other restrictions, state insurance laws
may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Our ability to pay dividends in the future to our shareholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses
and debt service on our outstanding and future indebtedness, will depend upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. An inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in the future in an
amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital, or RBC, standards, imposed by their states of domicile. These laws are
based on the RBC Model Act adopted by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the departments of insurance and the
NAIC. Failure to maintain the minimum RBC standards could subject our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action, including state supervision or liquidation. Our insurance and HMO subsidiaries are
currently in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements imposed by their respective states of domicile. 

Our inability to contain health care costs, efficiently implement increases in premium rates, maintain adequate reserves for policy benefits, maintain our current provider
agreements or avoid a downgrade in our ratings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  


Our
profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting
criteria, utilization management, product design and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. The aging of the population and other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology
continue to contribute to rising health care costs. Government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement have also caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing
health care costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment and numerous other
factors affecting the cost of health care may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In
addition to the challenge of managing health care costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. Our customer contracts may be subject to renegotiation
as customers seek to contain their costs. Alternatively, our customers may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. Fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of programs such as
Medicare and Medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates for government-sponsored programs in which Anthem participates. A limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The
reserves we establish for health insurance policy benefits and other contractual rights and benefits are based upon assumptions concerning a number of
factors, including trends in health care costs, expenses, general economic conditions and other factors. Actual experience will likely differ from assumed experience, and to the extent the actual
claims experience is less favorable than estimated based on our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected. 


Our
profitability is dependent upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The failure to
maintain or to secure new cost-effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss in membership or higher medical costs. In addition, our inability to contract with providers,
or the inability of providers to provide adequate care, could adversely affect our business. 

Claims
paying ability and financial strength ratings by recognized rating organizations have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the
competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies. Rating organizations continue to review the financial performance and condition of insurers. Each of the rating agencies
reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. We believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to
our customers, since ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. If our ratings are downgraded or placed under surveillance or review, with possible
negative implications, the downgrade, surveillance or review could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our
financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not
be relied upon when making a decision on how to vote at the meetings. 

We face risks related to litigation.  


We
may be a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit
claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating
to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of our products and services. These could include: 


claims
relating to the denial of health care benefits; 

medical
malpractice actions; 

allegations
of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; 

provider
disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; 

disputes
related to self-funded business; 

disputes
over co-payment calculations; 

claims
related to the failure to disclose certain business practices; and 

claims
relating to customer audits and contract performance. 


A
number of class action lawsuits have been filed against Anthem and certain of Anthem's competitors in the managed care business. The suits are purported
class actions on behalf of certain of Anthem's managed care members and network providers for alleged breaches of various state and federal laws. While Anthem intends to defend these suits vigorously,
Anthem will incur expenses in the defense of these suits and cannot predict their outcome. 

Recent
court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial
non-economic, treble or punitive damages may be sought. We currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by
insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered
by insurance and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. 

A reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability. The health benefits industry is subject to
negative publicity, which can adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, we face significant competition from other health benefits companies.  


A
reduction in the number of enrollees in our health benefits programs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include: 


failure
to obtain new customers or retain existing customers; 

premium
increases and benefit changes; 

our
exit from a specific market; 

reductions
in workforce by existing customers; 

negative
publicity and news coverage; 

failure
to attain or maintain nationally-recognized accreditations; and 

general
economic downturn that results in business failures. 


The
health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry
practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by: 


adversely
affecting our ability to market our products and services; 

requiring
us to change our products and services; or 

increasing
the regulatory burdens under which we operate. 

    In
addition, as long as we use the BCBS names and marks in marketing our health benefits products and services, any negative publicity concerning the BCBSA or other BCBSA licensees may
adversely affect us and the sale of our health benefits products and services. 


As
a health benefits company, we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from
business consolidations, new strategic alliances, legislative reform, aggressive marketing practices by other health benefits organizations and market pressures brought about by an informed and
organized customer base, particularly among large employers. This environment has produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures on the profitability of health benefits companies.
Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources. In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which gives banks and other financial institutions the ability to affiliate
with insurance companies, could result in new competitors with significant financial resources entering our markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current
and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Regional concentrations of our business may subject us to economic downturns in those regions.  


Our
business operations include or consist of regional companies located in the Midwest, East and West (in the case of Anthem), and in the Southeast (in the
case of Trigon) with most of our revenues generated in the states of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Colorado and Nevada (in the case of Anthem) and in the Commonwealth of
Virginia (in the case of Trigon). Due to this concentration of business in a small number of states, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of an economic downturn in these states.
If economic conditions in these states deteriorate, we may experience a reduction in existing and 

new
business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Anthem has built a significant portion of its current business through mergers and acquisitions and expects to pursue acquisitions in the future. The following are some of the
risks associated with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:  


some
of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; 

Anthem
may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to it; 

Anthem
may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which
could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; 

acquisitions
could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards,
controls and procedures; 

Anthem
may finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our
shareholders; 

Anthem
may also incur additional debt related to future acquisitions; and 

Anthem
would be competing with other firms, many of which have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies. 

Our investment portfolios are subject to varying economic and market conditions, as well as regulation. As Medicare fiscal intermediaries, we are subject to complex
regulations. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be exposed to criminal sanctions and significant civil penalties. Moreover, we are using the BCBS names and marks as identifiers for
our products and services under licenses from the BCBSA. The termination of these license agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  


The
market value of our investments varies from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. For various reasons, we may sell certain of our
investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of the investments. In addition, in periods of declining interest rates, bond calls and mortgage loan prepayments generally increase,
resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at the then lower market rates. We cannot assure you that our investment portfolios will produce positive returns in future periods. Our regulated
subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as
below-investment-grade fixed income securities, mortgage loans, real estate and equity investments, which could generate higher returns on our investments. Failure to comply with these laws and
regulations might cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital,
and, in some instances, require the sale of those investments. 

Like
a number of other BCBS companies, Anthem serves as a fiscal intermediary for the Medicare program, which generally provides coverage for persons who are
65 or older and for persons with end-stage renal disease. Part A of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other
health care facilities. Part B of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by physicians, physical and occupational therapists and other professional providers. As a fiscal
intermediary, Anthem receives reimbursement for certain costs and expenditures, which is subject to adjustment upon audit by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, formerly
the Health 

Care
Financing Administration, or HCFA. The laws and regulations governing fiscal intermediaries for the Medicare program are complex, subject to interpretation and can expose a fiscal intermediary
to penalties for non-compliance. Fiscal intermediaries may be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties or other sanctions as a result of such audits or reviews. In the fourth quarter of
1999, one of Anthem's subsidiaries reached a settlement agreement with the federal government in the amount of $41.9 million to resolve an investigation into the Medicare fiscal intermediary
operations of a predecessor of the subsidiary. The period investigated was before Anthem acquired the subsidiary. While Anthem believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the
regulations governing fiscal intermediaries, there are ongoing reviews by the federal government of Anthem's activities under certain of Anthem's Medicare fiscal intermediary contracts. One of
Anthem's subsidiaries, AdminaStar Federal, Inc., has received several subpoenas from the OIG, Health and Human Services, and from the U.S. Department of Justice seeking documents and
information concerning its responsibilities as a Medicare Part B contractor in its Kentucky office, and requesting certain financial records from AdminaStar Federal, Inc. and from Anthem
related to Anthem's Medicare fiscal intermediary Part A and Part B operations. For additional information, see "BUSINESS OF ANTHEMAnthem's Other Contingencies" on
page 128. 


We
are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive use of the BCBS names and marks in our geographic territories. The
license agreements contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks, including: 


minimum
capital and liquidity requirements; 

enrollment
and customer service performance requirements; 

participation
in programs which provide portability of membership between plans; 

disclosures
to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions; 

disclosures
as to the structure of the BCBS system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; 

plan
governance requirements; 

a
requirement that at least 80% of a licensee's annual combined net revenue attributable to health benefits plans within its service area must be sold,
marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks; 

a
requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the
plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services; 

a
requirement that we guarantee the contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and 

a
requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary
which serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. 

        We
believe that we and our licensed affiliates are currently in compliance with these standards. 

        Upon
the occurrence of an event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the BCBS names and marks in one or more of our geographic
territories. Furthermore, the BCBSA would be free to issue a license to use the BCBS names and marks in these states to another entity. Events which could cause the termination of a license agreement
with the BCBSA include failure to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending 

financial insolvency, the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against a licensee seeking its dissolution. We believe that the BCBS names and marks are valuable
identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace. Accordingly, termination of the license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 

The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our operations in an Internet environment could adversely affect our business.  


Our
businesses depend significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. Our
information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information
processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. For example, HIPAA's administrative simplification provisions and the Department of Labor's claim
processing regulations may ultimately require significant changes to current systems. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or
facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties' failure to perform adequately. As a result of our merger and acquisition activities, we have
acquired additional systems. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate
redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Also,
like many of our competitors in the health benefits industry, our vision for the future includes becoming a premier e-business organization
by modernizing interactions with customers, brokers, agents, employees and other stakeholders through web-enabling technology and redesigning internal operations. We are developing our
e-business strategy with the goal of becoming widely regarded as an e-business leader in the health benefits industry. The strategy includes not only sales and distribution of
health benefits products on the Internet, but also implementation of advanced self-service capabilities benefiting customers, agents, brokers, partners and employees. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to realize successfully our e-business vision or integrate e-business operations with our current method of operations. The failure to develop
successful e-business capabilities could result in competitive and cost disadvantages to us as compared to our competitors. 

Indiana law and Anthem's articles of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our current shareholders and Trigon's former
shareholders after completion of the merger might consider in their best interests.  


Indiana
law and Anthem's articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that Anthem's
shareholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent Anthem shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of Anthem's common stock offered
by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of Anthem's common stock if they are
viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. 

Under
the Indiana demutualization law, for a period of five years following November 2, 2001, the effective date of Anthem's demutualization, no
person may acquire beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of Anthem's common stock without the prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner and Anthem's board of
directors. This restriction does not apply to acquisitions made by Anthem or made pursuant to an employee benefit plan or 

employee
benefit trust sponsored by Anthem. The Indiana Insurance Commissioner has adopted rules under which passive institutional investors could purchase 5% or more but less than 10% of Anthem's
outstanding common stock with the prior approval of Anthem's board of directors and prior notice to the Indiana Insurance Commissioner.


Anthem's
articles of incorporation restrict the beneficial ownership of its capital stock in excess of specific ownership limits. The ownership limits
restrict beneficial ownership of Anthem's voting capital stock to less than 10% for institutional investors and less than 5% for noninstitutional investors, both as defined in Anthem's articles of
incorporation. Additionally, no person may beneficially own shares of Anthem common stock representing a 20% or more ownership interest in Anthem. These restrictions are intended to ensure Anthem's
compliance with the terms of its licenses with the BCBSA. By agreement between Anthem and the BCBSA, these ownership limits may be increased. Anthem's articles of incorporation prohibit ownership of
Anthem capital stock beyond these ownership limits without prior approval of a majority of Anthem's continuing directors (as defined in Anthem's articles of incorporation).


Certain
other provisions included in Anthem's articles of incorporation and bylaws may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or
prevent a takeover attempt that Anthem's shareholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, Anthem's articles of incorporation and bylaws: 


permit
Anthem's board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; 

divide
Anthem's board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; 

restrict
the maximum number of directors; 

limit
the ability of shareholders to remove directors; 

impose
restrictions on shareholders' ability to fill vacancies on Anthem's board of directors; 

prohibit
shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders; 

impose
advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; and 

impose
restrictions on shareholders' ability to amend Anthem's articles of incorporation and bylaws.

"expect," "plan," "believe," "predict," "potential," "intend" or similar expressions. Health benefits companies operate in a highly competitive, constantly changing environment that is significantly
influenced by aggressive marketing and pricing practices of competitors, regulatory oversight and organizations that have resulted from business combinations. The following is a summary of factors,
the results of which, either individually or in combination, if markedly different from our planning assumptions, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statements contained in this document: 


trends
in health care costs and utilization rates;


ability
to secure sufficient premium rate increases;


competitor
pricing below market trends of increasing costs;


increased
government regulation of health benefits and managed care;


significant
acquisitions or divestitures by major competitors;


introduction
and utilization of new prescription drugs and technology;


a
downgrade in our financial strength ratings;


litigation
targeted at health benefits companies;


ability
to contract with providers consistent with past practice;


general
economic downturns;


the
level of realization, if any, of expected cost savings and other synergies from the merger;


difficulties
related to the integration of the business of Anthem and Trigon may be greater than expected; and


revenues
following the merger may be lower than expected. 

        Because
such forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Anthem shareholders and Trigon shareholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this document or the date of any document
incorporated by reference.

their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, neither
Anthem nor Trigon undertakes any obligation to release publicly any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the

THE ANTHEM SPECIAL MEETING    

This section contains information from Anthem for Anthem shareholders about the special meeting of shareholders it has called to consider
and approve the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger.

        Together with this document, Anthem is also sending you a notice of the Anthem special meeting and a form of proxy that is solicited by Anthem's board of directors for use at the Anthem
special meeting to be held on July 23, 2002, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at Anthem's headquarters, 120 Monument Circle, Indianapolis, Indiana, and any adjournments or postponements of the
meeting.

Matters to Be Considered  

        The purpose of the Anthem special meeting is to consider and to vote on a proposal to issue shares of Anthem common stock in connection with the merger
contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 28, 2002 among Anthem, AI Sub Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem, and Trigon. 

        You
may be asked to vote upon other matters that may properly be submitted to a vote at the Anthem special meeting. You also may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn or postpone the
Anthem special meeting. Anthem could use any adjournment or postponement for the purpose of, among others, allowing additional time to solicit proxies. 

Proxies  

        Each copy of this document mailed to Anthem shareholders is accompanied by a form of proxy with voting instructions for submission by mail, telephone and through
the Internet. You should complete and return the proxy card accompanying this document or submit your proxy or voting instructions electronically by telephone or through the Internet in order to
ensure that your vote is counted at the Anthem special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, regardless of whether you plan to attend the special meeting. 

        Please
note that there are separate arrangements for using the telephone and the Internet depending on whether your shares are registered in Anthem's stock records in your name or in the
name of a brokerage firm, bank or other holder of record. Anthem shareholders should check their proxy card or voting instructions forwarded by their broker, bank or other holder of record to see
which options are available. 

        The
telephone and Internet procedures described below for submitting your proxy or voting instructions are designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to
have their shares voted and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Shareholders submitting proxies or voting instructions through the Internet should understand that there may
be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, that would be borne by the shareholder. 

        Anthem
holders of record may submit their proxies electronically:


by
telephone by calling the toll-free number 1-877-779-8683 and following the recorded instructions; or


through
the Internet by visiting a website established for that purpose at 
www.eproxyvote.com/ath
 and following the
instructions.

        Anthem
shareholders may revoke their proxies at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting by: 


submitting
written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Anthem prior to the voting of such proxy;


submitting
a properly executed proxy of a later date; or


voting
in person at the special meeting; however, simply 
attending
 the special meeting without voting will
not revoke an earlier proxy. 

        If
your shares are not held in street name, written notices of revocation and other communications regarding the revocation of your proxy should be addressed to: 

Anthem, Inc.

120 Monument Circle

Indianapolis, Indiana 46204

Attention: Nancy L. Purcell, Secretary 

as
early as possible to ensure that the notice of revocation reaches Anthem at the above address prior to the date of the special meeting. 

        If
your shares are held in street name, you should follow the instructions of your broker regarding revocation of proxies. 

        All
shares represented by valid proxies that Anthem receives through this solicitation, and that are not revoked, on a timely basis, will be voted in accordance with the instructions on
the proxy card or made by telephone or the Internet. If you make no specification on your proxy card as to how you want your shares to be voted before signing and returning it, your proxy will be
voted "
FOR
" the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger. The Anthem board of directors is currently unaware of any other matters that may be
presented for action at the special meeting. If other matters properly come before the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, Anthem intends that shares represented by properly
submitted proxies will be voted, or not voted, by and at the discretion of the persons named as proxies on the proxy card. However, proxies that indicate a vote against the issuance of shares of
Anthem common stock in the merger will not be voted in favor of adjourning or postponing the special meeting to solicit additional proxies. 

Anthem shareholders should NOT send stock certificates with their proxy cards. If the merger is completed, Anthem shareholders will not need to exchange their
current stock certificates.

Solicitation of Proxies  

        Anthem will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from you except as noted above with respect to costs that may be associated with electronic voting and
except that Anthem and Trigon have agreed to share the costs of filing, printing and mailing this document. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Anthem will request that banks, brokers and other
record holders send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of Anthem common stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. Anthem will reimburse the record holders for their
reasonable expenses in taking those actions. Anthem and Trigon have also made arrangements with Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist in soliciting proxies and have agreed to pay
Georgeson a base fee of $15,000, direct telephone solicitation and shareholder inquiries fees, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these services. If necessary, Anthem may also use several of
its regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from Anthem shareholders, either personally or by telephone, telegram, facsimile or letter.

Record Date  

        Anthem has fixed the close of business on June 6, 2002 as the record date for determining the Anthem shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote
at the Anthem special meeting. At that time, 102,887,815 shares of Anthem common stock were outstanding, held by approximately 186,000 holders of record.

Voting Rights and Vote Required  

        Under Anthem's bylaws, the presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of more than 25% of Anthem common stock entitled to vote is necessary
to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted solely for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Under the applicable New
York Stock Exchange rules, brokers or members who hold shares in street name for customers who are the beneficial owners of such shares are prohibited from giving a proxy to vote those shares with
respect to the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger without specific instructions from such customers. An unvoted proxy submitted by a broker is sometimes referred to as a "broker
non-vote."

        Notwithstanding the quorum requirement set forth in Anthem's bylaws, the rules of the New York Stock Exchange require that, in order to approve the issuance of Anthem common stock
in the merger, the total number of votes cast represent more than 50% of all Anthem common stock entitled to vote and that a majority of the shares voting at the Anthem special meeting vote in favor
of the issuance. You are entitled to one vote for each share of Anthem common stock you held as of the record date. However, Anthem's articles of incorporation provide that shareholders of record who
beneficially own in excess of (a) 10% for institutional investors, (b) 5% for non-institutional investors or (c) any higher percentage the BCBSA agrees to permit in
writing, are not entitled to any vote with respect to shares in excess of such limitations. A person or entity is deemed to beneficially own shares that are owned by an affiliate as well as by any
person acting in concert with such person or entity.

Because of the requirement that more than 50% of all outstanding Anthem common stock must be voted on the proposal to issue shares of Anthem common stock in the
merger, if you do not vote by proxy or in person, it will make it less likely that this requirement will be met. Additionally, a failure to vote by proxy or in person, although not constituting a vote
for or against the approval of the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger, will reduce the aggregate number of shares voting at the special meeting and will reduce the number of shares of
Anthem common stock required to approve the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger. The Anthem board of directors urges Anthem shareholders to complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy
card and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or to promptly submit their proxies by telephone or through the Internet.

        As
of the record date:


Directors
and executive officers of Anthem and their affiliates beneficially owned or had the right to vote 125,574 shares of Anthem common stock, or less
than 1% of the Anthem common stock outstanding on that date.


Directors
and executive officers of Trigon and their affiliates, including Trigon, beneficially owned 9,000 shares of Anthem common stock, or less than 1% of
the Anthem common stock outstanding on that date.


To
Anthem's knowledge, directors and executive officers of Anthem and their affiliates have indicated that they intend to vote their shares of Anthem common
stock in favor of the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger. 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors  

        The Anthem board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that you vote
"
FOR
" the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger. 

        See
"THE MERGERAnthem's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Anthem's Board of Directors" on page 44 for a more detailed discussion of the Anthem board of
directors' recommendation. 

Attending the Meeting  

        If you are a beneficial owner of Anthem common stock held by a broker, bank or other holder of record (
i.e
., in
"street name"), you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the special meeting. A recent brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker are examples of proof of ownership. If you want to
vote your shares of Anthem common stock held in street name in person at the meeting, you will have to get a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other holder of record who holds your
shares.

THE TRIGON SPECIAL MEETING

        If

However, proxies that indicate a vote against approval of the merger agreement will not be voted in favor of adjourning or postponing the special meeting to solicit additional proxies. 

 Trigon shareholders should NOT send stock certificates with their proxy cards.  

Solicitation of Proxies  

        Trigon will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from you except as noted above with respect to costs that may be associated with electronic voting and
except that Anthem and Trigon have agreed to share the costs of filing, printing and mailing this document. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Trigon will request that banks, brokers and other
record holders send proxies and proxy material to the

beneficial owners of Trigon Class A common stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. Trigon will reimburse the record holders for their reasonable expenses in taking those
actions. Trigon and Anthem have also made arrangements with Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist in soliciting proxies and have agreed to pay Georgeson a base fee of $15,000,
direct telephone solicitation and shareholder inquiries fees, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for these services. If necessary, Trigon may also use several of its regular employees, who will not
be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from Trigon shareholders, either personally or by telephone, telegram, facsimile or letter.

Record Date  

        Trigon has fixed the close of business on June 6, 2002 as the record date for determining the Trigon shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote
at the Trigon special meeting. At that time, 36,282,335 shares of Trigon common stock were outstanding, held by approximately 71,000 holders of record.

Voting Rights and Vote Required  

        The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Trigon common stock entitled to vote is necessary
to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted solely for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Under the applicable New
York Stock Exchange rules, brokers or members who hold shares in "street name" for customers who are the beneficial owners of such shares are prohibited from giving a proxy to vote those shares with
respect to approving the merger agreement without specific instructions from such customers. An unvoted proxy submitted by a broker is sometimes referred to as a "broker non-vote." 

        The
approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, requires the affirmative vote of more than 66

/

% of
the shares of Trigon Class A common stock outstanding as of the record date. You are entitled to one vote for each share of Trigon Class A common stock you held as of the record date. 

Because of the requirement that more than 66

/

% of all outstanding shares of Trigon Class A common stock entitled to vote to approve the
merger agreement, if you do not vote by proxy or in person, it will make it less likely that the merger agreement will be approved. Accordingly, the Trigon board of directors urges Trigon shareholders
to complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy card and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or to promptly submit their proxies by telephone or through the
Internet.

        As
of the record date:


Directors
and executive officers of Trigon and their affiliates beneficially owned or had the right to vote 1,347,085 shares of Trigon Class A common
stock, or approximately 3.7% of the Trigon Class A common stock outstanding on that date.


Directors
and executive officers of Anthem and their affiliates, including Anthem, beneficially owned 100 shares of Trigon Class A common stock, or
less than 1% of the Trigon Class A common stock outstanding on that date.


To
Trigon's knowledge, directors and executive officers of Trigon and their affiliates have indicated that they intend to vote their shares of Trigon
Class A common stock in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors  

        The Trigon board of directors has unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of Trigon and its shareholders and unanimously recommends that Trigon's shareholders vote "
FOR
" approval of the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, including the merger. 

        See
"THE MERGERTrigon's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Trigon's Board of Directors" on page 47 for a more detailed discussion of the Trigon board of directors'
recommendation. 

Attending the Meeting  

        If you are a beneficial owner of Trigon Class A common stock held by a broker, bank or other holder of record
(
i.e.
, in "street name"), you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the special meeting. A recent brokerage statement or letter from a bank or
broker are examples of proof of ownership. If you want to vote your shares of Trigon Class A common stock held in street name in person at the meeting, you will have to get a written proxy in
your name from the broker, bank or other holder of record who holds your shares. 

Participants in Trigon's Benefit Plans  

        If you are a participant in the Employee's 401(k) Thrift Plan of Trigon Insurance Company, or 401(k) Plan, or in the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP,
you will receive a proxy card with voting instructions with this joint proxy statement/prospectus indicating the number of shares of Trigon Class A common stock held by the trustee or custodian
for the relevant plan on your behalf. Neither Trigon nor the trustee or custodian can exercise discretion as to the voting of shares in these plans. However, if you own shares in either of the plans
and do not provide instructions, or if your instructions as to the voting of your shares are not received in a timely manner, your shares will be voted as follows:


with
respect to the 401(k) Plan, the trustee will vote your shares in the plan in the same proportion to the shares for which it has received timely
instructions from participants; and


with
respect to the ESPP, because this plan does not provide for the voting of shares as to which the custodian has not received timely instructions, and the
shares are held in a custodial account under the participant's name, failure to provide instructions will have the same effect as a vote against the merger. 

        Because the trustee or custodian for the relevant plan must process voting instructions from participants before the date of the special meeting, you are urged to deliver your
instructions well in advance of the special meeting so that the instructions are received no later than July 18, 2002.

        If you vote your plan shares and then wish to revoke your instructions, you should submit a notice of revocation to Trigon as soon as possible, as described under "Proxies"
above.

between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Trigon provides health benefits to federal employees in Virginia. Trigon also serves multi-state customers through the
BlueCard program, which links all BCBSA affiliated plans for claims submission and payment purposes. The BlueCard program has enabled Trigon to serve a growing share of
self-funded business outside Virginia through the coordination of service and claims functions across the BCBSA affiliated plans.

REGULATORY AND OTHER APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR THE MERGER    

        Under the merger agreement, each of Anthem and Trigon has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, tax ruling requests and other documents, to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, tax rulings and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any governmental entity in order to complete the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to take all actions reasonably necessary to satisfy the closing conditions contained in the merger agreement and to complete the merger. 

        Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Anthem is not obligated to agree to, among other things, any condition that would impose any obligation, restriction, limitation, qualification or
condition (including any limitation on its ownership or operation of all or any portion of its, any of its subsidiaries' or Trigon's or any of Trigon's subsidiaries' business or assets), which would
be reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect on Anthem and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on Trigon and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or materially impair the
long-term benefits sought to be derived from the merger. 

        A condition to the parties' respective obligations to consummate the merger is that any waiting period applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or HSR Act, will have expired or earlier termination thereof will have been granted, that the approval of the Virginia State Corporation Commission, together with
any other material governmental regulatory consents and approvals, will have been obtained, and that the approval of the BCBSA will have been obtained, in each case, on terms that satisfy the
materiality standard described above. See "THE MERGER AGREEMENTConditions to Completion of the Merger" on page 77.

        U.S. Antitrust Filing.
    Under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, certain transactions,
including the merger, may not be consummated unless certain waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated. Each of Anthem and Trigon filed a Pre-Merger Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with the Justice Department and the FTC on May 31, 2002. Under the HSR Act, the merger may not be consummated until 30 days after the initial
filing (unless early termination of this waiting period is granted) or, if the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the FTC issues a request for additional information, 30 days
after Anthem and Trigon have complied with such request for additional information (unless this period is shortened pursuant to a grant of early termination). At any time before the effective time of
the merger, the FTC, the Justice Department or others could take action under the antitrust laws with respect to the merger, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the
merger, or to require the divestiture of certain assets of Anthem or Trigon. Anthem and Trigon have no reason to believe that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds is likely to be made or, if
such a challenge is made, that it is likely to be successful.

        Virginia Insurance Regulations.
    Pursuant to the Virginia insurance laws, and in order to consummate the merger, the Virginia
State Corporation Commission must approve the change of control of Trigon. To

accomplish this, on May 31, 2002, Anthem and Trigon filed a Form A "Application for Approval of Acquisition of Control of or Merger with a Domestic Insurer or Health Maintenance
Organization," as required by the Virginia insurance laws, with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The Virginia State Corporation Commission has scheduled a public hearing on the Form A
application to begin July 10, 2002. The Virginia insurance laws provide that the Virginia

State Corporation Commission must approve the change of control unless, after giving notice and opportunity to be heard, the Commission finds that: 

        (1)
following the merger, Trigon's insurance and health maintenance organization, or HMO, subsidiaries would be unable to satisfy requirements for the issuance of the insurance and HMO
licenses that they presently have; 

        (2)
the merger would lessen competition substantially or tend to create a monopoly; 

        (3)
the financial condition of Anthem might jeopardize the financial stability of Trigon's insurance or HMO subsidiaries, or prejudice the interest of their policyholders; 

        (4)
any plans or proposals of Anthem to liquidate Trigon's insurance or HMO subsidiaries, sell their assets or consolidate or merge them with any person, or to make any other material
change in their business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders and not in the public interest; 

        (5)
permitting the merger would not be in the interest of policyholders and the public because of the competence, experience and integrity of the persons who would control the operations
of Trigon after the merger; or 

        (6) after the merger, the surplus to policyholders of any of Trigon's insurance or HMO subsidiaries would not be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities or adequate to its
financial needs.

        Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.
    The BCBSA generally requires that the ultimate controlling entity of an organization be
the licensee and that the licensee guarantee the contractual and financial customer obligations of the licensee's subsidiaries that offer BCBS branded products. The merger will result in Anthem
becoming the ultimate controlling entity of the Trigon subsidiaries, including those that use the BCBS names and marks. Trigon owns the exclusive right to market its products and services using the
BCBS names and marks in the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding a small portion of northern Virginia consisting of suburbs adjacent to Washington, D.C. Trigon's rights to use the BCBS names and marks
may not be transferred to another entity (in the case of the merger, to Anthem) without the
approval of the BCBSA. The process for obtaining approval is initiated by the entity seeking a license. Thereafter, the BCBSA considers the application, and action is taken by its board of directors.
Anthem and Trigon have submitted a joint application requesting that, in connection with and subject to completion of the merger, the BCBSA grant to Anthem the license for the Trigon territory. That
application also includes Anthem's commitment, subject to completion of the merger and the granting of the license to Anthem, to guarantee the contractual and financial obligations to the customers of
certain Trigon subsidiaries. 

        While Anthem and Trigon believe that the requisite regulatory approvals and consents for the merger will be received in a timely manner, Anthem and Trigon cannot give any assurance
regarding the timing of the required approvals and consents or the ability to obtain the required approvals and consents on satisfactory terms or otherwise, or that no action will be brought
challenging the merger or the governmental or other actions.

THE MERGER    

The following discussion contains material information pertaining to the merger. This discussion is subject, and qualified in its entirety
by reference, to the merger agreement, the Trigon stock option agreement and the financial advisor opinions attached as Appendices to this document. We urge you to read and review those entire
documents as well as the discussion in this document.

General  

        This section provides material information about the merger of Anthem and Trigon and the circumstances surrounding the merger. The next sections of this document,
entitled "THE MERGER AGREEMENT" on pages 73 through 88 and "THE TRIGON STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT" on pages 89 through 92, have additional and more detailed information regarding the legal
documents that govern the merger, including information about the conditions to completion of the merger and the provisions for terminating the merger agreement. 

        At
the Anthem special meeting, Anthem shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to issue shares of Anthem common stock in the merger. At the Trigon special meeting,
Trigon shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the merger agreement. Approval of the merger agreement will constitute approval of the transactions it contemplates,
including, among others, the merger of Trigon with and into AI Sub Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem. 

        We
are furnishing this document to Anthem shareholders and Trigon shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of directors of each of Anthem and Trigon for
use at their respective special meeting of shareholders and any adjournment or postponement of the meetings. 

Structure  

        The merger agreement provides for the merger of Trigon with and into AI Sub Acquisition Corp., an Indiana corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Anthem. Upon completion of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Trigon will cease and AI Sub Acquisition Corp. will continue as the surviving corporation. Anthem intends to change the name
of the surviving corporation to "Anthem Southeast, Inc." promptly after the merger.

        Upon completion of the merger, Trigon shareholders will be entitled to receive, subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement, $30.00 in cash, without interest, and 1.062
shares of Anthem common stock for each share of Trigon Class A common stock that they hold. Trigon shareholders will receive cash instead of any fractional shares of Anthem common stock that
would have otherwise been issued at the completion of the merger. The 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock that will be issued for each share of Trigon Class A common stock is sometimes referred
to in this document as the "exchange ratio." If the number of shares of Anthem common stock changes before the merger is completed because of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar event, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment will be made to the exchange ratio. In addition, as explained more fully
beginning on page 84, if Trigon elects to terminate the merger agreement because, at the time we would otherwise complete the merger, the price of Anthem common stock fails to satisfy the
minimum price thresholds set forth in the merger agreement, Anthem will have the right, but not the obligation, to either increase the number of shares of Anthem common stock to be issued for each
share of Trigon Class A common stock or increase the amount of cash to be paid for each share of Trigon Class A common stock, or a combination of both, in order to satisfy the minimum
price criteria contained in the merger agreement.

        As a result of the merger, Anthem shareholders will own approximately 72% and Trigon shareholders will own approximately 28% of the outstanding shares of Anthem common stock. These
percentages are based on the number of shares of Anthem common stock outstanding or issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options as of March 31, 2002 and the number of shares of Trigon
Class A common stock outstanding or issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options as of April 28, 2002.

        Anthem
will account for the merger as a purchase for financial reporting purposes. See "ACCOUNTING TREATMENT" on page 93. The merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes. See "MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER" on page 94. 

Background of the Merger  

        The health benefits industry is undergoing significant consolidation. Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies have been part of this consolidation trend. Prior to
the mid 1980s, there were more than 125 separate Blue Cross or Blue Shield companies. Many of these organizations have merged, reducing the number of independent BCBS plans to 43 as of
December 2001. 

        As
part of its business strategy, Anthem has become one of the leading consolidators of BCBS plans. Its executives meet periodically with executives of other BCBS plans to discuss the
consolidation occurring within the health benefits industry, the strategic implications of such consolidation and Anthem's business and management philosophies and goals. 

        From
time to time over the past few years, Trigon's chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas G. Snead, Jr., has had conversations with various third parties interested in exploring
the possibility of a business combination with Trigon. During this time period, Mr. Snead regularly reviewed with the board of directors Trigon's business and strategic plans and potential
approaches to enhance shareholder value. Except for the discussions described below with Anthem, Mr. Snead had neither solicited nor received any formal offers from any third parties regarding
a possible acquisition of Trigon. 

        In
late 2001, Larry Glasscock, president and chief executive officer of Anthem, met with Mr. Snead. Mr. Glasscock expressed Anthem's interest in commencing a process to
explore a possible business combination with Trigon. 

        In early December 2001, Mr. Snead and a member of Trigon's senior management team met with Mr. Glasscock and two members of Anthem's senior management team in Richmond,
Virginia. Mr. Glasscock and Mr. Snead discussed the long-term strategies and goals of their respective organizations, the similarity of their cultures, their belief in the local nature
of health care and their common focus on operational excellence as the foundation for their competitive approaches. They discussed the strategic options of both firms in light of recent market and
industry developments, including increased merger and acquisition activity within the BCBS system. Mr. Glasscock indicated his interest in entering into preliminary discussions with Trigon
about a possible business combination, although no terms of a possible transaction were discussed.

        At
the regularly scheduled December 12, 2001 meeting of Trigon's board of directors, senior management and Bear Stearns reviewed with the board various factors influencing the
health benefits industry in general and Trigon specifically, the various strategic alternatives potentially available to Trigon, in light of market and industry developments including Anthem's recent
successful initial public offering, the announcement of the proposed sale of CareFirst, Inc. (the BCBS plan operating in Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia) to Wellpoint Health Networks,
Inc., and recent announcements by other regional BCBS plans regarding progress in their efforts to convert to for-profit public companies. The participants discussed the advantages and
disadvantages of a variety of alternatives, including continuing with Trigon's current business plan, growing through strategic
acquisitions of other companies, and a merger with, or acquisition by, a larger company in the health benefits industry. Senior management and Bear Stearns also discussed with the board companies that
would likely be interested in a business combination with Trigon. Mr. Snead relayed to the board his recent informal discussions with Mr. Glasscock, including his expression of interest
in initiating discussions regarding a possible transaction with Trigon. The directors discussed the matter further with senior Trigon management and Trigons' financial and legal advisors, and the
members of the board indicated that it would be desirable to schedule a further meeting of the Trigon board to discuss in 

greater detail the health benefits market, the outlook for Trigon and Trigon's various strategic alternatives. 

        On
December 20, 2001, a special meeting of the Trigon board of directors was held to review more fully the strategic options available to the company. Mr. Snead discussed
with the board the various risks and opportunities relating to Trigon's current business plan and remarked on the decreasing opportunities for growth through acquisitions in view of increasing
consolidation in the health benefits industry. Mr. Snead expressed his view that in view of his initial contacts with Mr. Glasscock and management's analysis of Anthem, Trigon should
consider entering into discussions with Anthem about a possible strategic business combination. At the conclusion of the meeting, after discussion with its financial and legal advisors, the Trigon
board of directors authorized Mr. Snead to renew exploratory discussions with Anthem regarding a possible strategic business combination. 

        From
late December 2001 to the third week of January 2002, Mr. Glasscock and Mr. Snead spoke several times via telephone and met individually and together with their
respective financial advisors. During this time, Messrs. Glasscock and Snead had further discussions regarding their respective companies and the possible strategic and economic benefits to both
companies from a potential business combination. 

        During
this period, Mr. Glasscock made an initial proposal to combine Anthem with Trigon in an exchange of cash and stock that, based on the then market price of Anthem common
stock, would provide Trigon shareholders a premium to the then current market price of Trigon Class A common stock, and suggested that the companies exchange due diligence information.
Mr. Snead indicated that he believed that the Trigon board of directors would likely find the value implied by such proposal to be insufficient. 

        On
January 21, 2002, Mr. Glasscock called Mr. Snead and reiterated his belief in the strategic rationale for a merger and his desire to continue discussions.
Mr. Glasscock indicated that Anthem would share confidential information with Trigon senior management if the parties executed a confidentiality agreement. 

        On
January 28, 2002, a special meeting of the board of directors of Trigon was held. At the meeting, Mr. Snead updated the board on his discussions with
Mr. Glasscock and outlined Anthem's offer to share confidential information with Trigon. Trigon's legal advisor briefed the Trigon board of directors
on its fiduciary duties under the circumstances, and its legal and financial advisors reviewed possible responses to Mr. Glasscock's proposal. Trigon's board then indicated its support for a
more detailed review of Anthem's strategy, organization, performance and prospects by members of Trigon senior management. 

        At
a regular meeting of the Anthem board of directors on January 28, 2002, Mr. Glasscock reviewed in detail with Anthem's board the discussions between the two companies.
Publicly available background information on Trigon was also reviewed, and the strategic and financial opportunities presented by a combination of the two companies were reviewed and discussed.
Anthem's board encouraged management to continue the discussions. 

        Trigon's
representatives and Anthem's representatives then negotiated a confidentiality agreement which was executed on February 5, 2002, after which Trigon management requested
detailed information about Anthem. 

        On
February 12, 2002, Mr. Snead and other members of Trigon's senior management and its financial advisor attended a meeting with Mr. Glasscock and other senior
management of Anthem and its financial advisor in Indianapolis, Indiana, during which Anthem management presented an overview of Anthem, its business strategies, plans and forecasts, and both
management teams discussed the similarities of the businesses of their respective companies and the opportunities presented by a combination of the two companies. After the senior management
discussion, Mr. Snead and Mr. Glasscock met privately. Mr. Glasscock indicated his desire to combine Anthem with Trigon in an exchange of cash and stock that, based on the then
market price of Anthem common stock, would 

deliver Trigon shareholders a premium to the current market price of Trigon Class A common stock and suggested that Trigon provide Anthem due diligence information in order to permit the
parties to further develop their respective views regarding the value of the consideration to be paid in any possible transaction. 

        On
February 20, 2002, Trigon held a regularly scheduled board meeting. Mr. Snead and Trigon's senior management team described their observations and conclusions from their
due diligence review of Anthem. Mr. Snead relayed the proposal from Mr. Glasscock and his request for additional information. Trigon's legal advisor briefed the Trigon board of directors
on its fiduciary duties under the circumstances, and its legal and financial advisors reviewed various alternatives. The board authorized Trigon management to share certain confidential information
with Anthem. 

        On
March 13, 2002, Mr. Glasscock and members of Anthem's senior management and its financial advisor met with Mr. Snead and various representatives of Trigon and its
financial advisor in Richmond, Virginia, at which time Trigon management presented an overview of Trigon and its business strategies, plans and forecasts. At this meeting and afterwards, Trigon made
available various due diligence materials requested by Anthem. 

        On
March 26, 2002, members of Anthem's senior management and its financial advisor met with various representatives of Trigon and its financial advisor in Richmond, Virginia.
Trigon made available additional due diligence materials requested by Anthem, and the parties discussed in detail the value creation opportunities that might be developed through a combination of the
two companies. Trigon continued to make available various due diligence materials requested by Anthem thereafter. 

        During
the second week of April 2002, Mr. Glasscock and Anthem's financial advisor and Mr. Snead and Trigon's financial advisor spoke several times via telephone and met in
Richmond, Virginia. They discussed in greater detail the potential terms, including the merger consideration, and the strategic and economic benefits of a merger. 

        On
April 14, 2002, at a special meeting of the Anthem board of directors, the board received a comprehensive update on the discussions between the two companies. Anthem's
financial and legal advisors outlined the preliminary terms of a proposed transaction. In addition, the board discussed the strategic and financial benefits and risks of a merger. Anthem's board
authorized Anthem senior management to continue negotiations with Trigon towards a possible business combination. 

        On
April 16, 2002, a special meeting of Trigon's board of directors was held, at which Mr. Snead and the company's financial advisor outlined the current terms of Anthem's
proposal. Trigon's legal advisor briefed the Trigon board of directors on its fiduciary duties under the circumstances, and its legal and financial advisors reviewed Trigon's alternatives.
Mr. Snead stated that he viewed a combination with Anthem as having strong strategic value for the company and its shareholders. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Trigon board of directors
authorized Trigon's senior management to continue negotiations with Anthem towards a possible business combination. 

        Later
that evening, Mr. Snead, several other Trigon senior managers and Trigon's financial advisor had a telephone conference with Mr. Glasscock, several other Anthem
senior managers and Anthem's financial advisor regarding the material terms of the Anthem proposal. Conversations between these parties continued into the evening of April 17, 2002, at which
point Mr. Glasscock increased the proposed financial terms to $30.00 in cash, without interest, plus 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock for each share of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        On April 18, 2002, the board of directors of Trigon held a meeting to consider the terms of Anthem's revised proposal. At the meeting, the board reviewed a written summary of
terms of the proposed transaction with members of Trigon's senior management and its legal and financial advisors. After discussing the terms, including a number of changes suggested by Trigon's legal
and financial advisors, the Trigon board of directors authorized Trigon's senior management to continue negotiations with Anthem towards a possible business combination on substantially the terms
discussed.

        In
addition, on April 18, 2002, a special meeting of the Anthem board of directors was held. At the meeting, the board reviewed a proposed term sheet with respect to the proposed
merger with members of Anthem's senior management and Anthem's legal and financial advisors. The Anthem board also reviewed the rationale for, and potential benefits of the proposed merger and
authorized senior management to proceed with the negotiations. 

        On
various dates between April 18, 2002 and April 27, 2002, members of Trigon management and its legal and financial advisors met or had telephone conversations with
members of Anthem management and its legal and financial advisors to negotiate a definitive merger agreement, stock option agreement and employee related agreements. 

        On
April 18, 19 and 20, 2002, members of the Anthem senior management team and their legal advisors met with members of the Trigon management team in Richmond, Virginia and
reviewed additional due diligence materials requested by Anthem. 

        On
April 22, 2002, members of the Trigon senior management team and their legal advisors met with members of the Anthem management team in Indianapolis, Indiana and reviewed
additional due diligence materials requested by Trigon. 

        On
April 23, 2002, Trigon's board held a special meeting to discuss in detail the proposed business combination. The board reviewed Trigon's performance, prospects and strategic
alternatives. Mr. Snead reviewed the activities and discussions of the past weeks, and presented a summary of the proposed transaction, the strategic rationale that supported it, the economic
and operational benefits that it could create, the corporate organization structure after closing, the governance representation to be provided by Trigon, and the impact that the transaction would be
expected to have on each of the key constituent groups served by Trigon. Senior management presented the forecast and synergies upon which the merger valuation was predicated, and outlined the
findings of the due diligence process in which the Trigon senior management team had engaged over the prior weeks. Mr. Glasscock attended a portion of the meeting and discussed Anthem's vision,
strategy and operating approach and responded to questions of the Trigon board. Through the company's legal advisors, the Trigon board received detailed information regarding the proposed transaction,
including a comprehensive overview of the terms of the merger agreement and employment agreements, and of their fiduciary duties under the circumstances. Trigon's financial advisor reviewed with the
Trigon board financial aspects of the merger, including detailed financial analyses of the financial terms of the proposed merger. Bear Stearns stated that it would be able to give its opinion,
barring any unforeseen events, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the per share merger consideration to be paid to holders of Trigon Class A common stock based on such
analyses. Mr. Snead discussed the proposed plan for the execution and communication of the transaction to various stakeholders. No action was taken by the Trigon board of directors at this
meeting. The parties continued negotiation of the terms of a definitive merger agreement, stock option agreement and employment and retention-related matters. 

        The
Anthem board of directors met on April 26, 2002 in Tucson, Arizona. Mr. Glasscock reviewed the activities and discussions of the past weeks, and presented a summary of
the proposed transaction, the rationale that supported it, and the financial and strategic benefits that it was expected to create. Senior management presented the forecast and synergies upon which
the merger valuation was predicated and outlined the findings of the due diligence process in which the Anthem management team had engaged over the prior weeks. Anthem's legal advisor reviewed in
detail with the Anthem board information regarding the proposed transaction, including a comprehensive overview of the terms of the merger agreement, the stock option agreement and the employee
related agreements. Anthem's legal advisor also reviewed with the board the fiduciary duties of Anthem's directors. At this meeting, Goldman Sachs provided the Anthem board of directors a detailed
analysis of the financial terms of the proposed combination and an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 28, 2002, that, as of that date,
the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to Anthem. At the conclusion of this meeting, the Anthem board of
directors unanimously approved the merger 

agreement, the stock option agreement and the employee related agreements and authorized the signing thereof. 

        On
April 27, 2002, the Trigon board of directors held a meeting. Mr. Snead reviewed in detail the proposed transaction terms as reflected in the draft definitive agreements
and the strategic rationale for the merger. Senior management then summarized the results of Trigon's due diligence investigation of Anthem and its business operations that were reported on in detail
at the April 23 meeting and information about Anthem's arrangements for financing the cash component of the merger consideration. At this meeting, Bear Stearns reviewed with the Trigon board of
directors its detailed, updated analyses of the financial terms of the proposed merger and provided an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated the same
date, that as of such date, the per share merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock. Trigon's legal advisors discussed in
detail the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements. At the conclusion of this meeting, the Trigon board of directors unanimously authorized the signing of the merger agreement, the stock
option agreement and the employee related agreements. 

        Following
such meeting, on April 28, 2002, Anthem and Trigon signed the merger agreement, the stock option agreement and the employee related agreements. 

        On
April 29, 2002, the parties publicly announced the proposed merger. 

Anthem's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Anthem's Board of Directors  

        The Anthem board of directors believes that the merger presents a unique opportunity to combine and expand two complementary health benefits companies. The Anthem
board consulted with financial and other advisors and determined that the merger was consistent with the strategic plans of Anthem and
was in the best interests of Anthem and its shareholders. In reaching its conclusion to unanimously approve the merger agreement, the Anthem board considered a number of factors, including the
following: 

         Strategic growth.
    The Anthem board observed that the acquisition of Trigon will provide Anthem with an excellent opportunity to expand
its products
and services to a new region as well as to capitalize upon Anthem's and Trigon's business models. The Anthem board took note of the fact that Trigon holds the number one market share position in
Virginia, with 2.1 million members and approximately 35% of the market, and that, after the merger is completed, the combined company will be the fifth largest publicly traded health benefits
company as measured either by revenues or by medical membership. In addition, the board took into account the opportunity to share best practices among the companies, including: 


Trigon's
history of growth in profitable enrollment; 

Trigon's
operating efficiencies as demonstrated by its operating margins; 

Trigon's
expertise in the individual and small group markets; 

Trigon's
strong management and operating expertise; 

Trigon's
outstanding sales and marketing operations; 

Trigon's
imaging technology, which may be useful on a larger scale; and 

Trigon's
experience in the disease management area through its subsidiary Health Management Corporation, or HMC, one of the largest disease management
companies in the nation. 

        Synergies.
    The board observed that the synergies expected from the merger should result in expense savings and revenue enhancements. The
board took
into account the fact that the parties expect post-closing pre-tax synergies of at least $40 million in 2003 and at least $75 million in 

annual pre-tax synergies by 2004. Anthem's management outlined the following synergy opportunities, among others: 


by
applying Anthem's investment management model to Trigon's portfolio and through integration of investment activities, Anthem expects to increase
pre-tax earnings by $10 million to $15 million per year; 

Anthem
expects to be able to save about $20 million to $25 million per year by developing technologies that can be shared by both companies,
consolidating certain existing data center functions, taking advantage of volume discounts and eliminating duplicate software licenses and other technology redundancies;


Anthem
expects to be able to save about $10 million to $15 million annually through the elimination of Anthem's and Trigon's redundant public
company costs, reduced legal and audit fees, reduced BCBSA dues, reduced insurance expenses, elimination of redundant directors' fees and expenses, and elimination of redundant shareholder services
and other back office redundancies; and


Anthem
expects to be able to generate approximately $15 million to $20 million in additional operating gain from the opportunity for additional
penetration of Anthem's specialty products in the Virginia market. 

        Anthem's
management also discussed additional synergies identified during due diligence. 

        Similar corporate cultures.
    The board considered management's belief that Anthem and Trigon have similar corporate cultures and values
focused on
providing quality products and services to customers, the complementary nature of the two companies' operations and operating regions, and the experience, reputation and financial strength of Trigon. 

        Trends in the health benefits industry.
    The Anthem board considered the current environment and trends in the health benefits industry, including the
regulatory uncertainty related to managed care generally and industry consolidation. The Anthem board considered the advantage that large companies have in such an environment and that the increased
size and scope of the combined company would place it in a better position to take advantage of growth opportunities, meet competitive pressures and serve customers more efficiently.

         Effect on earnings per share.
    The board noted management's view that, assuming the projected synergies are realized, the merger is
expected to be
essentially neutral to Anthem's 2003 earnings per share and is expected to be accretive to earnings thereafter. In addition, realizing such synergies should allow Anthem to continue its strategy of
generating at least 15% earnings per share growth annually for its shareholders. 

        Revenue and revenue enhancements.
    The board took note of the opportunity for additional penetration of Anthem's specialty products into
Trigon's
customer base, as well as the ability to potentially offer HMC disease management programs to Anthem's customer base. The board further noted the fact that the combined company is anticipated to have
cash flows of nearly $900 million, well in excess of anticipated net income, and that the merger offers the opportunity for continued margin improvement. 

         Additional growth.
    The board noted that there is ample opportunity for Trigon to sustain growth in its core health benefits offerings
in light of the
structure of the Virginia market. At six times the size of its nearest competitor, Trigon is one of the most uniquely positioned health plans in the nation in terms of market advantages. Nearly 40% of
the Virginia market is comprised of indemnity health products offered by nearly 400 insurers, some of which are already beginning to exit the Virginia marketplace. 

         Merger consideration and stock prices.
    The board took into account that the consideration to be paid in the merger was consistent with
recent
comparable transactions in the health benefits 

industry. In connection with this review, the board also considered the relative contributions of Trigon and Anthem to certain pro forma income statement and balance sheet items as prepared by
management. The board also took note of the historical and current market prices of Anthem common stock and Trigon common stock. 

        Financing.
    The board considered Anthem's ability to borrow and repay the funds needed for the cash portion of the merger consideration and for
transaction costs, on both a short and long-term basis. It reviewed possible funding needs for potential future transactions, including Anthem's share repurchase program and the pending acquisition of
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc. The board also noted the likely impact of a borrowing on its financial strength and credit ratings.

         Personnel.
    The board considered the fact that, upon completion of the merger, Thomas G. Snead, Jr., current Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of
Trigon, will become the President of Anthem's Southeast Region and that Thomas Byrd, current Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Trigon, will serve in various financial and other
management roles in Anthem's Southeast Region. The
board also considered the fact that upon completion of the merger, three of Trigon's current non-employee directors will become members of Anthem's board of directors. 

        Recent acquisitions.
    The board also noted Anthem's record of successfully integrating past acquisitions without sacrificing continuous
improvement in
profitability. 

         Continuity.
    The board considered the ability of Anthem to maintain continuity of management and of corporate structure, including
retention of 13
directors and the chief executive officer position, as well as its governing documents under the proposed merger. 

        Due diligence.
    The board considered the reports of management and outside advisors concerning the operations, financial condition and
prospects of
Trigon. 

         Tax treatment.
    The board considered that the intended treatment of the merger would be as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

         Regulatory approvals and clearances.
    The board considered its belief, after consultation with its legal counsel, that the regulatory
approvals and
clearances necessary to complete the merger would be obtained. 

         Transaction agreements.
    The board reviewed the terms of the merger agreement, the Trigon stock option agreement and the employee
related agreements. 

         Goldman, Sachs & Co. opinion.
    The board evaluated the detailed financial analyses and presentation of Goldman,
Sachs & Co. as well as
its opinion that, based on and subject to the considerations set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to Anthem. We have described the opinion of
Goldman, Sachs & Co. in detail under the heading "THE MERGEROpinion of Anthem's Financial AdvisorGoldman, Sachs & Co.," on page 50. 

        The
Anthem board of directors weighed these advantages and opportunities against the challenges inherent in the combination of two business enterprises of the size and scope of Anthem
and Trigon
and the possible resulting diversion of management attention for an extended period of time. The Anthem board realized that there can be no assurance about future results, including results expected
or considered in the factors listed above, such as assumptions regarding price-to-earnings multiples, potential revenue enhancements, anticipated cost savings and earnings
accretion. However, the Anthem board concluded that the potential positive factors outweighed the potential risks of consummating the merger. 

        The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Anthem board of directors is not exhaustive, but includes all material factors considered by the Anthem board.
In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Anthem board in connection with its evaluation of the 

merger and the complexity of such matters, the Anthem board did not consider it practical to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that
it considered in reaching its decision. The Anthem board discussed the factors described above, asked questions of Anthem's management and Anthem's legal and financial advisors, and reached general
consensus that the merger was advisable and in the best interests of Anthem and its shareholders. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the Anthem board of directors may
have given different weight to different factors. It should be noted that this explanation of the Anthem board's reasoning and all other information presented in this section is forward-looking in
nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the heading "CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" on page 26. 

At a special meeting held on April 26, 2002, after due consideration with financial and legal advisors, the Anthem board of directors unanimously approved
the merger agreement. Accordingly, the Anthem board of directors unanimously recommends that Anthem shareholders vote "FOR" the issuance of Anthem common stock in the merger.

Trigon's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of Trigon's Board of Directors  

        At a special meeting held on April 27, 2002, after due consideration and consultation with financial and other advisors, the Trigon board of directors
unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Trigon and its shareholders. The Trigon board unanimously
adopted the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Trigon shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.
In reaching its conclusion to unanimously adopt the merger agreement and to recommend that Trigon shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement, the Trigon board considered a number of factors,
including the following: 

         Merger consideration.
    The Trigon board considered the relationship of the consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger to recent and
historical
market prices of Trigon Class A common stock. The merger consideration represents an implied value for one share of Trigon Class A common stock as of
April 26, 2002, the last business day prior to the announcement of the merger transaction, of $105.08, based on the closing price of Anthem common stock on that date. This implied value
represents a 24.7% premium over the $84.25 closing price of Trigon Class A common stock on April 26, 2002, a 36.6% premium over the $76.94 average closing price of Trigon Class A
common stock for the 20-day period ending on April 26, 2002, and a 57.6% premium over the $66.68 average closing price of Trigon Class A common stock for the 52-week period ending on
April 26, 2002. 

        The
Trigon board also considered the form of the merger consideration to be received in the merger by the holders of Trigon Class A common stock. The Trigon board considered the
certainty of the value of the cash component of the merger consideration as well as the ability of holders of Trigon Class A common stock to become holders of Anthem common stock and
participate in the future prospects of the combined businesses of Anthem and Trigon. 

         Strategic alternatives.
    The Trigon board considered trends and competitive developments in the health benefits industry and the range
of strategic
alternatives available to Trigon, including Trigon continuing its existing strategy of seeking internal growth and improving its cost structure. 

         Similar corporate cultures and operating philosophies.
    The Trigon board considered management's belief that Anthem and Trigon have
similar corporate
cultures focused on providing quality products and services to customers, the complementary nature of the two companies' operations and operating regions, and the experience, reputation and financial
strength of Anthem, including its proven track record of quickly and successfully integrating acquisitions. In addition, the Trigon board considered Anthem's operating philosophy, which provides
significant decision making responsibility to local management, thereby allowing local managers to more effectively 

deliver products and services to members. Furthermore, the Trigon board considered Anthem's belief that its ongoing growth is dependent upon its commitment to work with providers to optimize the cost
and quality of care while improving the health of its members and improving the quality of its service. 

         Increased size and strength.
    After the merger is completed, the combined company is expected to be the fifth largest publicly traded
health benefits
company as measured either by revenues or by medical membership. The combined company will have annual revenues of over $13 billion, over $11 billion in assets and over 10 million
members, which will solidify the combined company's position as a top-tier health benefits industry leader. The Trigon board considered this size and scope, which would allow the combined
company to compete more effectively in the increasingly competitive market for health benefits, to be in a better position to take advantage of growth opportunities and to serve customers more
efficiently. The Trigon board believed that the combined company would be financially stronger, with a broader customer base, than Trigon would be as an independent entity. 

        Synergies of the combination.
    The Trigon board considered its knowledge of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and
prospects of
Anthem. Based on these considerations, the Trigon board considered the benefits that would be derived from the complementary strengths and regional coverage of the two companies, including the
superior growth opportunity for the combined company. The Trigon board considered the ability of the combined company to achieve better economies of scale and thereby enhance profitability by
leveraging the experienced management teams and best practices from both companies and extending each company's geographical reach. The Trigon board also considered the ability of the combined company
to achieve operating efficiencies from technology, investment management, redundant supporting services and further penetration of specialty products. The Trigon board considered that the synergies
expected from the merger should result in expense savings and revenue enhancements. The Trigon board took into account that the parties expect post-closing pre-tax synergies of
at least $40 million in 2003 and at least $75 million in annual pre-tax synergies by 2004. 

         Corporate governance.
    The Trigon board considered the corporate governance aspects of the merger, including that (a) at the
closing of the
merger, Thomas G. Snead, Jr., the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Trigon will be named the President of Anthem's Southeast Region, with the responsibility for Anthem's health benefits
operations in the Southeast Region, (b) at the closing of the merger, several other Trigon executives including Thomas Byrd, the current Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of
Trigon, will serve in various financial and other management roles in Anthem's Southeast Region and (c) immediately after the closing of the merger, Anthem will appoint three of Trigon's
current non-employee directors to Anthem's board of directors. 

         Community presence and involvement.
    The Trigon board considered the location of the headquarters and the principal executive offices of
Anthem's
Southeast Region and of Trigon BCBS, both of which will be in Richmond, Virginia. The communities served by the expanded company should benefit from a combined company that is expected to compete more
effectively in the health benefits industry. 

        Continuation of BCBS affiliation.
    The Trigon board considered that Trigon's long tradition as a BCBS licensee would continue following the merger
with Anthem because Anthem would continue to operate Trigon BCBS as part of its newly created Southeast Region.

        Impact on Trigon employees.
    The Trigon board considered the potential benefits to Trigon employees from the expanded opportunities
available to
employees of a larger organization. 

        Changes and consolidation in the health benefits industry.
    The Trigon board considered the current environment of the health benefits industry,
including the regulatory uncertainty related to

managed care generally, and the trends toward consolidation in the industry in order to obtain the advantage of scale in developing and delivering products in a cost-effective manner. The
Trigon board noted that the health benefits industry is increasingly competitive and to be successful over the long-term, Trigon needed to be strategically positioned to provide its members with
access to a wide range of health benefits products and services that are competitively priced and locally delivered. The Trigon board considered the likelihood that the merger would better position
Trigon to address changes in the industry, to meet competitive pressures and to develop and deliver new products and value to current and potential customers.

        Tax treatment.
    The Trigon board considered that the intended treatment of the merger would be as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

         Regulatory approvals and clearances.
    The Trigon board considered the likelihood, after consultation with its legal counsel, that the
regulatory
approvals and clearances necessary to complete the merger would be obtained. 

        Transaction agreements.
    The Trigon board reviewed the terms of the merger agreement, the Trigon stock option agreement and the employee related
agreements.

         Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. opinion.
    The Trigon board of directors evaluated the detailed financial analyses and
presentation of Bear
Stearns as well as its opinion that, based on and subject to the considerations set forth in the opinion, as of the date of such opinion, the per share merger consideration is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock. We have described the opinion of Bear Stearns in detail under the heading "THE MERGEROpinion of Trigon's Financial
AdvisorBear, Stearns & Co. Inc." on page 59. 

        The
Trigon board of directors weighed these advantages and opportunities against the challenges inherent in the combination of two business enterprises of the size and scope of Anthem
and Trigon and the possible resulting diversion of management attention for an extended period of time. The Trigon board also considered the implications associated with a fixed exchange ratio. The
Trigon board realizes that there can be no assurance about future results, including results expected or considered in the factors listed above, such as assumptions regarding long-term
value, competitive and financial strength, synergies and anticipated cost savings. However, the Trigon board concluded that the potential positive factors outweighed the potential risks of completing
the merger. It should be noted that this explanation of the Trigon board's reasoning and all other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in
light of the factors discussed under the heading "CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" on

page 26. The Trigon board of directors also considered the fact that some members of the board and of Trigon management may have interests in the merger that are different from those of
shareholders generally. See "THE MERGERInterests of Trigon's Directors and Officers in the Merger that Differ From Your Interests" on page 68.

        The
foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Trigon board of directors is not exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the Trigon board.
In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Trigon board in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of such matters, the Trigon board did not consider it practical
to, nor did it attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors that it considered in reaching its decision. In considering the factors described above,
individual members of the Trigon board may have given different weight to different factors. 

At a special meeting held on April 27, 2002, the Trigon board of directors determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Trigon and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Trigon board of directors unanimously adopted the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that
Trigon shareholders vote "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

Opinion of Anthem's Financial AdvisorGoldman, Sachs & Co.  

        Goldman Sachs delivered its written opinion to Anthem's board of directors to the effect that, as of April 28, 2002, and based upon and subject to the
factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the $30.00 in cash and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock to be paid for each outstanding share of Trigon Class A common stock is fair, from a
financial point of view, to Anthem. 

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated April 28, 2002, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered
and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Appendix C. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of Anthem's board of
directors in its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Anthem shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote. Anthem shareholders are
urged to read the opinion in its entirety.

        In
connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analysis, Goldman Sachs, among other things: 


reviewed
the merger agreement; 

reviewed
Annual Reports to Shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Trigon for the five years ended December 31, 2001; 

reviewed
the Annual Report to Shareholders and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for Anthem for the year ended December 31, 2001;

to the initial public offering of Anthem common stock and Anthem's 6.00% Equity Security Units; 

reviewed
certain interim reports to shareholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Trigon and Anthem; 

reviewed
certain other communications from Anthem and Trigon to their respective shareholders;

        Goldman
Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and assumed such accuracy and
completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with Anthem's consent, that the internal financial analyses and forecasts for Anthem and Trigon prepared by
the management of Anthem, including the synergies projected to result from the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting Anthem's best currently
available estimates 

and judgments, and that these forecasts and synergies would be realized in the amounts and time periods contemplated thereby. Goldman Sachs was advised that the management of Anthem believes the
merger is important to Anthem's overall strategic goals, including extending its geographic reach into the Southeast. Goldman Sachs is not an actuarial firm and its services did not include any
actuarial determinations or evaluations by Goldman Sachs or an attempt to evaluate actuarial assumptions. Goldman Sachs made no analyses of, and expresses no opinion as to, the adequacy of the
reserves of Anthem or Trigon and relied upon information supplied to it by Anthem and Trigon as to such adequacy. In addition, Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the
assets and liabilities (including any derivative or off-balance sheet assets or liabilities or insurance reserves) of Anthem or Trigon or any of their respective subsidiaries and Goldman
Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs also assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents or approvals necessary for the consummation of
the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement will be obtained without any adverse effect on Anthem or Trigon or on the expected benefits to be realized from the transaction contemplated by the
merger agreement. 

        The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Goldman Sachs in connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs. The order of analyses described, and the results of those analyses, do not represent relative importance or weight
given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand such analyses, the tables must

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
    Goldman Sachs performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine a range of implied
present values per share of Trigon Class A common stock. All cash flows were discounted back to December 31, 2002. In performing this analysis, Goldman Sachs used projections supplied by
the management of Anthem that did not include any of the synergies expected to result from the transaction. Using discount rates ranging from 11% to 15%, and terminal EBITDA multiples ranging from
9.0x to 13.0x, this analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $85.94 to $128.56 per share of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Using
the same set of projections, Goldman Sachs also performed a sensitivity analysis to illustrate the effect of increases or decreases in sales growth and EBIT margin. The analysis
was based on a 13% discount rate and a terminal EBITDA multiple of 11.0x, and used a range of changes in sales growth of -2.0% to 2.0% and a range of changes in EBIT margin from
- -2.0% to 2.0%. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $74.60 to $141.33 per share of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Utilizing
a range of perpetuity growth rates from 5.0% to 9.0% instead of terminal EBITDA multiples, Goldman Sachs performed another discounted cash flow analysis, using the same set of
projections and range of discount rates. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values from $70.37 to $279.89 per share of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Using
a perpetuity growth rate instead of a terminal EBITDA multiple, Goldman Sachs performed another sensitivity analysis to illustrate the effect of increases or decreases in sales
growth and EBIT margin. The analysis was based on a 13% discount rate and a perpetuity growth rate of 7%, and used a range of changes in sales growth of -2.0% to 2.0% and a range of
changes in EBIT margin from -2.0% to 2.0%. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $72.01 to $143.95 per share of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Goldman
Sachs also performed a discounted cash flow analysis using projections supplied by the management of Anthem that included synergies expected to result from the transaction. Using
discount rates ranging from 11% to 15%, and terminal EBITDA multiples ranging from 9.0x-13.0x, this analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $100.17 to $150.27 per share
of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Using
the same set of projections, Goldman Sachs also performed a sensitivity analysis to illustrate the effect of increases or decreases in sales growth and EBIT margin. The analysis
was based on a 13% discount rate and a terminal EBITDA multiple of 11.0x, and used a range of changes in sales growth from -2.0% to 2.0% and a range of changes in EBIT margin from
- -2.0% to 2.0%. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $90.93 to $160.48 per share of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Utilizing
a range of perpetuity growth rates from 5.0% to 9.0% instead of terminal EBITDA multiples, Goldman Sachs performed another discounted cash flow analysis using the same
projections 

and range of discount rates. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $82.78 to $333.07 per share of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Using
a perpetuity growth rate instead of a terminal EBITDA multiple, Goldman Sachs also performed another sensitivity analysis to illustrate the effect of increases or decreases in
sales growth and EBIT margin. The analysis was based on a 13% discount rate and a perpetuity growth rate of 7.0%, and used a range of changes in sales growth of -2.0% to 2.0% and a range
of changes in EBIT margin from -2.0%
to 2.0%. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $89.76 to $164.82 per share of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Exchange Ratio Analysis.
    Goldman Sachs calculated the average adjusted historical exchange ratios of Trigon Class A
common stock to Anthem common stock based on the closing prices of Trigon Class A common stock and Anthem common stock for the thirty-day, sixty-day, and
ninety-day periods ended April 25, 2002. After taking into account the $30.00 in cash component of the consideration to be paid for each share of Trigon Class A common stock,
this analysis indicated that the average adjusted historical exchange ratios for such periods were 0.74x, 0.76x and 0.78x and the range of adjusted historical exchange ratios for the period from
October 29, 2001 to April 25, 2002 was 0.68x to 0.94x. 

        Contribution Analysis.
    Goldman Sachs analyzed the relative contributions of Trigon and Anthem to certain income statement
items for the projected fiscal years 2003 and 2004 as well as the equity and enterprise valuations for the combined company. Estimates of 2003 and 2004 total operating revenue, EBITDA, EBIT and net
income were based on projections prepared by the management of Anthem for both Anthem and Trigon that did not include any of the synergies expected to result from the transaction. This analysis
indicated that Trigon would contribute, for years 2003 and 2004, respectively, the following to the combined company: 23.5% and 23.2% of total operating revenue; 28.7% and 26.8% of EBITDA; 28.6% and
27.7% of EBIT; and 30.1% and 28.9% of net income. This analysis further indicated that Trigon would contribute 29.4% and 29.2% of the diluted equity market capitalization and enterprise value,
respectively, of the combined company. After taking into account the $30.00 in cash component of the consideration to be paid for each share of Trigon Class A Common Stock and using a weighted
average multiple to calculate implied per share values, this analysis resulted in a range of adjusted implied exchange ratios of 0.442x to 0.769x. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the relative
contributions of Trigon and Anthem to the combined total membership of the two companies based on membership figures as of December 31, 2001. This analysis indicated that Trigon would
contribute 21.3% of the combined total membership. 

        Goldman
Sachs also performed and utilized discounted cash flow analysis to determine the relative contribution of Trigon and Anthem to the present equity value of the combined company
and to derive a range of adjusted implied exchange ratios. Using estimates prepared by the management of Anthem for both Anthem and Trigon that did not include any of the synergies expected to result
from the transaction, a discount rate of 13% and terminal EBITDA multiples of 9.0x to 13.0x, Goldman Sachs determined a range of implied present equity values and implied present per share values for
Anthem and Trigon and the Anthem common stock and the Trigon Class A common stock, respectively. Based on those implied equity values, this analysis indicated that Trigon would contribute 22.7%
to 34.2% of the implied present equity value of the combined company. Based on the implied present values per share and taking into account the $30.00 in cash component of the consideration to be paid
for each share of Trigon Class A common stock, this analysis resulted in a range of adjusted implied exchange ratios of 0.571x to 1.124x. 

        Pro Forma Analyses.
    Goldman Sachs analyzed the pro forma impact of the merger on earnings per share from the point of view of
the holders of Anthem common stock. Based upon estimates prepared by the management of Anthem for both Anthem and Trigon, including the synergies expected to result from the transaction, and excluding
the effects of future stock repurchases, this analysis 

indicated that the merger would be slightly dilutive to earnings per share in 2003 and slightly accretive to earnings per share in 2004. 

        The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the
summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to
fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to Trigon, Anthem or the merger. 

        Goldman
Sachs prepared these analyses solely for purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing its opinion to the Anthem board of directors. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals, nor do
they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of Anthem, Trigon, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are different from those forecast. 

        As
described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to Anthem's board of directors was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Anthem board of directors in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Appendix C. 

        Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities and private placements as well as for estate, corporate and other
purposes. Goldman Sachs is familiar with Anthem having provided certain investment banking services to Anthem from time to time, including having acted as its financial advisor in connection with its
acquisition of New Hampshire-Vermont Health Service d/b/a Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Hampshire in February 1999, its Alliance Agreement with Rocky Mountain Hospital and Medical Service d/b/a
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Colorado in March 1999 and its acquisition of Associated Hospital Service d/b/a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Maine in July 1999; having acted as its financial
advisor in connection with the sale of its TRICARE business to Humana Inc. in June 2001; having acted as its financial advisor in connection with its demutualization; having acted as
lead managing underwriter of Anthem's initial public offering of 55,200,000 shares of Anthem common stock and 4,600,000 of Anthem's 6.00% Equity Security Units in October 2001; having
coordinated a Large Holder Sale Program for Anthem common stock since its initial public offering; having acted as financial advisor in connection with its pending acquisition of

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc., announced in January 2001; and having acted as its financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in certain negotiations
leading to, the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co., is the sole lead arranger, bookrunner and administrative agent in connection with the
$1.2 billion bridge loan facility that Anthem has entered into in connection with the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. In addition, Goldman Sachs may provide other investment
banking services to Anthem in the future. The Anthem board of directors selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has
substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger.

        Goldman
Sachs also has provided certain investment banking services to Trigon from time to time, including having acted as its financial advisor in connection with its proposed
acquisition of Cerulean Companies, Inc. in November 2000. Goldman, Sachs & Co. provides a full range of financial advisory and securities services and, in the course of its normal
trading activities, may from time to time effect transactions and hold positions in securities, including derivative securities, of Anthem or Trigon for its own account and for the account of
customers. 

        Pursuant
to a letter agreement dated December 5, 2001, Anthem engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated merger. Under the terms of
this engagement letter, Anthem has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a customary transaction fee, a portion of which is payable upon completion of the merger. In addition, Anthem has agreed to reimburse
Goldman Sachs for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys' fees, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities
under the federal securities laws. 

Opinion of Trigon's Financial AdvisorBear, Stearns & Co. Inc.  

        Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated April 18, 2002, Trigon retained Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. to act as its exclusive financial advisor in
connection with the merger. Trigon's board of directors selected Bear Stearns based on its qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of Trigon's business and affairs. At Trigon's board of
directors meeting on April 27, 2002, Bear Stearns provided an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated April 27, 2002, that, as of that date, and based upon and
subject to the various considerations set forth in the written opinion, the per share merger consideration of $30.00 in cash, without interest, and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock to be paid by
Anthem pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock. 

The written opinion of Bear Stearns, dated April 27, 2002, is attached as Appendix D to this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The opinion sets
forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Bear Stearns in providing its opinion. The written opinion of Bear Stearns is
directed to Trigon's board of directors and addresses

only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the per share merger consideration to be paid by Anthem
pursuant to the merger agreement. The written opinion of Bear Stearns does not address any other aspect of the transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to Trigon's shareholders as to how
to vote at Trigon's shareholder meeting. If you are a Trigon shareholder, you are urged to carefully read the entire opinion in Appendix D.

        Bear
Stearns' opinion does not address the merits of the underlying business decision by Trigon to engage in the merger and related transactions. In addition, Bear Stearns' opinion does
not address the prices at which Trigon Class A common stock and/or Anthem common stock will actually trade at any time and Bear Stearns does not express any recommendation or opinion as to how
the holders of Trigon Class A common stock should vote at Trigon's special meeting. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, Bear Stearns: 


reviewed
a draft copy of the merger agreement, which draft did not materially differ from the executed copy;


reviewed
Trigon's Annual Reports to Shareholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 1999 through
2001, its preliminary results for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 and its Reports on Form 8-K for the three years ended April 27, 2002;


reviewed
certain operating and financial information, including projections for the five years ended December 31, 2006, provided to Bear Stearns by
Trigon's management relating to Trigon's business and prospects; 


reviewed
certain estimates of revenue enhancements, cost savings and other combination benefits (collectively, "Synergies") expected by Trigon and Anthem to
result from the merger, prepared and provided to Bear Stearns jointly by Trigon's management and Anthem's management;


met
with certain members of Trigon's senior management to discuss Trigon's business, operations, historical and projected financial results and future
prospects;


reviewed
Anthem's initial public offering prospectus, dated October 30, 2001;


reviewed
Anthem's Annual Report to Shareholders and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, its
preliminary results for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 and its Reports on Form 8-K between Anthem's initial public offering on November 2, 2001 and April 27,
2002;


reviewed
certain operating and financial information, including projections for the three years ended December 31, 2004, provided to Bear Stearns by
Anthem's management relating to Anthem's business and prospects;


met
with certain members of Anthem's senior management to discuss Anthem's business, operations, historical and projected financial results and future
prospects;


reviewed
the historical prices, trading multiples and trading volumes of the Class A common stock of Trigon and Anthem common stock;


reviewed
publicly available financial data, stock market performance data and trading multiples of companies which Bear Stearns deemed generally comparable
to Trigon and Anthem;


reviewed
the terms of recent mergers and acquisitions of companies which Bear Stearns deemed generally comparable to the merger;


performed
discounted cash flow analyses based on the projections for Trigon, Anthem, the combined company and synergy estimates for the combined company
furnished to Bear Stearns;


reviewed
the pro forma financial results, financial condition and capitalization of the combined company giving effect to the merger; and


conducted
such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Bear Stearns deemed appropriate. 

        Bear
Stearns relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information, including without limitation the projections
and Synergies, provided to Bear Stearns by Trigon and Anthem or otherwise reviewed by Bear Stearns in connection with its engagement. With respect to Trigon and Anthem's projected financial results
and the Synergies that could be achieved upon completion of the merger, Bear Stearns relied on
representations that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the senior managements of Trigon and Anthem as to the expected future
performance of Trigon and Anthem, respectively. Bear Stearns did not assume any responsibility for the independent verification of any such information or of the projections and Synergies provided to
Bear Stearns (or the achievability thereof), and Bear Stearns relied upon the assurances of the senior managements of Trigon and Anthem that they were unaware of any facts that would make the
information, projections and Synergies provided to Bear Stearns incomplete or misleading or which would suggest that such projections and Synergies were not reasonably achievable. 

        In
arriving at its opinion, Bear Stearns did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Trigon and Anthem, nor was Bear
Stearns furnished with any such appraisals. Bear Stearns assumed that the merger would qualify as a tax-free 

"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. In connection with its engagement, pursuant to the instructions of Trigon, Bear Stearns did not solicit
third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part of Trigon. Bear Stearns also assumed that the merger would be consummated in a timely manner and in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement without any limitations, restrictions, conditions, amendments or modifications, regulatory or otherwise, that would have an adverse effect on the parties to the merger
agreement or on Trigon and Anthem on a combined basis or on the contemplated benefits of the merger and Bear Stearns further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory and other consents and
approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without any such adverse effect. 

Presentations to Trigon's Board of Directors  

        On April 23, 2002, Bear Stearns presented to Trigon's board of directors the financial analyses performed by Bear Stearns, as of such date, in connection
with its opinion. At that meeting of the board of directors, Bear Stearns stated that it would be able to give its opinion, barring any unforeseen events, as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the per share merger consideration to be paid to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock based on such analyses. Subsequently, on April 27, 2002, Bear Stearns reviewed with
Trigon's board of directors again the financial analyses performed by Bear Stearns, as updated through the close of business on April 26, 2002, except for the Contribution Analysis and the
Accretion/Dilution Analysis described below, which are as of the close of business on April 25, 2002. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Bear Stearns and
presented to Trigon's board of directors in connection with the rendering of the oral and written opinion of Bear Stearns on April 27, 2002. Bear Stearns prepared the presentations made to
Trigon's board of directors and relied on the analyses included in the presentations in rendering its opinion.

        While
the following summaries describe the material analyses and factors reviewed by Bear Stearns for its opinion, the description is not intended to be a comprehensive description of
all the analyses performed and factors considered by Bear Stearns in arriving at its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of subjective
business judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving
at its opinion, Bear
Stearns considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole. Furthermore, Bear Stearns believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses, would create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying its opinion. In addition, Bear Stearns may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so that the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described below should not be taken to be the views of Bear
Stearns of the actual value of Trigon. 

        Some
of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to understand fully the financial analyses used by Bear Stearns, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. 

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.
    Bear Stearns performed an analysis of the present value of the estimated unlevered,
after-tax free cash flows that Trigon could generate over calendar years 2002 through 2006 based on projections and guidance provided by the management of Trigon. Bear Stearns applied
terminal value multiples ranging from 10x to 12x to Trigon's estimated calendar year 2006 EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) including investment income. The cash
flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value using discount rates ranging from 11% to 15% based on Trigon's weighted average cost of capital. This analysis indicated an implied
equity range per share of Trigon Class A common stock of approximately $81 to $109, as 

compared to the implied value of the merger consideration of $105.08 as of April 26, 2002 (based on Anthem's common stock closing price of $70.70 as of such date). 

        Analysis of Selected Precedent Transactions.
    Bear Stearns reviewed the implied equity values and enterprise values in
selected managed care transactions since 1994. Bear Stearns reviewed equity values as a multiple of last-twelve-month (LTM) net income and enterprise values as multiples of (i) LTM EBITDA and
(ii) LTM revenues. Bear Stearns deemed the WellPoint acquisition of Cerulean, the WellPoint acquisition of RightCHOICE and the WellPoint proposed acquisition of CareFirst as the most relevant
precedents. Bear Stearns then compared the implied multiples derived from these most relevant precedent transactions with corresponding multiples resulting from the implied value as of
April 26, 2002, of the implied merger consideration to be received by Trigon shareholders.

analysis indicated an implied equity range per share of Trigon Class A common stock of approximately $70 to $116, as compared to the implied value of the merger consideration
of $105.08 as of April 26, 2002 (based on Anthem's common stock closing price of $70.70 as of such date). 

        No
transaction used in the analysis of selected precedent transactions is identical to the merger. In evaluating these transactions, Bear Stearns made judgments and assumptions with
regard to industry performance, business, economic, market and financial conditions an other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Trigon. These other matters include the impact of
competition on Trigon, or the companies involved in the precedent transactions and the industries in which they are principally engaged, such industries' growth and the absence of any material adverse
change in the financial condition and prospects of Trigon, or the companies involved in the precedent transactions or the industries in which they are principally engaged or in the financial markets
in general. 

        Takeover-Adjusted Comparable Company Analysis.
    Bear Stearns used public managed care companies and compared certain of their
operating statistics and trading multiples with those of Trigon. These public
comparable companies included companies affiliated with the BCBSA ("Blue Plans"), as well as those that are not Blue Plans serving multiple markets, referred to as the national plans, and companies
serving various regional areas, referred to as the regional plans. 

        Bear
Stearns reviewed equity value as a multiple of 2001 and 2002 net income and enterprise value (calculated as equity value plus debt), as a multiple of (i) 2001 revenues; and
(ii) 2001 and 2002 EBITDA. Bear Stearns then compared the multiples derived from the public comparables to the corresponding multiples of Trigon based on the closing price of April 26,
2002 and for the merger consideration. Financial data for the selected companies and Trigon were based on public filings, company reports, publicly available research analysts' estimates and First
Call estimates.

        Based
on a relevant multiple range, primarily based on Blue Plans, a value range per share of Trigon Class A common stock was estimated, in turn increased by an assumed takeover
premium of 20% to 40%. An implied equity range per Trigon share of approximately $88 to $127 share was obtained, as compared to the implied value of the merger consideration of $105.08 as of
April 26, 2002 (based on Anthem's common stock closing price of $70.70 as of such date). 

        No
company used in the takeover-adjusted comparable company analysis is identical to Trigon. In evaluating the takeover-adjusted comparable company analysis, Bear Stearns made judgments
and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Trigon. These other matters
include the impact of competition on Trigon and the comparable companies and the industries in which they are principally engaged, such industries' growth and the absence of any material adverse
change in the financial condition and prospects of Trigon or the comparable companies or the industries in which they are principally engaged or in the financial markets in general. 

        Premium Paid Analysis.
    Bear Stearns reviewed the premiums paid in 62 selected transactions over $1.0 billion announced
since January 1, 2001. Bear Stearns reviewed the purchase prices paid in the selected transactions relative to the target company's closing stock prices one day prior, 20-day
average prior and 52-week high and low prior to announcement. Bear Stearns then compared the mean and median of premiums implied in the selected transactions over the specified periods
with the premiums implied in the merger for Trigon based on the merger consideration. This analysis indicated the following implied premiums in the selected transactions, as compared to the premium
implied in the merger.

addition, a takeover premium of 20% to 40% was applied to Trigon's stock prices one day prior, 5-day average prior and 20-day average prior to April 26,
2002. An implied equity range per share of Trigon Class A common stock of approximately $92 to $118 was estimated, which compares to the implied value of the merger consideration of $105.08 as
of April 26, 2002 (based on Anthem's common stock closing price of $70.70 as of such date). 

        Present Value of Hypothetical Future Stock Price.
    Based on projected earnings per share for calendar years 2003 and 2004 and
a forward price-to-earnings ratio range of 16x to 19x, a hypothetical future stock price range was estimated. Such hypothetical future stock price range was discounted back at
12% and 15% based on Trigon's cost of equity and an implied value range of approximately $81 to $102 per Trigon share was obtained, which compares to an implied value per share of Trigon
Class A common stock of the merger consideration of $105.08 as of April 26, 2002 (based on Anthem's common stock closing price of $70.70 as of such date). 

        Contribution Analysis.
    Bear Stearns performed a contribution analysis of a variety of different metrics for the Trigon/Anthem
combination. The methodology consisted of certain metrics of Trigon and Anthem on a stand-alone basis as a percentage of the total combined. The selected metrics are: membership, projected revenues,
projected net income, assets, book equity and market capitalization. No adjustments were made for Synergies or consolidation accounting.

        Accretion/Dilution Analysis.
    Bear Stearns analyzed the potential pro forma financial effect of the merger on Anthem's
estimated earnings per share for calendar years 2003, 2004 and 2005. Estimated data for Trigon and Anthem were based on financial projections and estimates of Synergies provided by Trigon's and
Anthem's management. Based on this analysis and assuming the Synergies and the timing of their realization as set forth by management, this model suggested that the merger could be slightly dilutive
in 2003 and accretive thereafter. Trigon's shareholders should note that the actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the variations may be material. 

        In
performing its analyses, Bear Stearns made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of Anthem or Trigon. Any estimates contained in Bear Stearns' analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by the estimates. These analyses were prepared solely as part of the analyses of Bear Stearns of the fairness from a financial point of view of the per share merger
consideration to be paid by Anthem to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock and were conducted in connection with the delivery of the opinion of Bear Stearns to Trigon's board of
directors. 

        The
per share merger consideration to be paid by Anthem and other terms of the merger were determined through arm's-length negotiations between Anthem and Trigon and were approved by
Trigon's board of directors. Bear Stearns provided advice to Trigon during the negotiations; however, Bear Stearns did not recommend any specific merger consideration to Trigon nor give advice that
any given merger consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger. As described above, the opinion of Bear Stearns was among many factors taken into consideration by
Trigon's board of directors in making its decision to adopt the merger agreement and approve the related transactions. Consequently, the analyses of Bear Stearns as described above should not be
viewed as determinative of whether Trigon's board of directors would have been willing to agree to a different amount or form of merger consideration to be paid by Anthem in connection with the
merger. 

Miscellaneous  

        Bear Stearns is an internationally recognized investment banking and advisory firm. Bear Stearns, as part of its investment banking and financial advisory
businesses, is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. 

        In
its opinion, Bear Stearns stated that (1) it previously has been engaged by Trigon to provide certain investment banking and financial advisory services for which Bear Stearns
received customary fees and (2) in the ordinary course of business, Bear Stearns and its affiliates may actively trade the equity and debt securities and/or bank debt of Trigon and/or Anthem
for its own account and for the account of
its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or bank debt. In the past, Bear Stearns has advised Trigon in various strategic assignments. 

        Pursuant
to its engagement letter with Trigon, Bear Stearns provided financial advisory services and financial fairness opinion to Trigon's board of directors in connection with the
merger and Trigon agreed to pay a customary fee to Bear Stearns in respect of the services provided. A substantial portion of this fee is contingent on the completion of the merger. Trigon has also
agreed to reimburse Bear Stearns for its expenses incurred in performing its services. In addition, Trigon has agreed to indemnify Bear Stearns and its affiliates, directors, officers, agent and
employees and each person, if any, controlling Bear Stearns or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, related
to or arising out of the engagement of Bear Stearns. 

Board of Directors and Management of Anthem Following the Merger  

        Board of Directors of Anthem.
    Upon completion of the merger, three current, non-employee directors of Trigon will
be appointed to the board of directors of Anthem. The appointment of the Trigon directors to the Anthem board will be structured in such a way that one Trigon director's term of office will expire at
Anthem's annual meeting in 2003, another Trigon director's term of office will expire in 2004 and the third Trigon director's term of office will expire in 2005. Anthem and Trigon currently intend
that each of these Trigon directors appointed to the Anthem board be nominated for election at the expiration of his or her term. 

        Upon
completion of the merger, Thomas G. Snead, Jr., the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Trigon, will be named President of the Southeast Region for Anthem. The headquarters and
principal executive offices of Anthem's Southeast Region will be located in Richmond, Virginia. As President, Mr. Snead will be responsible for Anthem's health benefits operations in that
region and will report directly to the Chief Executive Officer of Anthem. Additionally, Thomas R. Byrd, currently a Senior Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer of Trigon, will serve in
various financial and other management roles for Anthem's Southeast Region. 

        In connection with the merger agreement, Anthem and Trigon have entered into employment agreements and noncompetition agreements with Messrs. Snead and Byrd, which will take
effect at the completion of the merger. Mr. Snead's employment agreement has a term of three years and Mr. Byrd's employment agreement and each of Mr. Snead's and
Mr. Byrd's noncompetition agreements have a term of two years.

        Additional
executive officers of Trigon will hold positions with Anthem after the merger. 

        Information
about the current Anthem directors and executive officers can be found on page 139 of this document under the section entitled "ANTHEM'S MANAGEMENT". Information about
the current Trigon directors and executive officers can be found in Trigon's proxy statement, which is incorporated by reference into Trigon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 

2001. Trigon's Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" on page 186.

        For
more information see "THE MERGERInterests of Trigon's Directors and Officers in the Merger that Differ From Your Interests" on page 68. 

Distribution of the Merger Consideration  

        At or prior to the completion of the merger, Anthem will cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company acting as exchange agent, the cash portion of the
merger consideration, certificates representing shares of Anthem common stock to be issued in the merger and cash in lieu of any fractional shares that would otherwise be issued in the merger. 

        Promptly
after the completion of the merger, Anthem will cause the exchange agent to send a letter of transmittal and instructions to each holder of a Trigon stock certificate for use in
exchanging Trigon Class A common stock certificates for cash, without interest, certificates representing shares of Anthem common stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable, and
any dividend or other distribution with respect to Anthem common stock with a record date after completion of the merger and before such certificates are delivered to the exchange agent. Holders of
Trigon stock certificates should 
NOT
 surrender their Trigon stock certificates for exchange until they receive the letter of transmittal and
instructions. The exchange agent will deliver cash, certificates for Anthem common stock and/or a check instead of any fractional shares of Anthem common stock once it receives the properly completed
transmittal materials together with certificates representing a holder's shares of Trigon Class A common stock. 

        Trigon
stock certificates may be delivered to the exchange agent for the merger consideration for up to one year after the completion of the merger. At the end of that period, any Anthem
stock certificates and cash will be returned to Anthem. Any holders of Trigon stock certificates who have not by that time exchanged their certificates will be entitled to look to Anthem and the
surviving corporation for cash, Anthem stock certificates and any cash to be received instead of fractional shares of Anthem common stock. Neither Anthem, Trigon nor AI Sub Acquisition Corp. or the
exchange agent will be liable to any person in the event that any merger consideration is delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

        If
your Trigon stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed you may receive cash and an Anthem stock certificate upon the making of an affidavit of that fact. Anthem may require
you to post a bond in a reasonable amount as an indemnity against any claim that may be made against Anthem with respect to the lost, stolen or destroyed Trigon stock certificate. 

        After
completion of the merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of Trigon and any certificates presented to the exchange agent or Anthem for any reason
will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. 

Public Trading Markets  

        Anthem common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ATH." Trigon Class A common stock is currently listed on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TGH." Upon completion of the merger, Trigon Class A common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The newly issued Anthem common stock issuable pursuant to the merger agreement will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 

        The
shares of Anthem common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be freely transferable under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except for shares issued to any
shareholder 

who may be deemed to be an affiliate of Trigon, as discussed in "THE MERGERResales of Anthem Stock by Affiliates" on page 68. 

        As reported on the New York Stock Exchange, the closing sale price per share of Anthem common stock on April 26, 2002, the last business day prior to the date of the merger
agreement, was $70.70, and the closing sale price per share of Trigon Class A common stock on April 26, 2002 was $84.25. Based on the closing sale price per share of Anthem common stock,
the implied value to be paid in the merger for each share of Trigon Class A common stock was $105.08 as of that date. The closing sale price per share of Anthem common stock on June 6,
2002, the last practicable trading day before the date of this document, was $70.45 and the closing sale price per share of Trigon Class A common stock on June 6, 2002 was $104.70. Based
on the closing sale price per share of Anthem common stock, the implied value to be paid in the merger for each share of Trigon Class A common stock was $104.82 as of that date. The implied
value to be paid in the merger for each share of Trigon Class A common stock as of these dates was calculated by multiplying Anthem's closing sale price per share by 1.062, and adding the $30
per share cash component of the merger consideration. Because the stock price of both of our companies will fluctuate, you should obtain current quotations of these prices.

Repurchases of Common Stock  

        Anthem has previously announced a common stock repurchase program under which it is authorized to acquire up to $400 million of its common stock in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

        Regulation M
under the federal securities laws prohibits Anthem from bidding for or repurchasing its common stock during: 


the
period commencing with the mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus through the date of the Trigon shareholders' meeting; and


the
20-trading-day period during which the Average Anthem Price is determined. See "THE MERGER AGREEMENTTrigon's Additional Right of Termination
Related to Anthem's Stock Price" on page 84.

        Subject
to applicable law, Anthem may from time to time repurchase shares of Anthem common stock and Trigon may from time to time repurchase shares of Trigon Class A common stock.
During the course of the solicitation being made by this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Anthem may, subject to applicable law, be bidding for and purchasing shares of Trigon Class A common
stock. 

Anthem Dividends  

        Anthem does not currently pay dividends on shares of its common stock. Anthem shareholders, including Trigon shareholders who receive shares of Anthem common
stock in the merger and hold such stock as of the relevant record date, will be entitled to receive dividends only when and if declared by Anthem's board of directors out of funds legally available
for dividends. 

Absence of Dissenters' Rights  

        Dissenters' rights are statutory rights that enable shareholders who object to extraordinary transactions, such as mergers, to demand that the corporation pay the
fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding, instead of receiving the consideration offered to shareholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction.
Dissenters' rights are not available in all circumstances, and exceptions to such rights are set forth in the laws of Indiana and Virginia, the states of incorporation of Anthem and Trigon,
respectively. These exceptions are applicable with respect to the rights of Anthem shareholders and Trigon shareholders in the merger. 

        Anthem
shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights under Indiana law in connection with the merger because Anthem shareholders are not required to approve the merger. Trigon
shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights under Virginia law because the shares of Trigon Class A common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, a national securities
exchange, Trigon shareholders are receiving only cash and Anthem common stock, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, as consideration in the merger, and the merger is not an "Affiliated
Transaction," as defined under Virginia law. 

Resales of Anthem Stock by Affiliates  

        Affiliates of Trigon, as defined under Rule 145 under the Securities Act, generally may not sell their shares of Anthem common stock acquired in the merger
except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including Rules 144 and 145
issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act. Affiliates include directors, executive officers, and beneficial owners of 10% or more of any class of capital stock. 

        Under
the merger agreement, Trigon has provided Anthem with a list of the persons who, to Trigon's knowledge, may be deemed to be affiliates of Trigon as of the date of the Trigon
special meeting. Trigon will also deliver to Anthem a letter agreement executed by each of these persons by which that person will agree, among other things, not to offer to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of the shares of Anthem common stock distributed to him or her pursuant to the merger except in compliance with Rules 144 and Rule 145 under the Securities Act,
in a transaction that, in the opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Anthem, is otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, or in an offering registered under the
Securities Act. Anthem may place restrictive legends on its common stock certificates that are issued to persons who are deemed to be affiliates of Trigon under the Securities Act. 

        This
document does not cover any resales of Anthem common stock received in the merger by any person who may be deemed an affiliate of Trigon. 

Interests of Trigon's Directors and Officers in the Merger that Differ from Your Interests  

        Trigon's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger as individuals in addition to, and that may be different from, their interests as
shareholders. Each of the Anthem board of directors and
the Trigon board of directors was aware of these interests of Trigon directors and executive officers and considered them in its decision to adopt the merger agreement. 

Agreements with Executive Officers  

        Trigon maintains Executive Continuity Agreements with certain executive officers. As described below, the Executive Continuity Agreements provide the executive
officers benefits in connection with a change in control of Trigon. Anthem and Trigon have entered into new employment agreements and non-competition agreements with each of Thomas G.
Snead, Jr. and Thomas R. Byrd, that upon completion of the merger will replace and supersede their existing employment arrangements, including their Executive Continuity Agreements. Anthem has also
entered into executive agreements and non-competition agreements with each of William P. Bracciodieta, John J. Brighton, Kathy A. Merry, Paul F. Nezi, Peter L. Perkins and David P. Wade,
that upon completion of the merger will replace and supersede all their existing employment arrangements, including their Executive Continuity Agreements. Trigon has amended its employment agreement
with Ronald M. Nash to provide that if his employment is terminated prior to December 31, 2002, he will be treated as if he had retired on December 31, 2002, and to provide that he will
not be entitled to benefits under his Executive Continuity Agreement. The amendment also provides him with the maximum annual and long-term

incentive awards under Trigon's incentive plans for the 2002 calendar year upon retirement. As a consequence, only the Executive Continuity Agreements with the following Trigon executive officers,
James W. Copley, Jr., John W. Coyle, Timothy P. Nolan, Thomas W. Payne and J. Christopher Wiltshire, and two other Trigon employees, will be effective following the merger. 

        Executive Continuity Agreements.
    The Executive Continuity Agreements provide that if the executive's employment is terminated
without "cause" or for "good reason" within a specified number of years after a change in control of Trigon (a "compensable termination"), the executive will be entitled to receive a cash lump sum
severance payment equal to a specified severance multiple times the greater of (1) the executive's highest annual compensation during the three years preceding the change in control (including
base salary, annual and long-term incentives, and equity awards other than options) or (2) 155% of the executive's base salary for the year of termination. The number of years
following a change in control in which a compensable termination must occur and the severance multiple is three for Messrs. Copley, Coyle, Payne, and Wiltshire, and two for Mr. Nolan. In
addition to the severance payment, upon a compensable termination, each of the executives would be entitled to health benefits for a number of years equal to the severance multiple (with such years
being credited for purposes of determining eligibility under Trigon's retiree welfare plan) and to a lump sum payout under Trigon's supplemental executive retirement plan (taking into account an
additional five years age and service, in the case of Messrs. Copley, Coyle and Payne). For the year in which a change in control of Trigon occurs, the executive is entitled to receive an
annual and long-term bonus equal to the greater of his annual and long-term bonus targets or his annual and long-term bonuses determined based on actual performance for the year (and a pro rata
portion of such bonuses if terminated in the year of the change in control), as well as vesting of all outstanding stock options. In addition, if the executive is subject to federal excise tax on
"excess parachute payments," he will be made whole for that tax by Trigon. Approval of the merger agreement by Trigon's shareholders is treated as a change in control under the Executive Continuity
Agreements.

        Messrs. Copley, Coyle, Nolan, Payne and Wiltshire have received from Anthem and Trigon acknowledgment that a voluntary termination of their employment after the merger will
constitute a compensable termination within the meaning of their Executive Continuity Agreements. The total aggregate cash severance payable to these five executive officers for a compensable
termination would be approximately $10.6 million. In addition, the merger will constitute a compensable termination for two other Trigon employees.

        New Employment Agreements with Messrs. Snead and Byrd.
    Anthem has entered into new employment agreements with
Messrs. Snead and Byrd, that upon completion of the merger will replace and supersede their existing employment arrangements, including their Executive Continuity Agreements. The new employment
agreements are substantially the same as agreements Anthem has entered into with its own similarly situated executives and have a term of three years, in the case of Mr. Snead, and two years,
in the case of Mr. Byrd. Mr. Snead has agreed to transition to the Anthem compensation structure, beginning in 2003, which includes a reduction in base salary. Mr. Byrd has agreed
to transition to the Anthem compensation structure by 2004, which will include a reduction in base salary. The new employment agreements also provide that Mr. Snead and Mr. Byrd will
have the opportunity to participate in Anthem's 2001 management and key associate stock incentive program on a level consistent with similarly situated executives, which in 2003 consists of grants of
options to purchase shares of Anthem common stock (40,000, in the case of Mr. Snead, and 10,000, in the case of Mr. Byrd).

        Under the new employment agreement, upon a termination of employment without "cause" or for "good reason," Mr. Snead will be entitled to receive: base salary through the remainder
of the term of employment; vesting of long-term incentive awards; pro rated annual and long-term incentive awards for the year of termination (based upon actual performance, or, in the year of the
merger, target performance, if greater); 80% of his annual and long-term incentive opportunity had he remained

employed for the remainder of the term (100% if he agrees to provide certain consulting services); a payment of $768,503 with respect to his supplemental pension with Trigon; and medical and dental
benefits for the remainder of the term. In addition, if Mr. Snead is subject to federal excise tax on "excess parachute payments" for any payments he receives, he will be made whole for that
tax by Anthem. Under the new employment agreement, upon a termination of Mr. Byrd's employment without "cause," Mr. Byrd will be entitled to receive for the greater of one year or the
remainder of the term: base salary; vesting of long-term incentive awards; pro rated annual and long-term incentive awards for the year of termination (based upon actual performance, or, in the year
of the merger, target performance, if greater); 50% of his annual and long-term incentive opportunity had he remained employed for the remainder of the term; and medical and dental benefits. In
addition, if Mr. Byrd is subject to federal excise tax on "excess parachute payments" for any payments made in connection with the merger or pursuant to the non-competition
agreement (but not for payments made solely under the new employment agreement), he will be made whole for that tax by Anthem.

        Executive Severance Agreements with Other Executive Officers.
    On May 15, 2002, Anthem entered into executive
agreements and non-competition agreements with Messrs. Nezi, Perkins, Brighton, Bracciodieta and Wade, and Ms. Merry, whom we refer to as the "Continuing Executives," which
upon completion of the merger replace and supersede their existing employment arrangements, including their Executive

Continuity Agreements. The executive agreements are substantially the same as agreements Anthem has entered into with its own similarly situated executives and provide severance payments upon
termination of employment without "cause." The Continuing Executives have agreed to transition to the Anthem compensation structure by January 1, 2004, which includes a reduction in base
salary. The new executive agreements also provide that the Continuing Executives will have the opportunity to participate in Anthem's 2001 management and key associate stock incentive program on a
level consistent with similarly situated executives, which includes a specified grant of options in 2003. Upon a termination of employment without "cause," each of the Continuing Executives will be
entitled to receive one year of base salary and benefits, and a pro rated target annual award (but not less than half of the target award). In addition, if any Continuing Executive is subject to
federal exercise tax on "excess parachute payments" for any payment made in connection with the merger or pursuant to the non-competition agreement (but not for payments made solely under
the executive non-severance agreement) he or she will be made whole for that tax by Anthem.

        Non-competition Agreements.
    Prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Anthem also entered into
non-competition agreements with Mr. Snead, Mr. Byrd and the Continuing Executives, pursuant to which these executive officers agreed not to compete with Anthem for a period
of 26 months from the date of the merger in exchange for a cash payment. The cash payment will be made in three equal annual installments, commencing 60 days after the merger.
Twenty-five percent of an executive officer's cash payment is subject to forfeiture if the executive officer violates the non-competition agreement. In addition to the
non-competition restriction, these executive officers have agreed to be bound by non-solicitation restrictions. The maximum amount of non-competition payments that could be
made to these executive officers under the non-competition agreements is approximately $15.9 million.

Equity Awards

        Generally, Trigon options and restricted stock will vest upon approval of the merger agreement by Trigon shareholders, and all options that are unexercised at the
time of the merger will be converted into vested options to purchase Anthem common stock in the merger. See "THE MERGER AGREEMENTTreatment of Trigon Stock Options and Restricted Stock" on
page 87. However, each of Messrs. Snead, Byrd and the Continuing Executives has agreed to waive vesting of their stock options until completion of the merger. Based on the market price of
Anthem common stock on June 6, 2002, the last practicable trading day before the distribution of this document, the aggregate

in-the-money value of Trigon options held by Trigon directors and executive officers that will vest in connection with the merger is $28,685,791 and the number of restricted
shares of Trigon Class A common stock held by Trigon directors and executive officers that will vest upon approval of the merger agreement by Trigon shareholders is approximately 42,013.

Insurance and Indemnification  

        The merger agreement provides that, following the merger, Anthem will ensure that AI Sub Acquisition Corp. will indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of Trigon and its subsidiaries to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses under Trigon's articles of incorporation and bylaws as of the date of the merger agreement for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the merger. Anthem will also ensure that AI Sub
Acquisition Corp. will purchase as of the completion of the merger a tail policy to the current Trigon policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance,
providing for substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and containing terms and conditions no less advantageous in the aggregate than, the current policy, which tail policy will be effective
for a period from the closing of the merger through and including the date six years after the closing date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the closing
of the merger. In no event, however, will AI Sub Acquisition Corp. be required to expend an amount for such tail policy in excess of 400% of the annual premium currently paid by Trigon for its current
policy of directors and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. If the premium for such insurance exceeds that amount, then AI Sub Acquisition Corp. must purchase a tail
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

        In
addition, to the extent permitted by the IBCL and for a period of six years following completion of the merger, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of AI Sub Acquisition Corp.
will contain provisions concerning indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability at least as favorable as those set forth in Trigon's existing articles of incorporation and
bylaws and, in the event any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is made on or prior to the end of such six-year period, such provisions will continue in effect until the
final resolution of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

Merger Financing  

        Anthem will have cash requirements of approximately $1.2 billion for the merger, including both the cash portion of the purchase price and transaction
costs. Anthem has entered into a bridge loan agreement under which it may borrow up to $1.2 billion. The bridge loan agreement contains various conditions to Anthem's ability to borrow under
the bridge loan, including conditions related to (1) the absence of any material adverse change since December 31, 2001 in the business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or
operations of Anthem or in Anthem's ability to repay the bridge loan, (2) the absence of any new litigation or legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on Anthem as described
in (1) above, (3) Anthem's failure to comply with the financial covenants and ratios set forth in the bridge loan agreement, and (4) the requirement that Anthem and its
unregulated subsidiaries (after giving effect to the merger) must have cash or cash equivalents on hand of at least $300 million at the time of the merger.

        Interest under the bridge loan will be payable periodically at a floating rate equal, at Anthem's option, to either the "Base Rate" (essentially, the higher of a commercial "prime rate"
or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%) or the "reserve adjusted Eurodollar Rate" plus 1.05%. All indebtedness under the

bridge loan must be repaid in full no later than January 28, 2003, and a prepayment in the amount of $300 million must be made no later than one month after the completion of the merger.

        Anthem intends to obtain permanent or long-term financing for part of the cash portion of the merger consideration through a combination of (1) borrowings under an
amended and restated version of Anthem's existing $800 million credit facility and (2) the issuance of long-term debt securities. The ultimate mix of bank debt and
long-term debt securities will be determined based on market conditions and other financial factors. Anthem is currently working with its lender group to amend and restate its existing
$800 million credit facility. As amended and restated, it is expected that the credit facility would provide for Anthem to be the primary borrower and that the facility would provide for up to
$1.0 billion of available borrowings.

        Borrowings under (or the availability of borrowings under) the amended and restated credit facility and the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt securities would
reduce the amount of the loan commitment under the bridge loan. To the extent that indebtedness under the bridge loan agreement has been incurred, borrowings under the amended and restated credit
facility and/or the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt securities would be used to repay indebtedness under the bridge loan.

        Anthem
has represented to Trigon in the merger agreement that it will have available to it, at the time the merger is completed, sufficient funds to enable Anthem to complete the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The availability of such funds is not a condition to Anthem's obligation to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

The following describes certain aspects of the proposed merger, including material provisions of the merger agreement. The following
description of the merger agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to this document and is incorporated by
reference into this document. We urge you to read the entire merger agreement carefully.

Terms of the Merger  

        The merger agreement contemplates the merger of Trigon with and into AI Sub Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem, with AI Sub Acquisition
Corp. continuing as the surviving corporation. Anthem intends to change the name of the surviving corporation to "Anthem Southeast, Inc." promptly after the merger. The merger agreement
provides that each share of Trigon Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger will be canceled and converted into, subject to adjustment as
set forth in the merger agreement, the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest, and 1.062 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Anthem common stock. All shares of Trigon Class A
common stock that are owned by Trigon as treasury stock, and all shares of Trigon Class A common stock owned by Anthem or AI Sub Acquisition Corp., will be canceled and retired and will cease
to exist without consideration of any kind being paid for them. 

Manner and Basis of Converting Shares; Procedure; No Fractional Shares; Effect on Certificates  

        Within five business days after completion of the merger, transmittal letters and exchange instructions will be mailed to each holder of Trigon Class A
common stock to be used to surrender and exchange certificates formerly evidencing shares of Trigon Class A common stock. After receiving the transmittal letters and instructions, each holder
of certificates formerly representing Trigon Class A common stock will be able to surrender such certificates to the exchange agent appointed by Anthem, and, in exchange, each such holder will
receive the cash to which such holder is entitled, certificates evidencing the number of whole shares of Anthem common stock to which such holder is entitled, any cash which may be payable in lieu of
a fractional share of Anthem common stock, and any dividend or other distribution with respect to Anthem common stock with a record date after completion of the merger and before such certificates are
delivered to the exchange agent. 
Trigon shareholders should not send in their certificates until they receive their transmittal letters and
instructions.

        After
the merger is completed, each certificate formerly representing Trigon Class A common stock, until so surrendered and exchanged, will evidence only the right to receive the
cash and the number of whole shares of Anthem common stock that the holder is entitled to receive in the merger, any cash payment in lieu of a fractional share of Anthem common stock and any dividend
or other distribution with respect to Anthem common stock with a record date after completion of the merger and before such certificates are delivered to the exchange agent. The holder of such an
unexchanged certificate will not be entitled to receive any dividends or distributions payable by Anthem until the certificate has been exchanged. Subject to applicable laws, following surrender of
such certificates, such dividends and distributions, together with any cash payment in lieu of a fractional share of Anthem common stock, will be paid without interest. 

        Anthem
will not issue any fractional shares of Anthem common stock in the merger. Instead, a Trigon shareholder who otherwise would have received a fraction of a share of Anthem common
stock will receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying the fractional share by the closing price for a share of Anthem common stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, on the day that
the merger is completed, or, if such a day is not a trading day, on the trading day immediately preceding the completion of the merger. 

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger  

        Closing.
    Unless the parties agree otherwise, the closing of the merger will take place on the second business day after the
date on which all closing conditions have been satisfied or waived (other than any conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the closing date) or such other time as agreed to in
writing by Anthem and Trigon. We currently expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2002. 

        Effective Time.
    The merger will be effective upon the last filing of Articles of Merger with the Secretary of the
Commonwealth of Virginia and State of Indiana or at such later time as Anthem and Trigon specify in the Articles of Merger. Such filings of Articles of Merger will be made simultaneously with the
closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 

Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements

        The
merger agreement also contains additional representations and warranties of Anthem relating to:

        "Material
Adverse Effect" means, with respect to Anthem or Trigon, as the case may be, 

(1)
any
effect that is materially adverse to the business, assets, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Anthem and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Trigon and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, respectively, other than any effect relating to

(A)
the
United States or global economy or securities markets in general;

(B)
the
announcement of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by it or the identity of Anthem;

(C)
changes
in applicable law or regulations or in generally accepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting principles; or

(D)
general
changes in the health benefits business; 

provided,
that with respect to each of clauses (A), (C) and (D) that such effect is not materially more adverse with respect to Trigon and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Anthem
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, than the effect on comparable health benefits businesses generally, 
and

(2)
any
effect that materially impairs, materially delays or prevents completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. 

No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions  

        The merger agreement provides that during its term, Trigon will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries' directors,
officers, employees, agents or representatives, to directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate, or provide or disclose non-public information in furtherance of, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction, as defined below, or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions with any third party with respect to an
Alternative Transaction, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or the Trigon stock option agreement. 

        Despite
this general prohibition on soliciting, encouraging, negotiating or engaging in discussions with respect to an Alternative Transaction, Trigon may, at any time prior to approval
of the merger agreement by Trigon shareholders, provide information to, negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, any third party that delivers an unsolicited bona fide written proposal for
an Alternative Transaction if the Trigon board of directors determines in good faith: 


after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to provide such information or to engage in such negotiations or discussions is or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties under Virginia law; and


that
the proposal is a "Superior Proposal," as defined below. 

        Trigon
has also agreed that, prior to providing any information or data to, or entering into any negotiations or discussions with, any such third party, it will: 


give
Anthem five business days' prior written notice of Trigon's intention to provide such information or data or enter into such negotiations or
discussions, and during that five-day period, if requested by Anthem, engage in good faith negotiations to amend the merger agreement such that the board of directors of Trigon will not be
required to provide such information pursuant to its fiduciary duties; and


receive
from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms and provisions at least as restrictive as contained in the
confidentiality agreement executed with Anthem. 

        Trigon
has agreed to notify Anthem promptly of any such inquiry, proposal or offer or discussion or negotiations and to provide Anthem with the name of the person making the unsolicited
bona fide written proposal for an Alternative Transaction; in addition, Trigon has agreed to provide Anthem with a copy of any such written proposal or offer. Trigon has also agreed to keep Anthem
informed on a prompt basis, regarding the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, and that it will deliver to Anthem copies of (or, if
oral, summaries of) any changes to any proposals or offers. 

        Additionally,
Trigon has agreed that it will not take any actions during the term of the merger agreement to exempt a third party from Trigon's rights agreement, the threshold
restrictions on common stock ownership contained in Trigon's articles of incorporation, or make any Virginia state takeover statute or similar statute inapplicable to any Alternative Transaction,
unless Trigon's board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such actions would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the directors' fiduciary duties under Virginia law. 

        "Alternative
Transaction" means any of the following events: 

(1)
the
acquisition of Trigon by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
(these transactions are referred to in this section as "business combination transactions") by a party other than Anthem, AI Sub Acquisition Corp. or any of their affiliates;

(2)
Trigon's
acquisition of a third party in a business combination transaction in which the shareholders of the third party immediately prior to completion of such business combination
transaction will own more than 50% of Trigon's outstanding capital stock immediately following such transaction; or

(3)
the
acquisition by a third party of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Trigon Class A common stock or of 20% or more of the assets of Trigon and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions. 

        "Superior
Proposal" means a bona fide written proposal made by a person other than Anthem, AI Sub Acquisition Corp. or one of their affiliates, 

(1)
which
is for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving, or any purchase or acquisition of,

(A)
more
than 50% of the voting power of Trigon's capital stock; or

(B)
all
or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Trigon and its subsidiaries; and 

(2)
which
is otherwise on terms which Trigon's board of directors determines, in good faith, 

(A)
would
result in a transaction that, if consummated, is more favorable to Trigon's shareholders, from a long-term financial point of view, than the merger with Anthem or,
if applicable, any proposal by Anthem to amend the terms of the merger agreement, (based on the written advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm) taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and the merger agreement and the relative impact of the merger with Anthem and such other proposed transaction on the other persons whose interests the board of directors
of Trigon may consider under Virginia law (to the extent they may do so), and

(B)
is
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; 

provided,
however, that no proposal will be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any financing required to consummate the proposal is not committed. 

Expenses and Fees  

        In general, each party will be responsible for all expenses incurred by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. However,
Anthem and Trigon will each pay one-half of the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, if Trigon
withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation of the merger, Anthem will not be responsible for any costs or expenses associated with the delivery of any materials to Trigon's shareholders
reflecting such change.

Additional Covenants  

Board Recommendations
. Anthem has agreed that its board of directors will recommend approval of the stock issuance
to its shareholders, include its recommendation in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such approval, and will not withhold, withdraw or
modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to Trigon, or announce publicly its intention to do so, except for factual disclosure relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement if
advisable under applicable law. Trigon has agreed that its board of directors will recommend approval of the merger agreement, include its recommendation in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain shareholder approval. 

        If, prior to approval of the merger by Trigon's shareholders, Trigon's board of directors receives a "superior proposal" and determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to consider the proposal would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under Virginia law, the board may withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Anthem its recommendation, provided that, prior to the taking of such action, Trigon has given Anthem five business days' prior written notice and engaged in good faith negotiations with
Anthem to amend the merger agreement so that Trigon's board of directors can continue to recommend the approval of the merger agreement, and subject to Anthem's right to terminate the merger agreement
as described under "THE MERGER AGREEMENTTermination" on page 83 and "THE MERGER AGREEMENTTermination Fees" on page 86. Trigon has agreed that, even if its board
of directors withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation, it will not change its adoption of the merger agreement or any other board approval that would have the effect of causing the stock
ownership restrictions in Trigon's articles of incorporation and rights agreement or any Virginia takeover statute or similar statute to be applicable to the merger, or change its obligation to submit
the merger agreement to its shareholder for approval. Trigon may disclose to its shareholders its position with respect to a tender offer or that a proposal for an "Alternative Transaction" has been
made and the material terms of such proposal, if such disclosure is advisable under applicable law.

        Transition Team.
    In accordance with the merger agreement, we have established a transition planning team comprised of an
equal number of representatives of Anthem and Trigon to facilitate a transition

and integration planning process in order to ensure the successful combination of the operations of Trigon with those of Anthem following completion of the merger. The transition team is responsible
for developing, and monitoring the development of, and deliverables due under, an action plan for the combination of the businesses following completion of the merger and will meet regularly to review
the financial performance of Trigon and its affiliates. At those meetings, Trigon also will advise the transition team on its compliance with any operating plan previously presented to Anthem.

        Employee Benefit Matters.
    Until December 31, 2003, Anthem has agreed to provide current and former employees of Trigon
and its subsidiaries with compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits provided prior to the merger. After December 31, 2003, Anthem
will provide compensation and benefits to such individuals that are comparable in the aggregate to those it provides to its similarly situated employees. In addition, Anthem has agreed to provide such
employees with service credit for certain purposes under its plans and to waive pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements under its benefits plans.

        Anthem has agreed to honor Trigon's benefit plans, and has specifically agreed to continue Trigon's Retirement Program without modification through December 31, 2003 (and to
continue the final average pay component of the program until October 1, 2003). Anthem has agreed to continue Trigon's annual and long-term incentive plans until December 31, 2003,
except that,

(1)
with
the consent of Thomas G. Snead, Jr., which will not be unreasonably withheld, performance measures may be adjusted to reflect the merger; 

(2)
target
bonus percentages must be maintained throughout such period; and

(3)
performance
in respect of 2002 and 2003 will not take in account expenses or charges related to the merger. 

        Trigon
employees will be entitled to participate in the Anthem employee stock purchase plan as soon as possible after completion of the merger. 

        If
after the merger Anthem disposes of any of its subsidiaries including the surviving corporation or all or substantially all of their respective assets prior to December 31,
2003, it has promised to require the purchaser of the surviving corporation, its subsidiaries or their respective assets, as the case may be, to
expressly agree to assume and perform its obligations under the merger agreement with respect to compensation and benefits through December 31, 2003. 

        Trigon's Commercial Paper and Cash Requirements.
    Trigon has agreed that it will, in accordance with prudent business
practices 

(1)
use
commercially reasonable efforts to meet the goal of repurchasing, prior to the completion of the merger, all of its outstanding commercial paper for cash; and

(2)
pursue
as a goal the existence of cash and/or cash equivalents at the time of completion of the merger, in an amount in the aggregate that is consistent with the disclosures made to
rating agencies prior to the signing of the merger agreement in connection with the merger. 

        Anthem
and Trigon have acknowledged that unexpected contingencies or facts may arise such that Trigon may, in its reasonable judgement, vary from the obligations above, provided that it
consult and cooperate with Anthem in good faith prior to any such variance. 

Termination  

        The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the closing date, before or after the requisite approval of the Anthem and Trigon shareholders has
been received: 


by
the mutual written consent of Trigon and Anthem;


by
either Anthem or Trigon, if the merger has not been completed on or before January 28, 2003 (other than due principally to the failure of the
terminating party to perform its obligations under the merger agreement);


by
Anthem, if the board of directors of Trigon withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation of the merger agreement to Trigon's shareholders in a manner
adverse to Anthem;


by
Anthem, if the Trigon board of directors adopts or recommends any Alternative Transaction;

Anthem or Trigon, if Anthem's shareholders fail to approve the issuance of shares of Anthem common stock in the merger;

Anthem or Trigon, if any court or other governmental body of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable order or taken any, final and
non-appealable action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger;


by
Trigon, if there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Anthem or AI Sub Acquisition Corp.
which breach would permit Trigon to not complete the merger and which breach is not cured within 45 days of notice of such breach or by the closing date, if sooner, or any of the conditions to
both parties' obligations 

(see
"THE MERGER AGREEMENTConditions to Completion of the Merger" on page 77) have become incapable of fulfillment;


by
Anthem, if there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Trigon which breach would permit
Anthem to not complete the merger and which breach is not cured within 45 days of notice of such breach or by the closing date, if sooner, or any of the conditions to both parties' obligations
(see "THE MERGER AGREEMENTConditions to Completion of the Merger" on page 77) have become incapable of fulfillment; or


by
Trigon, under the circumstances described below under "Trigon's Additional Right of Termination Related to Anthem's Stock Price." 

Trigon's Additional Right of Termination Related to Anthem's Stock Price  

        Trigon has the right to terminate the merger agreement if the market price of Anthem common stock decreases significantly, and significantly underperforms an
agreed index of health benefit companies, from April 26, 2002 through the time we are otherwise ready to complete the merger. 

        Trigon
must exercise this termination right within a period of five business days following the "determination date" (as defined below) if, on the determination date, both of the
following two conditions are satisfied: 

(1)
the
Average Anthem Price (as defined below) is less than $55; and

(2)
the
number obtained by dividing the Average Anthem Price by $70.70 (which was the closing price of Anthem common stock on April 26, 2002) is less
than the number obtained by dividing the Index Price (as defined below) on the determination date by $73.40 (which was the Index Price on April 26, 2002) and subtracting 0.15 from the quotient. 

        However,
if Trigon elects to terminate the merger agreement under such circumstances, Anthem will have the right, but not the obligation, to prevent the merger agreement from being
terminated by increasing the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of Trigon Class A common stock in the merger. 

        Specifically,
if Anthem exercises that right, it will be able to elect among the three options discussed below. For the purposes of the following examples, it is assumed: 


that
the Average Anthem Price is $50.00; and


that
the condition set forth in clause (2) above has been satisfied. 

        1.    Anthem
may elect to continue to pay $30.00 per share of Trigon Class A common stock, without interest, and increase the number of shares of Anthem common stock to
be exchanged for each outstanding share of Trigon Class A common stock to a number equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth and subject to adjustment) of: 

$58.41
 Average Anthem Price

Example: If Anthem makes the foregoing election, each share of Trigon Class A common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $30.00
in cash, without interest, and 1.1682 shares of Anthem common stock.

        2.    Anthem
may elect to continue to issue 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock per share of Trigon Class A common stock and increase the amount of cash to be paid for
each outstanding share of Trigon Class A common stock by the cash value (based on the Average Anthem Price) of the 

positive difference between 1.062 and the number of shares that Anthem would have issued if it had made the election in paragraph 1 above. The value of the increase is referred to in this
document as the "Top-Up Amount." 

Example: If Anthem makes the foregoing election, each share of Trigon Class A common stock will be canceled and converted into the right to receive $35.31
in cash, without interest, and 1.062 shares of Anthem common stock. The increase of $5.31 in the cash consideration is determined by subtracting 1.062 from 1.1682 and multiplying that difference by
the assumed Average Anthem Price of $50.00.

        3.    Anthem
may elect to both increase the cash portion of the merger consideration and adjust the exchange ratio as Anthem may determine, so long as the sum of the value of
such adjustments equals the Top-Up Amount. The value of any increase in the number of shares of Anthem common stock to be issued for each share of Trigon Class A common stock will
be determined based on the Average Anthem Price. 

Example: If Anthem makes an election in the foregoing manner, Anthem could elect to cancel and convert each share of Trigon Class A common stock into, for
example, $33.00 in cash, without interest, and 1.1082 shares of Anthem common stock.

        Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Anthem will not be entitled to elect to increase the cash portion of the merger consideration as explained in paragraphs 2 or 3 above unless Anthem and
Trigon agree (each acting reasonably and in good faith) that the transaction, as adjusted, qualifies as a tax-free "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal
Revenue Code. 

        For
purposes of this document and the merger agreement: 

"Average
Anthem Price" means the average closing price of Anthem common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the 20 full trading days ending on, and including, the determination date; 

"determination
date" means the business day on which the last of the Trigon shareholder approval of the merger agreement, the Anthem shareholder approval of the issuance of shares of Anthem common
stock in the merger, the approval of the BCBSA and the receipt of all governmental consents, on terms that satisfy the merger agreement, occurs; and 

"Index
Price" means the weighted average of the closing prices of the following health benefit companies: Aetna, CIGNA, Coventry, First Health Group, Health Net, Humana, Mid Atlantic Medical Services,
Oxford Health Plans, PacifiCare Health Systems, United Health Group and Wellpoint Health Networks. 

        Anthem
will have five business days from the date of receipt of Trigon's termination notice to increase the merger consideration as described above and, if Anthem so elects, the merger
agreement will not terminate. 

Effect of Termination  

        In the event of termination of the merger agreement, the obligations of Anthem, AI Sub Acquisition Corp. and Trigon will terminate, except for the confidentiality
provisions and the provisions related to termination of the merger agreement, including Trigon's obligations to pay Anthem a termination fee under the circumstances described in the merger agreement,
as described below. There will be no liability on the part of any party to the merger agreement upon termination except those liabilities arising from a willful breach of any provision of the merger
agreement. Termination of the merger agreement will not affect the Trigon stock option agreement, other than in accordance with its terms. 

Termination Fees  

        In the merger agreement, Trigon has agreed to pay Anthem a termination fee if Anthem terminates the merger agreement under the following circumstances. 

First
,

if
: 

1.
Trigon's
board of directors is aware of the existence of a bona fide proposed Alternative Transaction or of the intention to propose a bona fide Alternative Transaction and such
proposed Alternative Transaction or intention has not been withdrawn, and

2.
the
board of directors of Trigon withdraws, amends or modifies its recommendation that Trigon shareholders approve the merger agreement in a manner that is adverse to Anthem, or adopts
or recommends an Alternative Transaction, 

then
, so long as Anthem terminates the merger agreement by the end of the first business day following notice by Trigon that its board of
directors has taken such action, and so long as the proposed Alternative Transaction or intention has not been withdrawn prior to such termination by Anthem, Trigon will pay Anthem a fee of
$94,605,750 within one business day following Anthem's termination of the merger agreement. Further, if Trigon either consummates an Alternative Transaction or enters into a definitive agreement for
an Alternative Transaction, within twelve months after Anthem's termination of the merger agreement under such circumstances, Trigon will be obligated to pay Anthem an additional fee of $94,605,750
simultaneously with such completion or entry into such definitive agreement. 

        If
Anthem terminates the merger agreement later than the end of the first business day following notice by Trigon that its board of directors has taken the action set forth above or
after the proposed Alternative Transaction or intention has been withdrawn, then Trigon shall not be obligated to pay Anthem any amount at the time of such termination; however, if Trigon either
consummates an Alternative Transaction, or enters into a definitive agreement for an Alternative Transaction within twelve months after Anthem's termination of the merger agreement under such
circumstances, Trigon will be obligated to pay Anthem a fee of $189,211,500 simultaneously with such completion or entry into such definitive agreement. 

Second
,

if

1.
there
has been a public announcement of a bona fide proposed Alternative Transaction prior to the Trigon special meeting, and such proposed Alternative Transaction has not been
publicly withdrawn at least two business days prior to such meeting date, and

2.
Trigon
shareholders do not approve the merger agreement upon a vote taken at the Trigon special meeting or at any adjournment thereof, 

then
, if Trigon either consummates an Alternative Transaction or enters into a definitive agreement for an Alternative Transaction within
twelve months after Anthem's termination of the merger agreement under such circumstances, Trigon will be obligated to pay Anthem a fee of $189,211,500 simultaneously with such completion or entry
into such definitive agreement. 

Third
,

if
, 

1.
Trigon
materially breaches its agreement to, among other things:


promptly
call a special meeting of its shareholders to approve the merger agreement,


recommend
approval of the merger agreement (except as provided under specific provisions of the merger agreement, as described above under "THE MERGER
AGREEMENTAdditional CovenantsBoard Recommendations" on page 82), 


use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain approval of the merger agreement by its shareholders,


subject
to Trigon's board fiduciary duties, not take any action to exempt any person from Virginia law restrictions on ownership of Trigon's common stock, or
ownership restrictions contained in Trigon's organizational documents, or


not
solicit, facilitate, negotiate or engage in discussions with third parties with respect to any Alternative Transaction (as described above under "THE
MERGER AGREEMENTNo Solicitations of Alternative Transactions" on page 75); and 

2.
such
breach occurs at a time when Trigon's board of directors is aware of the existence of a bona fide proposed Alternative Transaction or of the intention to propose a bona fide
Alternative Transaction and such Alternative Transaction or intention has not been withdrawn prior to such breach, 

then
, if Trigon either consummates an Alternative Transaction or enters into a definitive agreement for an Alternative Transaction within
twelve months after Anthem's termination of the merger agreement under such circumstances, Trigon will be obligated to pay Anthem a fee of $189,211,500 simultaneously with such completion or entry
into such definitive agreement. 

Treatment of Trigon Stock Options and Restricted Stock  

        Each outstanding Trigon stock option will become vested and fully exercisable upon approval of the merger agreement by Trigon shareholders, other than those stock
options held by executive officers who have agreed to waive vesting until completion of the merger. At the completion of the merger, each outstanding Trigon employee or director stock option will be
converted into fully vested options to purchase Anthem common stock.

        The number of shares of Anthem common stock underlying the new Anthem option will equal the number of shares of Trigon Class A common stock to which the corresponding Trigon
option was subject, multiplied by the option exchange ratio. The per share exercise price of each new Anthem option will be equal to the exercise price of the corresponding Trigon option divided by
the option exchange ratio. The option exchange ratio is equal to the sum of 1.062 (as such may be increased in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement) plus a fraction the numerator of which
is 30 (as may be increased in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement) and the denominator of which is the closing trading price of Anthem common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
business day prior to the completion of the merger. All other terms of the Trigon stock option will remain unchanged after the conversion. All shares of restricted Trigon Class A common stock
will vest upon approval of the merger agreement by Trigon shareholders and be treated in the merger like other shares of Trigon Class A common stock.

        Anthem
has agreed to assume Trigon's obligations with respect to the Trigon stock options that are converted into Anthem options as described above. Anthem has agreed to file a
registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 no later than completion of the merger to the extent necessary to register Anthem common stock subject to the converted options. 

Amendments and Assignment  

        The boards of directors of Anthem and Trigon may amend the merger agreement at any time before or after it has been presented to Anthem and Trigon's shareholders
but no amendment may be made after shareholder approval has been obtained if under applicable law or stock exchange requirements, such amendment would require the approval of Anthem's or Trigon's
shareholders. 

        At
any time prior to the completion of the merger, the boards of directors of Anthem and Trigon may (1) extend the time permitted for performance of any obligations or other acts
of the other parties to the merger agreement, (2) waive any inaccuracies in the parties' representations and warranties, or (3) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in the merger agreement. 

        No
rights, interests or obligations under the merger agreement are assignable by one party without the prior written consent of the other; provided that AI Sub Acquisition Corp. may
assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests or obligations to another direct wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem without Trigon's prior written consent, but will continue to be
obligated under the merger agreement. 

THE TRIGON STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT    

The following description sets forth the material provisions of the Trigon stock option agreement. This description is not complete and it
is subject to, and qualified by reference to, the Trigon stock option agreement which is attached as Appendix B to this document and is incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to read the
entire Trigon stock option agreement carefully.

 General  

        To induce Anthem to enter into the merger agreement, Trigon issued Anthem an option to purchase up to 19.9% of the number of Trigon Class A common shares
outstanding as of April 28, 2002. The exercise price is $84.25 per share, which was the closing price of a share of Trigon Class A common stock on April 26, 2002, the last trading
day before we announced the merger. The exercise price of each option and the number of shares subject to the option may be adjusted if the capitalization of Trigon changes, including through issuance
of additional Class A common stock, stock dividends and recapitalizations. However, the option can never be exercised for more than 19.9% of the number of Trigon's outstanding Class A
common shares. 

        The
Trigon stock option agreement may have the effect of making an acquisition or other business combination with Trigon by or with a third party more costly because of the need in any
such transaction to: (i) acquire any shares issued pursuant to the Trigon stock option agreement, (ii) grant a substitute option to Anthem for shares of such third party's common stock
or (iii) make any cash payments that may be due pursuant to the terms of the Trigon stock option agreement. As a result, the Trigon stock option agreement may have the effect of discouraging
offers by third parties to acquire Trigon, even if such persons were prepared to offer to pay consideration to Trigon's shareholders which has a value that is higher than the combination of the value
of Anthem's common stock and the cash consideration to be received by Trigon shareholders pursuant to the merger. 

        The
Trigon stock option agreement is not subject to the approval of Anthem or Trigon shareholders and is effective regardless of any actions taken or not taken by Anthem or Trigon
shareholders at their special meetings. To the best knowledge of Anthem and Trigon, no event giving Anthem the right to exercise the Trigon stock option agreement has occurred as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

 Exercise  

        The option will only become exercisable if the merger agreement has been terminated and Trigon consummates, or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to,
an Alternative Transaction, and the merger agreement provides that such completion or entering into such definitive agreement requires Trigon to pay Anthem the full amount of the termination fee (or
the remaining portion of such fee). See "THE MERGER AGREEMENTTermination Fees" on page 86 for a description of the circumstances under which Trigon is obligated to pay Anthem a
termination fee either in whole or in part. 

        Once
the option becomes exercisable, it may be exercised in whole or in part for up to 90 days. However, the right to exercise the option will be extended for up to a maximum of 6
additional months if time is needed to obtain regulatory or other approvals, including as may be required from the BCBSA or the Virginia State Corporation Commission for the exercise of such right, or
to avoid liability under the short-swing trading restrictions contained in Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or if an injunction prohibits exercise of such right. 

 Expiration  

        Unless previously exercised, the option will expire on the first of the following events to occur: 


the
completion of the Anthem/Trigon merger;


the
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, so long as such termination would not then or thereafter result in a termination fee
(or partial fee) being payable to Anthem under the merger agreement; or


15 months
after the termination of the merger agreement if such termination then or thereafter results in a termination fee (or partial fee) being
payable to Anthem under the merger agreement. 

 Repurchase and Surrender  

        After the option has become exercisable, Anthem may, at its election, require Trigon to repurchase the option or shares of Trigon Class A common stock
purchased thereunder at any time before the option expires. The repurchase of the option will be at a price per share equal to the amount by which the market or offer price of Trigon Class A
common stock, calculated in accordance with the Trigon stock option agreement, is higher than the option price; and the repurchase of the option shares will be at such market or offer price. 

 Limit on Profit  

        Anthem's "total profit" (as defined below) from the option and any termination fee paid pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement cannot be more than
$189,211,500. If Anthem's "total profit" would be more than such amount, before exercising its rights under the option Anthem must take actions to reduce the total profit to $189,211,500 as described
below. "Total profit" is defined to mean: 

        the
sum of: 


any
excess of the net value received by Anthem on the sale of any option shares to any unaffiliated party over the aggregate purchase price paid for such
shares;


all
amounts received by Anthem on the repurchase or surrender of the option or option shares;


all
equivalent amounts with respect to the substitute option (as described below) and related excess cash payments; and


the
amount of any termination fee paid or due and payable to Anthem under the merger agreement (unless such termination fee is payable and has not been paid
by Trigon in breach of the merger agreement or due to written waiver of such fee by Anthem); 

        minus: 


any
cash paid and the value of all option shares or other securities delivered to the issuer to reduce Anthem's total profit. 

        Also,
the option may not be exercised for a number of shares that would result in a "notional total profit" (as defined below) of more than $189,211,500. If the exercise of the option
would otherwise result in a higher notional amount, then before purchasing the shares the holder must take actions to reduce the notional total profit to $189,211,500. "Notional total profit" is
defined to mean, with respect to any shares subject to a proposed exercise of the option, the total profit (as defined above) on the proposed exercise date assuming the exercise occurred on such date
and all shares purchased under the option and then held by the holder and its affiliates were sold for cash at the closing market price on the preceding trading day. 

        If
the total profit or notional total profit exceeds $189,211,500, Anthem at its sole election, must take one or more of the following actions so that its actual realized total profit
does not exceed $189,211,500: 


reduce
the number of shares subject to the option (and any substitute option);


deliver
to Trigon (or the issuer of a substitute option) for cancellation shares of Trigon Class A common stock (or such third party's common stock),
previously purchased by Anthem, at fair market value at the time of delivery;


pay
cash to Trigon (or such third party);


increase
or adjust the exercise price of the option (or substitute option);


reduce
the amount of the repurchase price of the option (or substitute option); or


any
combination of the foregoing. 

 Substitute Option  

        The Trigon stock option agreement provides that, while the option is outstanding, if Trigon agrees to one of the following transactions: 


a
merger, consolidation or plan of exchange with a third party in which Trigon does not survive;


a
merger or plan of exchange with a third party in which Trigon survives but its Class A common stock is converted into securities of another company
or cash or other property or ends up representing less than 50% of the merged or acquiring company; or


a
sale to a third party of all or substantially all of Trigon's or any significant subsidiary's assets, 

then,
any agreement by Trigon to one of these transactions must allow Anthem to receive a new option when the transaction is completed. This new option is called a "substitute option" because it
substitutes for the existing option. 

        Anthem
will have the ability to select the common shares that are covered by the new substitute option. Anthem can select the common shares of any of the following, although not all may
apply to any particular transaction: 


the
continuing or surviving person of a consolidation or merger with Trigon (if other than Trigon);


the
acquiring person in a plan of exchange in which Trigon is acquired;


Trigon
in a merger or plan of exchange in which Trigon is the continuing or surviving acquiring person;


the
transferee of all or substantially all of the assets of Trigon or any of its significant subsidiaries; or


any
person that controls any of the foregoing entities. 

        The
substitute option will have the same economic value as the original option, but the number of shares for which the substitute option will be exercisable will be equal to a number of
shares calculated according to the following formula: 

    M  S    

AP

Where:

M=

the market or offer price for Trigon's Class A common stock, calculated in accordance with the Trigon stock option agreement;

S=

twice the number of shares for which the original option was exercisable; and

AP=

the average closing price of a share of the common stock issued by the issuer of the substitute option for the one year immediately preceding the transaction resulting in the issuance of the substitute option, but in no
event higher than the closing price of the shares of such common stock on the day preceding such transaction.

However,
in no event will the sum of (1) shares issuable pursuant to the terms of the substitute option and (2) the number of shares that Anthem would hold if all shares of Trigon
Class A common stock received upon the exercise of the original option were converted in a transaction in which the substitute option were issued, exceed 19.9% of the common stock of the issuer
of the substitute option prior to the exercise of the substitute option and Anthem will receive a cash payment equal to the value of the substitute option (had the foregoing restriction not applied)
minus the value of the substitute option applying such restriction. Other than its exercise price and the number of shares
purchasable thereunder, which will be adjusted as provided in the Trigon stock option agreement, the substitute option will otherwise have the same terms and conditions as the original option, unless
otherwise required by law. 

        The
following summarizes some terms of the original option and the substitute option: 

Original Option

Substitute Option

Issuer: Trigon

Issuer: Selected by Anthem based on the transaction Trigon agrees to

Number of shares covered:

19.9% of Trigon's Class A common shares

Number of shares covered:

Determined based on the formula set forth above,

but not to exceed 19.9% of Issuer's common stock

Exercise Price: $84.25, representing the closing price of Trigon's Class A common stock on the last trading day prior to announcement of the merger

Exercise Price: Determined so that, taking into account the increase in the number of shares subject to the option, the economic value of the option is the same as the original option

Maximum Profit: Approximately $189 million

Maximum Profit: Approximately $189 million

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT    

        The merger of Trigon with and into AI Sub Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem, in which AI Sub Acquisition Corp. will be the surviving
corporation, will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Anthem will establish a new accounting basis for the assets and liabilities of Trigon based upon their fair values, the
value of the consideration deemed to be provided to Trigon's shareholders in connection with the merger and the costs of the merger. Anthem will record as goodwill the excess, if any, of the
consideration over the fair values of Trigon's assets and liabilities. A final determination of required purchase accounting adjustments, including the allocation of consideration to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, has

not yet been made. Accordingly, the purchase accounting adjustments made in connection with the development of the pro forma combined financial statements of Anthem appearing elsewhere in this
document are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing pro forma combined financial information. Anthem will undertake to determine the fair value of certain of Trigon's assets
and liabilities (as so adjusted) and will make appropriate purchase accounting adjustments upon completion of that determination. For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations of Trigon
will be included in Anthem's consolidated statement of income following the completion of the merger. Anthem's financial statements for prior periods will not be restated as a result of the merger or
related transactions.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
  OF THE MERGER    

        A condition to the completion of the merger is that each of Anthem and Trigon receives an opinion from its respective tax counsel that (1) the merger will be treated for federal
income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and (2) Anthem, AI Sub Acquisition Corp. and Trigon will each be a party to
the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. These opinions will be based on updated representations provided by Anthem and Trigon at the time of closing, and on
customary factual assumptions.

        Anthem
and Trigon have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding any matters relating to the merger, and as a result, there can be no assurance
that the Internal Revenue Service will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions described herein. 

        The following discussion sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of Trigon Class A common stock. This
discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department and court and administrative rulings and decisions in effect on the
date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, any of which may change, possibly retroactively. A change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. This discussion does not address tax
consequences that may vary with, or are contingent upon, the individual circumstances of holders of Trigon Class A common stock. Moreover, it does not address any non-income tax or
any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger. Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the merger to holders of Trigon Class A common stock will depend upon
the facts of their particular situation. Accordingly, we strongly urge holders of Trigon Class A common stock to consult with their tax advisors to determine the particular federal, state,
local or foreign income or other tax consequences to them of the merger.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a holder of Trigon Class A common stock who is:


an
individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;


a
corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized under the laws of the United States or any of its political subdivisions;


a
trust that (1) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons or
(2) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person; or


an
estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

        This discussion assumes that you hold your shares of Trigon Class A common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of the Code. Further, this discussion does not address all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances or that may be applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the U.S.
federal income tax laws, including if you are:


a
financial institution;


a
tax-exempt organization;


an
S corporation or other pass-through entity;


an
insurance company;


a
mutual fund; 


a
dealer in stocks and securities, or foreign currencies;


a
trader in securities who elects the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;


a
holder of Trigon Class A common stock subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code;


a
holder of Trigon Class A common stock who received your Trigon Class A common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or
otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan;


a
foreign holder or a person that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;


a
holder of options granted under any Trigon benefit plan; or


a
holder of Trigon Class A common stock who holds Trigon Class A common stock as part of a hedge against currency risk, a straddle or a
constructive sale or a conversion transaction.

        Based on representations provided by Anthem and Trigon and on certain customary factual assumptions, all of which must continue to be true, accurate and complete in all material respects
as of the completion of the merger, it is the opinion of Baker & Daniels, counsel to Anthem, and McGuireWoods LLP, counsel to Trigon, that the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the merger will be as follows:


the
merger will be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;


subject
to the paragraph captioned "Additional ConsiderationsRecharacterization of Gain as a Dividend" below, upon exchanging Trigon
Class A common stock for a combination of cash and shares of Anthem common stock in the merger, a holder of Trigon Class A common stock will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount
equal to the lesser of:


the
excess, if any, of: (i) the sum of the cash (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Anthem common stock) and the fair market
value of the shares of Anthem common stock you receive (including any fractional share of Anthem you are deemed to receive and exchange for cash), over (ii) your tax basis in the Trigon
Class A common stock surrendered in the merger, or


the
cash that you receive in the merger; 


your
tax basis in the shares of Anthem common stock that you receive in the merger (including any fractional share interest you are deemed to receive and
exchange for cash) will equal your tax basis in the Trigon Class A common stock you surrendered in the merger, increased by the amount of taxable gain, if any, you recognize on the exchange and
decreased by the amount of any cash received by you in the merger (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Anthem common stock); and


your
holding period for the shares of Anthem common stock that you receive in the merger (including any fractional share interest that you are deemed to
receive and exchange for cash) will include your holding period for the shares of Trigon Class A common stock that you surrender in the exchange.

        If you acquired different blocks of Trigon Class A common stock at different times and at different prices, any gain or loss will be determined separately with respect to each
block of Trigon Class A common stock, and the cash and shares of Anthem common stock you receive will be allocated pro rata to each such block of stock. In addition, your basis and holding
period in your shares of Anthem common stock may be determined with reference to each block of Trigon Class A common stock.

        Taxation of Capital Gain.
    Except as described under "Additional ConsiderationsRecharacterization of Gains as a
Dividend" below, gain or loss that you recognize in connection with the merger will generally constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if your
holding period in your Trigon Class A common stock is greater than one year as of the date of the merger. If you are a non-corporate holder of Trigon Class A common stock,
long-term capital gain generally will be taxed at a maximum United States federal income tax rate of 20%. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. 

        Additional ConsiderationsRecharacterization of Gain as a Dividend.
    All or part of the gain you recognize could
be treated as ordinary dividend income rather than capital gain if (i) you are a significant shareholder of Anthem or (ii) if taking into account constructive ownership rules, your
percentage ownership in Anthem after the merger is not less than what your percentage ownership would have been if you had received solely shares of Anthem common stock rather than a combination of
cash and shares of Anthem common stock in the merger. This could happen, for example, because of a purchase of additional shares of Anthem common stock by you, a purchase of shares of Anthem common
stock by a person related to you or a share repurchase by Anthem from other holders of Anthem common stock. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends upon your particular circumstances,
including the application of certain constructive ownership rules, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the potential tax consequences of the merger to you. Under the constructive
ownership rules, a shareholder may be deemed to own stock that is owned by others, such as a family member, trust, corporation or other entity.

        Cash in lieu of Fractional Shares.
    You will generally recognize capital gain or loss on any cash received in lieu of a
fractional share of Anthem common stock equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the basis allocated to such fractional share. Any such capital gain or loss will be
long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period in your Trigon Class A common stock is greater than one year at the time of the merger. 

        Backup Withholding.
    If you are a non-corporate holder of Trigon Class A common stock you may be subject to

BUSINESS OF ANTHEM    

General Description of Anthem's Business  

        Anthem is one of the nation's largest health benefits companies, serving approximately eight million members, primarily in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut,
New Hampshire, Maine, Colorado and Nevada. Anthem holds the leading market position in seven of these eight states and owns the exclusive right to market its products and services using the BCBS names
and marks in all eight states under license agreements with the BCBSA, an association of independent BCBS plans. Anthem seeks to be a leader in its industry by offering a broad selection of flexible
and competitively priced health benefits products. 

        Its product portfolio includes a diversified mix of managed care products, including health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, and point of
service, or POS plans, as well as traditional indemnity products. Anthem also offers a broad range of administrative and managed care services and partially insured products for employer
self-funded plans. These services and products include underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, claims processing and other
administrative services. In addition, Anthem offers its customers several specialty products including group life, disability, prescription management, dental and vision. Its products allow its
customers to choose from a wide array of funding alternatives. For its insured products, Anthem charges a premium and assumes all or a majority of the health care risk. Under its
self-funded and partially insured products, Anthem charges a fee for services, and the employer or plan sponsor reimburses Anthem for all or a majority of the health care costs. Anthem's
2001 operating revenue was 91.3% derived from fully insured products, while 8.7% was derived from administrative services and other revenues.

        Anthem's
customer base primarily includes large groups (contracts with 51 or more eligible employees), individuals and small groups (one to 50 employees), each of which accounted for
40.4%, 18.1% and 17.7% of its 2001 operating revenue, respectively. Other major customer categories include National accounts, Medicare recipients, federal employees and other federally funded
programs. Anthem principally markets its products through an extensive network of independent agents and brokers who are compensated on a commission basis for new sales and retention of existing
business. 

        Anthem's
managed care plans and products are designed to encourage providers and members to make quality, cost-effective health care decisions by utilizing the full range of
its innovative medical management services, quality initiatives and financial incentives. Anthem's leading market shares enable Anthem to realize the long-term benefits of investing in
preventive and early detection disease management programs. Anthem further improves its ability to provide cost-effective health benefits products and services through a disciplined
approach to internal cost containment, prudent management of its risk exposure and successful integration of acquired businesses. These measures have allowed Anthem to achieve significant growth in
membership (93%), revenue (100%), and net income (256%) from the beginning of 1997 through 2001. 

        Anthem
intends to continue to expand through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions in both existing and new markets. Anthem's growth strategy is designed to enable
Anthem to take advantage of the additional economies of scale provided by increased overall membership. In addition, Anthem believes geographic diversity reduces its exposure to local or regional
economic, regulatory and competitive pressures and provides Anthem with increased opportunities for expansion. While the majority of its growth has been the result of strategic mergers and
acquisitions, Anthem has also achieved growth in its existing markets by providing excellent service, offering competitively priced products and effectively capturing the brand strength of the BCBS
names and marks. 

        Anthem
is an Indiana corporation that was formed in July 2001 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem Insurance. Anthem was formed in connection with the conversion of Anthem
Insurance from a 

mutual insurance company into a stock insurance company in a process called demutualization. The demutualization was effective on November 2, 2001, and at that time Anthem Insurance was
converted into a stock insurance company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem, and Anthem became a publicly held company. In addition, effective November 2, 2001, all membership
interests in Anthem Insurance were extinguished and Anthem Insurance's eligible statutory members received shares of Anthem common stock or cash, as consideration for the extinguishment of their
membership interests in Anthem Insurance. 

Industry Overview  

        The health benefits industry has experienced significant change in recent years. The increasing focus on health care costs by employers, the government and
consumers has led to the growth of alternatives to traditional indemnity health insurance. HMO, PPO and hybrid plans, such as POS plans, incorporating features of each, are among the various forms of
managed care products that have developed in recent years. Through these types of products, the cost of health care is contained by negotiating contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers
to deliver health care at favorable rates. These products also can feature medical management and other quality and cost containment measures such as pre-admission review and approval for
non-emergency hospital services, pre-authorization of outpatient surgical procedures, and network credentialing to determine that network doctors and hospitals have the
required certifications and expertise. In addition, providers may share medical cost risk or have
other incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. HMO, PPO and POS enrollees generally are charged periodic, pre-paid premiums, and pay
co-payments or deductibles when they receive services. PPO and POS plans provide benefits for out-of-network usage, typically at higher
out-of-pocket costs to members. HMO members generally select one of the network's primary care physicians who then assumes responsibility for coordinating their health care
services. Typically, there is no out-of-network benefit for HMO members. PPOs and other open access plans generally provide coverage when members select non-network
providers without coordination through a primary care physician, but at a higher out-of-pocket cost. Hybrid plans, such as POS plans, typically involve the selection of primary
care physicians similar to HMOs, but allow members to self refer or to choose non-network providers at higher out-of-pocket costs similar to those of PPOs. 

        Recently,
economic factors and greater consumer awareness have resulted in the increasing popularity of products that offer larger, more extensive networks, more member choice related to
coverage and the ability to self refer within those networks. There is also a growing preference for greater flexibility to assume larger deductibles and co-payments in exchange for lower
premiums. Anthem believes it is well positioned in each of its regions to respond to these market preferences. Anthem's PPO products, which contain most or all of the features noted above, have
experienced significant growth over the past few years. 

        The
BCBSA has also undergone significant change in recent years. Historically, most states had at least one Blue Cross (hospital coverage) and a separate Blue Shield (physician coverage)
company. Prior to the mid 1980s there were more than 125 separate Blue Cross or Blue Shield companies. Many of these organizations have merged, reducing the number of independent licensees to 43 as of
December 2001. Anthem expects this trend to continue, with plans merging or affiliating to address capital needs and other competitive pressures. 

        Each
of the BCBS plans work cooperatively in a number of ways that create significant market advantages, especially when competing for very large multi-state employer groups. As a result
of this cooperation, each plan is able to take advantage of other member plans' substantial provider networks and discounts when any member from one state works or travels outside of the state in
which the policy is written. Anthem receives a substantial and growing source of revenue under this "BlueCard" 

program for providing member services in its states for individuals who are customers of other BCBS plans. 

Anthem's Operating Segments  

        Anthem's reportable segments are strategic business units delineated by geographic areas within which Anthem offers similar products and services, but manages
with a local focus to address each geographic region's unique market, regulatory and health care delivery characteristics. The regions are: 


the
Midwest, which includes Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio;


the
East, which includes Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine; and


the
West, which includes Colorado and Nevada. 

        In
addition to Anthem's three geographic regions, Anthem has a Specialty segment and an Other segment. Anthem's Specialty segment includes business units providing: 


group
life and disability insurance benefits;


pharmacy
benefit management;


dental
and vision administration services; and


third
party occupational health services. 

        Various
ancillary business units (reported with the Other segment) include AdminaStar Federal, a subsidiary which administers Medicare programs in Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio. 

        The
Other segment also includes intersegment revenue, expense eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to reportable segments. 

Anthem's Strategy  

        Anthem's strategic objective is to be among the best and biggest in its industry with the size and scale to deliver the best product value with the best people. 

        To
achieve these goals, Anthem offers a broad selection of flexible and competitively priced products and seeks to establish leading market positions. Anthem believes that increased
scale in each of its regional markets will provide Anthem competitive advantages, cost efficiencies and greater opportunities to sustain profitable growth. The key to Anthem's ability to deliver this
growth is its commitment to work with providers to optimize the cost and quality of care while improving the health of its members and improving the quality of its service. 

Promote Quality Care  

        Anthem believes that its ability to help its members receive quality, cost-effective health care will be key to its success. Anthem promotes the
health of its members through education and through products that cover prevention and early detection programs that help its members and their providers manage illness before higher cost intervention
is required. To help develop those programs, Anthem collaborates with the providers in its networks to promote improved quality of care for its members. The following policies and programs are key to
improving the quality of care that its members receive: 


Selection and continued assessment of provider networks
: Anthem's networks consist of providers who meet and
maintain its standards of medical education, training and professional experience.


Disease management
: Anthem develops disease management programs that educate members on actions they can take
to help monitor and better control their illnesses and to manage diseases such as diabetes, asthma and congestive heart failure. 


Prevention measures
: Anthem works with providers and members to promote preventive measures such as childhood
and adult immunizations, as well as breast cancer screening.


Education
: Anthem helps its members prevent disease and illness or minimize their impact by promoting
lifestyle modification through education. For example, its nationally recognized smoking cessation program in Maine has helped to reduce the number of its members in Maine who smoke by 49% over four
years.


Technology
: Anthem also utilizes technology to evaluate the medical care provided to its customers. For
example, its Anthem Prescription Management decision support system helps to identify potentially harmful drug interactions and helps prevent members from receiving potentially dangerous combinations
of drugs. 

Product Value  

        Anthem works to create products that offer value to its customers. By offering a wide spectrum of products supported by broad provider networks, Anthem seeks to
meet the differing needs of its various customers. The breadth and flexibility of its benefit plan options, coupled with quality care initiatives, are designed to appeal to a broad base of employer
groups and individuals with differing product and service preferences. Anthem uses innovative product design, such as a three-tiered prescription program that provides customer selection among
generic, brand and formulary drugs at various out-of-pocket costs. Innovative product designs help Anthem contain costs and allow its products to be competitively priced in the
market. 

        Formulary
drugs are prescription drugs that have been reviewed and selected by a committee of practicing doctors and clinical pharmacists for their quality and cost effectiveness. Use of
medications from the formulary, which includes hundreds of brand name and generic medications, is encouraged through pharmacy benefit design. A three-tier pharmacy benefit and the use of
formulary drugs allow members access to highly useful prescription medications, while also helping to control the cost of pharmacy benefits to employers. Members have the same access to medications
but share a greater portion of the cost for brand name drugs through the co-payment structure. Under a three-tier program, the customer pays the lowest price for generic drugs,
a higher price for formulary brand name drugs and the highest price for brand name drugs not included in the formulary. 

Operational Excellence  

        To provide cost-effective products, Anthem continuously strives to improve operational efficiency. Anthem actively benchmarks its performance against
other leading health benefits companies to identify opportunities to drive continuous performance improvement. Important performance measures Anthem uses include operating margin, administrative
expense ratio, administrative expense per member per month, or PMPM, and return on equity. Current initiatives to drive operational efficiency include: 


consolidating
and eliminating information systems;


standardizing
operations and processes;


implementing
e-business strategies; and


integrating
acquired businesses. 

Technology  

        Anthem continuously reviews opportunities to improve its interactions with customers, brokers and providers. By utilizing technologies, Anthem seeks to make the
interactions as simple, efficient and productive as possible. Anthem monitors itself using industry standard customer service metrics, which 

measure, among other things, call center efficiency, claims paying accuracy and speed of enrollment. Anthem eases the administrative burden of enrolling new accounts, processing claims and updating
records for its brokers and providers by automating many of these processes. Anthem also collects information that enables Anthem to further improve customer service, product design and underwriting
decisions. 

Growth  

        Anthem believes that profitable growth, both organic and through acquisitions, is an important part of its business. Increased scale allows Anthem to increase
customer convenience and improve operating margins, while keeping its products competitively priced. Expansion into new geographic markets enables Anthem to reduce exposure to economic cycles and
regulatory changes and provides options for business expansion. Anthem plans to generate earnings growth first by increasing revenues through new enrollment, while maintaining pricing discipline. In
addition, Anthem plans to grow its specialty segment by increasing the penetration of specialty products to existing health members through cross selling and expansion into non-Anthem
markets. These specialty products include prescription management, vision, dental, group life and disability insurance. While enjoying a leading market share in seven of its eight markets, Anthem has
market shares ranging from 18% to 47% and believes there is remaining opportunity to grow profitably in each market. Anthem also intends to make strategic acquisitions to augment its internal growth. 

Anthem's History  

        Anthem was formed in 1944 under the name of Mutual Hospital Insurance, Inc., commonly known as Blue Cross of Indiana. In 1946, Mutual Medical
Insurance Inc., also known as Blue Shield of Indiana, was incorporated as an Indiana mutual insurance company. In 1985, these two companies merged under the name Associated Insurance
Companies, Inc. In 1993, Southeastern Mutual Insurance Company, a Kentucky-domiciled mutual insurance company doing business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kentucky, was merged into Anthem.
In 1995, Community Mutual Insurance Company, an Ohio-domiciled mutual insurance company doing business as Community Mutual Blue Cross and Blue Shield, was merged into Anthem. Anthem
changed its name to Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc. in 1996. In 1997, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., or BCBS-CT, a Connecticut-domiciled
mutual insurance company, was merged into Anthem Insurance. Anthem completed its purchases of New Hampshire-Vermont Health Service, which did business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire,
or BCBS-NH, and Rocky Mountain Hospital and Medical Service, which did business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Colorado and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nevada, or
BCBS-CO/NV, during 1999. In 2000, Anthem completed its purchase of Associated Hospital Service of Maine, which did business as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maine, or BCBS-ME.
In November of 2001, Anthem completed its demutualization, in which Anthem Insurance converted from a mutual insurance company to a stock insurance company, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Anthem, a holding company formed in connection with the demutualization. 

Anthem's Acquisitions and Merger History  

        Much of Anthem's recent growth in membership has resulted from strategic mergers and acquisitions, primarily with other BCBS licensees. These combinations,
coupled with growth in existing markets, have enabled Anthem to establish multi-regional centers of focus with a significant share of 

each region's health benefits market. The following table sets forth Anthem's membership by state as of the dates indicated:

certain management and support functions, sharing best practices and consolidating information systems. Anthem also improves underwriting practices by establishing discipline in its data analysis and
product design. 

Pending Acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas  

General  

        On May 30, 2001, Anthem signed a definitive agreement with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc., or BCBS-KS, in which Anthem
agreed to acquire BCBS-KS. On February 11, 2002, the Kansas Insurance Commissioner disapproved the proposed transaction, which had been previously approved by the
BCBS-KS policyholders in January 2002. On February 19, 2002, the board of directors 

of BCBS-KS voted unanimously to appeal the Kansas Insurance Commissioner's decision and BCBS-KS is seeking to have the decision overturned in Shawnee County District Court.
The Company joined BCBS-KS in the appeal, which was filed on March 7, 2002. On June 7, 2002, the Court ruled in favor of Anthem and BCBS-KS, vacating the Commissioner's
decision and remanding the matter to the Commissioner for further proceedings not inconsistent with the Court's order. Anthem and BCBS-KS are reviewing the ruling and considering their next steps.

        Under
the proposed transaction, BCBS-KS would convert from a mutual insurance company to a stock insurance company through a process known as a sponsored demutualization.
Under the agreement, BCBS-KS policyholders eligible to receive consideration in its demutualization would be entitled to receive $190.0 million, a portion of which (totaling
$48.0 million) Anthem would pay in cash to the escrow described below at the closing of the transaction. The remaining $142.0 million not placed in escrow would be distributed directly
to eligible BCBS-KS policyholders. The amount placed in the escrow account would be held in escrow pending the resolution of a matter involving a subpoena dated February 28, 2001,
received by BCBS-KS from the Office of Inspector General, or OIG. The subpoena seeks documents related to an investigation of possible improper claims against Medicare. The amount held in
escrow would be used to pay costs, expenses and liabilities related to the OIG investigation, and to pay costs and expenses of the escrow, with any remaining amount to be distributed to eligible
BCBS-KS members following final resolution of the matter. In addition, at or prior to the closing, BCBS-KS would declare a special distribution payable after the closing to its
eligible policyholders in an amount equal to the excess of BCBS-KS' consolidated closing book value over $155.0 million. 

BCBS-KS  

        BCBS-KS is the largest health insurer in Kansas. BCBS-KS provides insurance coverage or self-insured administration services
to more than 800,000 individuals in all Kansas counties except Johnson and
Wyandotte, two counties near Kansas City. BCBS-KS also administers Medicare and Medicaid government programs. 

        BCBS-KS
offers a wide range of health benefit products including traditional indemnity products and HMO, POS and PPO managed care products. BCBS-KS also offers
claims administration and stop-loss coverage for employer self-funded plans, as well as underwriting, actuarial services, provider network access, and medical cost management.
Additionally, BCBS-KS offers several specialty insurance products, including group life, disability, dental and long-term care. 

        For
the year ended December 31, 2001, BCBS-KS had total revenue of $1,011.5 million and a net loss of $12.2 million and, at December 31, 2001,
assets of $723.1 million and surplus of $314.5 million. 

Anthem's Core Health Benefits Products and Services  

        Anthem offers a diversified mix of managed care products, including HMO, PPO and POS plans, as well as traditional indemnity products. Anthem's managed care
products incorporate a broad range of options and financial incentives for both members and participating providers, including co-payments and provider risk pools. Anthem also offers a
broad range of administrative and managed care services and partially insured products for employer self-funded plans. These services and products include underwriting, stop loss
insurance, actuarial services, network access, medical cost management, claims processing and other administrative services. Anthem charges a premium for insured plans and typically assumes all or a
majority of the liability for the cost of health care. For self-funded or partially-insured products, Anthem charges a fee for services while the employer assumes all or a majority of the
risks. The fee is based upon the customer's selection from its portfolio of services. Anthem also provides specialty products including group life, disability, prescription management, dental and
vision care. Anthem's principal health products, offered both on an insured and employer-funded basis, are described below. Some managed care and medical cost containment features may be included in
each 

of these products, such as inpatient pre-certification, benefits for preventive services and reimbursement at its maximum allowable amount with no additional billing to members. 

        Preferred Provider Organization, or PPO.
    PPO products offer the member an option to select any health care provider, with
benefits paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider. Coverage is subject to co-payments or deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing
limited by out-of-pocket maximums. 

        Traditional Indemnity.
    Indemnity products offer the member an option to select any health care provider for covered services.
Coverage is subject to deductibles and coinsurance, with member cost sharing limited by out-of-pocket maximums. 

        Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO.
    HMO products include comprehensive managed care benefits, generally through a
participating network of physicians, hospitals and other providers. A member in one of Anthem's HMOs must typically select a primary care physician, or PCP, from its network. PCPs generally are family
practitioners, internists or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care, and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care. Preventive care
services are emphasized in these plans. Anthem offers HMO plans with varying levels of co-payments, which result in different levels of premium rates. 

        Point-of-Service, or POS.
    POS products blend the characteristics of HMO and indemnity plans. Members
can have comprehensive HMO-style benefits through participating network providers with minimum out-of-pocket expense (co-payments) and also can go
directly, without a referral, to any provider they choose, subject to, among other things, certain deductibles and coinsurance. Member cost sharing is limited by out-of-pocket
maximums. 

        BlueCard Plan.
    BCBS plans across the United States share their local provider networks in a unique arrangement, where one
plan's enrolled members travel or live in another plan's service area. The local or "host" plan is paid an administrative fee by the "home" or selling plan in exchange for providing claims and member
services to home plan customers in the host plan's service area. All claims are reimbursed by the home plan, which may have an insured or self-funded relationship with the member's
employer under any of the product designs discussed above. BlueCard membership is calculated based on the amount of BlueCard administrative fees Anthem receives from the BlueCard members' home plans.
Generally, the administrative fees Anthem receives are based on the number and type of claims processed and a portion of the network discount on those claims. The administrative fees are then divided
by an assumed per member per month, or PMPM, factor in order to calculate the number of members. The assumed PMPM factor is based on an estimate of Anthem's experience and BCBSA guidelines.

Anthem's Specialty Products and Services  

        Prescription Management Services.
    Anthem provides pharmacy network management, pharmacy benefits and mail order prescription
services through its subsidiary, Anthem Prescription Management, or APM, its pharmacy benefit manager. APM administers its programs primarily to customers who are also Anthem health plan members.
Anthem Rx, Anthem's retail pharmacy network, provides members access to more than 49,000 chain and independent pharmacies across the United States, and Anthem Rx Direct, its mail service pharmacy,
provides long-term therapy medications through convenient home delivery. 

        Group Life and Disability.
    Anthem offers an array of competitive group life insurance and disability benefit products to both
large and small group customers. At March 31, 2002, Anthem had over $22.9 billion of life insurance in force, insuring over 33,500 groups with more than 850,000 employees. Anthem's
traditional group insurance products include term life, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term disability income and long-term disability income. In addition, Anthem
offers voluntary group life and disability products through employers which payroll-deduct premiums from their participating employees.

        Vision and Dental Care Programs.
    These programs are primarily for customers enrolled in Anthem's BCBS health plans. Vision
and dental products available include both fully insured and self-insured products. In addition, Anthem provides dental third-party administration services through Health Management
Systems, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary.

Anthem's Other Products and Services  

        In addition to the above-described products and services, Anthem provides services as a fiscal intermediary for the Medicare Part A and Part B
program in certain states. 

Anthem's Marketing  

        Anthem markets its managed care and specialty products through three regional business units. Anthem's health plans are generally marketed under the BCBS brand,
except for certain government programs. Anthem organizes its marketing efforts by customer segment and by region in order to maximize its ability to meet the specific needs of its customers. Marketing
programs are developed by a cross-functional team including the actuarial, underwriting, sales, operations and finance departments to evaluate risk and pricing and to ensure adherence to established
underwriting guidelines. Anthem
believes its reputation, financial stability, high quality customer service and exclusive BCBS license provide Anthem with competitive advantages and allow Anthem to gain share in its markets. Anthem
strives to develop solutions for its customers. Anthem's keys to success include developing long-term relationships and providing stable pricing of its products. Most contracts are for one
year, although Anthem occasionally enters into multi-year arrangements. 

        Anthem
maintains the quality of its sales staff and independent brokers through regularly held training seminars and advisory groups, which familiarize them with evolving consumer
preferences, as well as its products and current marketing strategies. In addition, Anthem structures sales commissions to provide incentives to its sales staff and brokers to promote the full value
of its products. Each region is responsible for enrolling, underwriting and servicing its respective businesses. 

Anthem's Customers  

        In each region, Anthem balances the need to customize products with the efficiencies of product standardization. Overall, Anthem seeks to establish pricing and
product designs to achieve an appropriate level of profitability for each of its customer categories. Anthem's customers include several distinguishable categories: 


Local
Large groups, defined as contracts with 51 or more eligible employees (but excluding "National business," described below), accounted for 41.3% of
Anthem's operating revenue and 

34.2%
of its members as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2002. These groups are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from Anthem's
in-house sales force. Large group cases are usually experience rated or sold on a self-insured basis. The customer's buying decision is typically based upon the size and
breadth of Anthem's networks, the quality of its medical management services, the administrative cost included in its quoted price, its financial stability and its ability to effectively service large
complex accounts.


Small
groups, defined as contracts with one to 50 eligible employees, accounted for 18.3% of Anthem's operating revenue and 9.9% of its members as of and for
the three months ended March 31, 2002. These groups are sold exclusively through independent agents and brokers. Small group cases are sold on a fully insured basis. Underwriting and pricing is
done on a community rated basis, with individual state insurance departments approving the rates. See "BUSINESS OF ANTHEMRegulationSmall Group Reform" below. Small group
customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. Account turnover is generally higher with
small groups.


Individual
policies (under age 65) accounted for 5.6% of Anthem's operating revenue and 4.1% of its members as of and for the three months ended
March 31, 2002. These policies are generally sold
through independent agents and brokers. In some cases an in-house telemarketing unit is used to generate leads. This business is usually medically underwritten at the point of initial
issuance. Rates are filed with and approved by state insurance departments. In several of Anthem's markets, there is much less competition for individual business than group business.


Medicare
Supplement business accounted for 6.7% of Anthem's operating revenue and 4.9% of its members as of and for the three months ended March 31,
2002. These standardized policies are sold to Medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the Medicare program. New policyholders come from independent agents or brokers or
through the conversion of existing group members or individual policyholders when they retire and reach age 65.


The
Federal Employee Program accounted for 10.9% of Anthem's operating revenue and 5.5% of its members as of and for the three months ended March 31,
2002. As a BCBSA licensee, Anthem participates in a nationwide contract with the Federal government whereby Anthem covers Federal employees and their dependents in its eight-state service area. Under
a complex formula, Anthem is reimbursed for its costs plus a fee. Anthem also participates in the overall financial risk for medical claims on a pooled basis with the other participating BCBS plans.


Medicare + Choice
accounted for 5.8% of Anthem's operating revenue and 1.2% of its members as of and for the three months ended
March 31, 2002. This program is the managed care alternative to the federally funded Medicare program. Most of the premium is paid directly by the Federal government on behalf of the
participant who may also be charged a small premium. Medicare + Choice is marketed in the same manner as Medicare Supplement products.


National
business (including BlueCard) accounted for 5.4% of Anthem's operating revenue, but 38.7% of its members as of and for the three months ended
March 31, 2002, because much of its National business is self-insured. These groups are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with Anthem's in-house
sales force. Anthem has significant competitive advantage when competing for very large National accounts due to its ability to access the national network of BCBS plans and take advantage of their
provider discounts in their local markets.

Anthem's Blue Cross Blue Shield License  

        Anthem has the exclusive right to use the BCBS names and marks for all of its health benefits products in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire,
Maine, Colorado and Nevada. Anthem believes that the BCBS names and marks are valuable identifiers of its products and services in the marketplace. The license agreements, which have a perpetual term,
contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding its operations and its use of the BCBS names and marks. Upon termination of the license agreements, Anthem would cease to have the right to use
the BCBS names and marks in one or more of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Colorado and Nevada, and the BCBSA could thereafter issue a license to use the BCBS names and
marks in these states to another entity. Events that could cause the termination of a license agreement with the BCBSA include: 


failure
to comply with minimum capital requirements imposed by the BCBSA;


impending
financial insolvency;


the
appointment of a trustee or receiver;


a
change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on its capital stock; and


the
commencement of any action seeking our dissolution. 

        Pursuant
to the rules and license standards of the BCBSA, Anthem guarantees the contractual and financial obligations to respective customers of its subsidiaries that hold controlled
affiliate licenses from the BCBSA. Those subsidiaries are Anthem Health Plans of Kentucky, Inc., Anthem Life Insurance Company, Anthem Health Plans, Inc., Community Insurance Company,
Anthem Health Plans of New Hampshire, Inc., Rocky Mountain Hospital and Medical Service, Inc., Anthem Health Plans of Maine, Inc., HMO Colorado, Inc., Matthew Thornton
Health Plan, Inc., Maine Partners Health Plan, Inc. and Health Management Systems, Inc. 

        In addition, pursuant to the rules and license standards of the BCBSA, Anthem has agreed to indemnify BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and
financial obligations of AdminaStar Federal, its subsidiary which serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Part A and B. 

        Each
license requires an annual fee to be paid to the BCBSA. The fee is based upon enrollment and premium. BCBSA is a national trade association of BCBS licensees, the primary function
of which is to promote and preserve the integrity of the BCBS names and marks, as well as provide certain coordination among the member plans. Each BCBSA licensee is an independent legal organization
and is not responsible for obligations of other BCBSA member organizations. Anthem has no right to market products and services using the BCBS names and marks outside of its eight core states. 

Anthem's Information Systems  

        Information systems have played and will continue to play a key role in Anthem's ongoing efforts to continuously improve quality, lower costs and increase benefit
flexibility for its customers. Anthem's analytical technologies are designed to support increasingly sophisticated methods of managing costs and monitoring quality of care, and Anthem believes that
its information systems are sufficient to meet current needs and future expansion plans. 

        Anthem
uses a combination of custom developed and licensed systems throughout its regions. An overall systems architecture is maintained to promote consistency of data and reduce
duplicative platforms. This architecture assumes single separate core systems supporting each of Anthem's operating regions with centralized systems for key company-wide functions such as
financial services, human resources and servicing National accounts. Focus is placed on identifying and eliminating redundant or obsolete applications with an emphasis on increasing Anthem's
capability to operate in an Internet-enabled environment. Regional administration systems serving unique products and markets feed data to a combination of regional and corporate decision support
systems. These systems provide sources of information for all of Anthem's data reporting and analysis needs. 

        Anthem's
architecture calls for significant standardization of software, hardware and networking products. Enhancements are undertaken based on a defined information systems plan. This
plan, which is developed collaboratively by Anthem's technical and operating leadership, is revalidated regularly and maps out business-driven technology requirements for the upcoming
three-to-five year period. 

        Anthem
recognizes consumer demand will cause an increasing need for more of its business to be conducted electronically. Toward that end Anthem has developed several Internet-enabled
initiatives focused on improving interactions with its customers, members, providers, brokers and associates. Anthem also is improving communication and data collection through compliance with the
provisions of the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. See "RegulationRegulation of Insurance Company and HMO Business Activities" below. 

        Anthem
is also engaged in a series of pilot programs that will result in web-enabled services such as on-line membership enrollment and on-line price
quoting for brokers. Brokers will receive on-line quoting capabilities for life, dental and vision related products. For its members, Anthem has on-line access to health
information using carefully chosen content providers for consumer health information. All of its members currently have on-line access to physician and hospital network directories for
their specific health plan. 

Collaborations with Anthem  

        In addition to internal efforts to leverage technology, Anthem is actively involved as investors and leaders in several collaborative technology initiatives. As
an example, Anthem is one of seven major national health benefits companies that are initial investors in MedUnite, Inc., an e-business company. 

MedUnite is designing Internet-based technology that will permit real-time transactions between providers and insurance companies. MedUnite's solutions will address claims filing,
eligibility determination and specialist referrals. These programs will make these transactions more convenient for members while improving efficiencies among doctors, hospitals and health insurers.
Additionally, Anthem is a founding member of the Coalition for Affordable Quality Healthcare. This group, founded by 26 of the nation's largest health benefits companies and associations, develops
programs to improve access to quality health care coverage and to simplify plan administration. 

Pricing and Underwriting of Anthem's Products  

        Anthem prices its products based on its assessment of underwriting risk and competitive factors. Anthem continually reviews its underwriting and pricing
guidelines on a national and regional basis so that its products remain competitive and consistent with its marketing strategies and profitability goals. 

        Anthem
has focused its efforts to maintain consistent, competitive and strict underwriting standards. Anthem's individual and group underwriting targets have been based on its
proprietary accumulated actuarial data. Subject to applicable legal constraints, Anthem has traditionally employed case specific underwriting procedures for small group products and traditional group
underwriting procedures with
respect to large group products. Also, Anthem employs credit underwriting procedures with respect to its self-funded products. 

        In
most circumstances, Anthem's pricing and underwriting decisions follow a prospective rating process. A fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period.
Unanticipated increases in medical costs may not be able to be recovered in that current policy year. However, prior experience, in the aggregate, is considered in determining premium rates for future
periods. 

        For
larger groups (over 300 lives) with PPO, POS or traditional benefit designs, Anthem sometimes employs retrospective rating reviews. In retrospective rating, a premium rate is
determined at the beginning of the policy period. Once the policy period has ended, the actual experience is reviewed. If the experience is positive (i.e., actual claim costs and other expenses are
less than those expected), then a refund may be credited to the policy. If the experience is negative, then the resulting deficit may either be recovered through contractual provisions or the deficit
may be considered in setting future premium levels for the group. If a customer elects to terminate coverage, deficits generally are not recovered. 

        Anthem
has contracts with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS (formerly the Health Care Financial Administration, or HCFA), to provide HMO
Medicare + Choice coverage to Medicare beneficiaries who choose health care coverage through one of its HMO programs. Under these annual contracts, CMS pays Anthem a set rate based on
membership that is adjusted for demographic factors. These rates are subject to annual unilateral revision by CMS. In addition to premiums received from CMS, most of the Medicare products offered by
Anthem require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member. 

        See
"BUSINESS OF ANTHEMRegulationSmall Group Reform" below for a discussion of certain regulatory restrictions on Anthem's underwriting and pricing. 

Anthem's Reserves  

        Anthem establishes and reports liabilities or reserves on its balance sheet for unpaid health care costs by estimating the ultimate cost of incurred claims that
have not yet been reported to Anthem by members or providers and reported claims that Anthem has not yet paid. Since these reserves represent its estimates, the process requires a degree of judgment.
Reserves are established according to Actuarial Standards of Practice and generally accepted actuarial principles and are based on a number of factors. These factors include experience derived from
historical claims payments and actuarial 

assumptions to arrive at loss development factors. Such assumptions and other factors include healthcare cost trends, the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been
reported and internal claims processing charges. Due to the variability inherent in these estimates,
reserves are sensitive to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends. A worsening (or improvement) of the medical cost trend or changes in claims payment patterns
from the trends and patterns assumed in estimating reserves would trigger a change. See Note 9 to Anthem's audited consolidated financial statements included herein for quantitative information
on its reserves, including a progression of reserve balances for each of the last three years. 

Medical Management Programs of Anthem  

        Anthem's medical management programs include a broad array of activities that are intended to maintain cost effectiveness while facilitating improvements in the
quality of care provided to its members. One of the goals of these benefit features is to assure that the care delivered to its members is supported by appropriate medical and scientific evidence. 

Precertification.
 A traditional medical management program that Anthem uses involves assessment of the appropriateness of certain
hospitalizations and other medical services. For example, precertification is used to determine whether a set of hospital and medical services is being appropriately applied to the member's clinical
condition in accordance with its criteria for medical necessity as that term is defined in the member's benefits contract. 

Concurrent review.
 Another traditional medical management strategy Anthem uses is concurrent review, which is based on nationally
recognized criteria developed for the industry. With concurrent review, the requirements and intensity of services during a patient's hospital stay are reviewed, often by an onsite skilled nurse
professional in coordination with the hospital's medical and nursing staff, in order to determine whether those services are covered under a member's benefits contract. 

Disease management.
 More and more, health plans, including Anthem's, are moving away from traditional medical management approaches to
more sophisticated models built around disease management and advanced care management. These programs focus on those members who require the greatest amount of medical services. Anthem provides
important information to its providers and members to help them optimally manage the care of their specific conditions. For example, certain therapies and interventions for patients with diabetes help
prevent some of the serious, long-term medical consequences of diabetes and reduce the risks of kidney, eye and heart disease. Anthem's information systems can provide feedback to its
physicians to enable them to improve the quality of care. For other prevalent medical conditions such as heart disease or asthma, Anthem's ability to correlate pharmacy data and medical management
data allows Anthem to provide important information to its members and providers which enables them to more effectively manage these conditions. 

Formulary management.
 APM develops a formulary, a selection of drugs based on clinical quality and effectiveness, which is used across all
of Anthem's regions. A pharmacy and therapeutics committee consisting of 20 physicians, 16 of whom are academic and community physicians practicing in Anthem's markets, make pharmacy medical decisions
about the clinical quality and efficacy of drugs. Anthem's
three-tiered co-pay strategy enables members to have access to all drugs that are not covered on formulary for an additional co-pay. 

Medical policy.
 A medical policy group comprised of physician leaders from all Anthem regions, working in close cooperation with national
organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control, the American Cancer Society and community physician leaders, determines Anthem's national policy for best approaches to the application of new
technologies. 

Patient outcomes.
 A significant amount of health care expenditures are used by a small percentage of Anthem's members who suffer from
complex or chronic illnesses. Anthem has developed a series of programs aimed at helping its providers better manage and improve the health of these members. Often, these programs provide benefits for
home care services and other support to reduce the need for repeated, expensive hospitalizations. Increasingly, Anthem is providing information to its hospital networks to enable them to improve
medical and surgical care and outcomes to its members. Anthem endorses, encourages and incentivizes hospitals to support national initiatives to improve patient outcomes and reduce medication errors.
Anthem has been recognized as a national leader in developing hospital quality programs. 

External review procedures (Patients' Bill of Rights).
 In light of increasing public concerns about health plans denying coverage of
medical services, Anthem works with outside experts through a process of external review to help provide its members with timely medical care. When Anthem receives member concerns, Anthem has formal
appeals procedures that ultimately allow coverage disputes related to medical necessity decisions under the benefits contract to be settled by independent expert physicians.

Service management.
 In HMO and POS networks, primary care physicians serve as the overall coordinators of members' health care needs by
providing an array of preventive health services and overseeing referrals to specialists for appropriate medical care. In PPO networks, patients have greater access to network physicians without a
primary care physician serving as the coordinator of care. 

Anthem's Health Care Quality Initiatives  

        Increasingly, the health care industry is able to define quality health care based on preventive health measurements and outcomes of care. A key to Anthem's
success has been its ability to work with its network providers to improve the quality and outcomes of the health care services provided to its members. Anthem's ability to provide high quality
service has been recognized by the National Committee on Quality Assurance, or NCQA, the largest and most respected national accreditation program for managed care health plans. All but one of
Anthem's HMO plans in the East region hold the highest NCQA rating. Anthem's HMO plan for Colorado has received a three-year accreditation. In
Anthem's Midwest region, its Ohio HMO and POS plans hold the highest NCQA rating. Anthem expects to seek accreditation for its managed care plans in Indiana and Kentucky in 2002. 

        A
range of quality health care measures have been adopted by the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, which has been incorporated into the oversight certification by
NCQA. These HEDIS measures range from preventive services, such as screening mammography and pediatric immunization, to elements of care, including decreasing the complications of diabetes and
improving treatment for heart patients. While its results on specific measures have varied over time, Anthem is seeing continuous improvement overall in its HEDIS measurements, and a number of its
state plans are among the best performers in the nation with respect to certain HEDIS standards. 

        In
addition, Anthem has initiated a broad array of quality programs, including those built around smoking cessation and transplant management, and an array of other programs specifically
tailored to local markets. Many of these programs have been developed in conjunction with organizations such as the Arthritis Foundation and regional diabetes associations. 

Anthem's Provider Arrangements  

        Anthem's relationships with health care providers, physicians, hospitals and those professionals that provide ancillary health care services are guided by
regional and national standards for network development, reimbursement and contract methodologies. 

        In
contrast to some health benefits companies, generally Anthem's philosophy is not to delegate full financial responsibility to its providers in the form of capitation-based
reimbursement. While capitation can be a useful method to lower costs and reduce underwriting risk, Anthem has observed that, in general, providers do not positively accept the burden of maintaining
the necessary financial reserves to meet the risks related to capitation contracts. 

        Anthem
attempts to provide fair, market-based hospital reimbursement along industry standards. Anthem also seeks to ensure physicians in its network are paid in a timely manner at
appropriate rates. Anthem uses multi-year contracting strategies, including case or fixed rates, to limit trend exposure and increase cost predictability. In all regions, Anthem seeks to
maintain broad provider networks to ensure member choice while implementing effective management programs designed to improve the quality of care received by its members. 

        Depending
on the consolidation and integration of physician groups and hospitals, reimbursement strategies vary substantially across markets. Fee-for-service is
Anthem's predominant reimbursement methodology for physicians. Anthem generally uses a resource-based relative value system fee schedule to determine fee-for-service
reimbursement. This structure was developed and is maintained by CMS and is used by the Medicare system and other major payers. This system is independent of submitted fees and therefore is not as
vulnerable to inflation. In addition, physician incentive contracting is used to reward physician quality and performance. 

        Like
Anthem's physician contracts, its hospital contracts provide for a variety of reimbursement arrangements depending on the network. Anthem's hospital contracts recognize the size of
the facility and the volume of care performed for its members. Many hospitals are reimbursed on a fixed allowance per day for covered services (per diem) or a case rate basis similar to Medicare
(Diagnosis Related Groups). Other hospitals are reimbursed on a discount from approved charge basis for covered services. Hospital outpatient services are reimbursed based on fixed case rates, fee
schedules or percent of charges. To improve predictability of expected cost, Anthem frequently uses a multi-year contracting approach which provides stability in its competitive position
versus other health benefit plans in the market. 

        Anthem
believes its market share enables Anthem to negotiate favorable provider reimbursement rates. In some markets, Anthem has a "modified favored rate" provision in its hospital and
ancillary contracts that guarantees contracted rates at least as favorable as those given to its competitors with an equal or smaller volume of business. 

Behavioral Health and Other Provider Arrangements of Anthem  

        Anthem has a series of contracts with third party behavioral health networks and care managers who organize and provide for a continuum of behavioral health
services focusing on access to appropriate providers and settings for behavioral health care. These contracts are generally multi-year capitation based arrangements. Substance abuse and
alcohol dependency treatment programs are an integral part of these behavioral health programs. In addition, Anthem has recently acquired assets and retained personnel to develop its own behavioral
health networks and benefit services.

        In addition, a number of other ancillary service providers, including laboratory service providers, home health agency providers and intermediate and long-term care providers, are
contracted on a region-by-region basis to provide access to a wide range of services. These providers are normally paid on either a fee schedule,
fixed-per-day or per case basis.

Anthem's Competition  

        The health benefits industry is highly competitive, both nationally and in its regional markets. Competition has intensified in recent years due to more
aggressive marketing and pricing, a 

proliferation of new products and increased quality awareness and price sensitivity among customers. Significant consolidation within the industry has also added to competition. In addition, with the
1999 enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, banks and other financial institutions have the ability to affiliate with insurance companies, which may lead to new competitors in the insurance and
health benefits fields. 

        Industry
participants compete for customers mainly on the following factors: 


price;


quality
of service;


access
to provider networks;


flexibility
of benefit designs;


reputation
(including NCQA accreditation status);


brand
recognition; and


financial
stability. 

        Anthem
believes its exclusive right to market products under the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand in its markets provides Anthem with an advantage over its competition. In addition, Anthem's
strong market share and existing provider networks in both its Midwest and East regions enable Anthem to achieve cost-efficiencies and service levels that allow Anthem to offer a broad
range of health benefits to its customers on a more cost-effective basis than many of its competitors. In Anthem's West region, the
marketplace is highly fragmented with no single player having a dominant market share. There, as in all regions, Anthem strives to distinguish its products through excellent service, product value and
brand recognition. 

        Competitors
in Anthem's markets include local and regional managed care plans, and national health benefits companies. In its Midwest region, its largest competitors include
UnitedHealthcare, Humana Inc., Aetna U.S. Healthcare and Medical Mutual of Ohio. In Anthem's East region, its main competitors are Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Health Net, Inc., CIGNA
HealthCare, ConnectiCare, Inc. and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. In Anthem's West region, its principal competitors include Sierra Health Services, Inc., PacifiCare Health
Systems, Inc., UnitedHealthcare, Kaiser Permanente, Aetna U.S. Healthcare and Hometown Health Plan, Inc. To build its provider networks, Anthem also competes with other health benefits
plans for contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers. Anthem believes that physicians and other providers primarily consider member volume, reimbursement rates, timeliness of
reimbursement and administrative service capabilities along with the "non-hassle" factor or reduction of non-value added administrative tasks when deciding whether to contract
with a health benefits plan. At the distribution level, Anthem competes for qualified agents and brokers to distribute its products. Strong competition exists among insurance companies and health
benefits plans for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability to secure new business and maintain existing accounts. The basis of competition for the services of such agents and brokers are: 


commission
structure;


support
services;


reputation
and prior relationships; and


quality
of the products. 

        Anthem
believes that it has good relationships with its agents and brokers, and that its products, support services and commission structure compare favorably to its competitors in all
of its regions. 

Anthem's Ratings  

        Financial strength ratings are the opinions of the rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations to its
policyholders. Ratings provide both industry participants and insurance consumers with meaningful information on specific insurance companies and have become an increasingly important factor in
establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Rating agencies continually review the financial performance and condition of insurers and higher ratings generally indicate financial
stability and a strong ability to pay claims. The current financial strength ratings of Anthem Insurance and its consolidated subsidiaries are as follows: 

Rating Agency

Financial

Strength Rating

Rating Description

AM Best Company, Inc. ("Best")

A

("Excellent")

Second highest of nine ratings categories and second highest within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A and A- are "Excellent")

Standard & Poor's Rating Services ("S&P")

A

("Strong")

Third highest of nine ratings categories and mid-range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A- are "Strong")

Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's")

A2

("Good")

Third highest of nine ratings categories and mid-range within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A1, A2 and A3 are "Good")

Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch")

A+

("Strong")

Third highest of eight ratings categories and highest within the category based on modifiers (i.e., A+, A and A- are "Strong")

        These financial strength ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion as to the financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet claim obligations to policyholders. In May
2002, Best upgraded its rating to A. In April 2002, S&P reaffirmed its A rating and revised its outlook to stable, Moody's reaffirmed its rating of A2 and Fitch reaffirmed its A+ rating and
reaffirmed its outlook as positive. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Anthem believes
its strong ratings are an important factor in marketing its products to its customers, since ratings information is broadly disseminated and

generally used throughout the industry. The above ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of the financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders of
Anthem Insurance and its subsidiaries, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in Anthem's common stock.

        Anthem's senior debt is rated BBB by S&P. Anthem's 6.00% equity security units are rated BB+ by S&P.

Anthem's Investments  

        Anthem's investment objective is to preserve its asset base and to achieve rates of return, which are consistent with its defined risk parameters, mix of
products, liabilities and surplus. Anthem's portfolio is structured to provide sufficient liquidity to meet general operating needs, special needs arising from changes in its financial position and
changes in financial markets. As of March 31, 2002, fixed maturity securities accounted for 95% of total investments. Anthem's fixed maturity portfolio consists exclusively of U.S.
dollar-denominated assets, invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds and mortgage-related securities. As of March 31, 2002, Anthem's corporate fixed
maturity portfolio (approximately 40% of the total fixed maturity portfolio as of March 31, 2002) had an average credit rating of approximately double-A. Anthem's investment policy
prohibits investments in derivatives. 

        Anthem's
portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk, and market valuation risk for equity holdings. Credit quality risk is defined as
the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed income security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade. Anthem manages this risk through its investment policy, which establishes
credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as dollar limits of its investment in securities of individual issuers. Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses
on fixed-rate securities, due to an adverse change in market interest rates. Anthem manages interest rate risk by maintaining a duration commensurate with its insurance liabilities and
shareholders' equity. Market valuation risk for the equity holdings is defined as the potential for economic losses due to an adverse change in equity prices. Anthem manages these risks by investing
in index mutual funds that replicate the risk and performance of the S&P 500 and S&P 400 indices, resulting in a diversified equity portfolio. 

        For
additional information regarding Investments, refer to Note 5 to Anthem's audited consolidated financial statements included herein. 

Anthem's Employees  

        As of December 31, 2001, Anthem had approximately 14,800 full-time equivalent employees primarily located in Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; North Haven, Connecticut; Denver, Colorado; South Portland, Maine; and Manchester, New Hampshire. Employees were also located in various other cities
within its regions, as well as in Illinois and New York. Anthem's employees are an important asset, and Anthem seeks to develop them to their full potential. Anthem believes that its relationships
with its employees are good. No employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 

Anthem's Properties  

        Anthem's principal executive offices are located at 120 Monument Circle, Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition to this property, Anthem's principal operating
facilities are located in Denver, Colorado; North Haven, Connecticut; Indianapolis, Indiana; Mason/Cincinnati, Ohio; Worthington/Columbus, Ohio; Manchester, New Hampshire; Louisville, Kentucky and
South Portland, Maine. In total, Anthem owns approximately 14 facilities and leases approximately 45 facilities. These locations total 4.8 million square feet, of which Anthem occupies
4.3 million square feet, and are located in 13 states. Anthem believes that its properties are adequate and suitable for its business as presently conducted. 

Regulation  

General  

        Anthem's operations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state and federal regulation throughout the United States in the jurisdictions in which Anthem does
business. Supervisory agencies, including state health, insurance and corporation departments, have broad authority to: 


grant,
suspend and revoke licenses to transact business;


regulate
many aspects of Anthem's products and services;


monitor
Anthem's solvency and reserve adequacy; and


scrutinize
Anthem's investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria. 

        To
carry out these tasks, these regulators periodically examine Anthem's operations and accounts. 

Regulation of Insurance Company and HMO Business Activities  

        The federal government and the governments of the states in which Anthem conducts its operations have adopted laws and regulations that govern its business
activities in various ways. These laws and
regulations may restrict how Anthem conducts its businesses and may result in additional burdens and costs to Anthem. Areas of governmental regulation include: 


licensure;


premium
rates;


benefits;


service
areas;


market
conduct;


utilization
review activities;


prompt
payment of claims;


member
rights and responsibilities;


sales
and marketing activities;


quality
assurance procedures;


plan
design and disclosures;


disclosure
of medical information;


eligibility
requirements;


provider
rates of payment;


surcharges
on provider payments;


provider
contract forms;


underwriting
and pricing;


financial
arrangements;


financial
condition (including reserves); and


corporate
governance. 

        These
laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction. 

        States
generally require health insurers and HMOs to obtain a certificate of authority prior to commencing operations. If Anthem were to establish a health insurance company or an HMO in
any state where Anthem does not presently operate, Anthem generally would have to obtain such a certificate. The time necessary to obtain such a certificate varies from state to state. Each health
insurer and HMO must file periodic financial and operating reports with the states in which it does business. In addition, health insurers and HMOs are subject to state examination and periodic
license renewal. 

        There
has been a recent trend of increased health care regulation at the federal and state levels. Legislation, regulation and initiatives relating to this trend include, among other
things, the following: 


eliminating
or reducing the scope of ERISA pre-emption of state medical and bad faith claims under state law, thereby exposing health benefits
companies to expanded liability for punitive and other extra-contractual damages;


extending
malpractice and other liability for medical and other decisions from providers to health plans;


imposing
liability for negligent denials or delays in coverage;


requiring:


coverage
of experimental procedures and drugs,


direct
access to specialists for patients with chronic conditions,


direct
access to specialists (including OB/GYNs) and chiropractors,


expanded
consumer disclosures and notices and expanded coverage for emergency services,


liberalized
definitions of medical necessity,


liberalized
internal and external grievance and appeal procedures (including expedited decision making),


maternity
and other lengths of hospital inpatient stay,


point
of service benefits for HMO plans, and


payment
of claims within specified time frames or payment of interest on claims that are not paid within those time frames; 


prohibiting:


so-called
"gag" and similar clauses in physician agreements,


incentives
based on utilization, and


limitation
of arrangements designed to manage medical costs such as capitated arrangements with providers or provider financial incentives; 


regulating
and restricting the use of utilization management and review;


regulating
and monitoring the composition of provider networks, such as "any willing provider" and pharmacy laws (which generally provide that providers and
pharmacies cannot be denied participation in a managed care plan where the providers and pharmacies are willing to abide by the terms and conditions of that plan);


imposing:


payment
levels for out-of-network care, and 


requirements
to apply lifetime limits to mental health benefits with parity; 


exempting
physicians from the antitrust laws that prohibit price fixing, group boycotts and other horizontal restraints on competition;


restricting
the use of health plan claims information;


regulating
procedures that protect the confidentiality of health and financial information;


implementation
of a state-run single payer system;


imposing
third-party review of denials of benefits (including denials based on a lack of medical necessity); and


restricting
or eliminating the use of formularies for prescription drugs. 

        The
health benefits business also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations. It is uncertain
whether Anthem can recoup, through higher premiums or other measures, the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs caused by potential legislation or regulation. 

Patients' Bill of Rights  

        On August 8, 2001, the House of Representatives passed a version of the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation (an amended version of the Ganske-Dingell
bill) which would permit health plans to be sued in state court for certain coverage determinations. The current administration has indicated a willingness to pass some form of patient protection
legislation which could adversely affect the health benefits business, and, in fact, the bill adopted by the House was the result of a compromise reached by President Bush and Representative Charles
Norwood (R-GA). Under the bill a claim would be permitted for a wrongful coverage denial which is the proximate cause of personal injury to, or the death of, a patient. Medically
reviewable claims against health insurers would be tried in state court but under federal law. Patients would be required to exhaust external review before filing suit. Patients who lose an external
review decision would have to overcome a rebuttable presumption that the insurer made the correct decision. The bill caps non-economic damages at $1.5 million. Punitive damages
would be available only if insurers do not follow an external review decision and would be capped at an additional $1.5 million. The bill also limits class action lawsuits (both future suits
and pending suits where a class has not yet been certified) against health insurers under both ERISA and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to group health plans established by a
single plan sponsor. 

        The
Senate version of the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation (the McCain-Edwards bill) was passed on June 29, 2001 and contains broader liability provisions than the House bill.
The Senate bill would permit patients to sue health plans in state court over medical judgments or in federal court over contractual issues, and it would not cap damages in state courts. In federal
court, punitive damages would be allowed, up to $5 million, and there would be no limit on economic and non-economic damages. President Bush has stated that he will veto any
Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that contains liability provisions similar to the Senate bill. The House and Senate versions of the bill are expected to be
reconciled in the Conference Committee. Anthem cannot predict the provisions of the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that may emerge from the Conference Committee, if any, and whether any
Patients' Bill of Rights legislation would be enacted into law. Anthem also cannot predict what impact any Patients' Bill of Rights legislation would have on its business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

Small Group Reform  

        All of the principal states in which Anthem does business have enacted statutes that limit the flexibility of Anthem and other health insurers relative to their
small group underwriting and rating 

practices. Commonly referred to as "small group reform" statutes, these laws are generally consistent with model laws originally adopted by the NAIC. 

        In
1991, the NAIC adopted the Small Group Health Insurance Availability Model Act. This model law limits the differentials in rates carriers could charge between new business and health
insurance renewal business, and with respect to small groups with similar demographic characteristics (commonly referred to as a "rating law"). It also requires that insurers disclose to customers the
basis on which the insurer establishes new business and renewal rates, restricts the applicability of pre-existing condition exclusions and prohibits an insurer from terminating coverage
of an employer group because of the adverse claims experience of that group. The model law requires that all small group insurers accept for coverage any employer group applying for a basic and
standard plan of benefits (commonly known as a "guarantee issue law"), and provides for a voluntary reinsurance mechanism to spread the risk of high risk employees among all small group carriers
participating in the reinsurance mechanism. Representatives of Anthem actively participated in the committees of the NAIC, which drafted and proposed this model law. NAIC model laws are not applicable
to the industry until adopted by individual states, and there is significant variation in the degree to which states adopt and/or alter NAIC model laws. Some, if not all, of these rating and
underwriting limitations are present in small group reform statutes currently adopted in all of the principal states in which Anthem does business. 

Underwriting Limitations  

        In the past, insurance companies were free to select and reject risks based on a number of factors, including the medical condition of the person seeking to
become insured. Small group health insurers were free to accept some employees and reject other employees for coverage within one employer group. An insurance company was also free to exclude from
coverage medical conditions existing within a group which the insurance company believed represented an unacceptable risk level. Also, for the most part, insurance companies were free to cancel
coverage of a group due to the medical conditions which were present in that group. Additionally, a new employee seeking medical coverage under an existing group plan could be either accepted or
rejected for coverage, or could have coverage excluded or delayed for existing medical conditions. 

        The
small group health insurance reform laws limit or abolish a number of these commonly utilized practices to address a societal need to extend availability of insurance coverage more
broadly to those who were previously not eligible for coverage. Reform laws have been adopted which at a minimum generally require that a group either be accepted or rejected for coverage as one unit.
The law in all of the states in which Anthem does business now prohibits the practice of terminating the coverage of an employer group based on the medical conditions existing within that group.
(Insurers may still cancel business for a limited number of reasons.) These states also generally require "portability" of coverage, which means that an insurer cannot exclude coverage for a
pre-existing condition of a new employee of an existing employer group if that person had previously satisfied a pre-existing condition limitation period with the prior
insurer, and if that person maintained continuous coverage. Most state small group reform statutes also prohibit insurers from denying coverage to employer groups based upon industry classification. 

        All
states in which Anthem does business require the "guarantee issue" of small group policies, either through specific state law or the states' requirement to enforce a federal law, the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA. These laws require an insurer to issue coverage to any group that applies for coverage under any of the small group
policies marketed by the insurer in that state, regardless of the medical risks presented by that group. 

        Rating Limitations.
    Prior to the adoption of state rate reform laws, there was very limited regulation of the rating
practices utilized in the small group health insurance market. There was virtually no regulation of the amount by which one group's rate could vary from that of a 

demographically similar group with different claims experience, and there was no statutorily placed limit on the extent and frequency of rate increases that could be applied to any one employer
group. 

        Over
the last nine years, all of the principal states in which Anthem does business have enacted rating laws. These laws are designed to reduce the variation in rates charged to insured
groups who have favorable and unfavorable claims experience. They also limit the extent and frequency of rate increases. They do not, however, establish an appropriate base or "manual" rate level for
an insurer. Most existing rating laws also impose a limit on the extent and frequency of a group's rate increases. Also, most existing ratings laws impose a limit on the extent and frequency of a
group's rate increases. 

Small Group Statutory Reinsurance Mechanisms  

        At this time, the Connecticut, New Hampshire and Nevada (HMO only) Anthem plans are subject to involuntary assessments from state small group reinsurance
mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to provide risk-spreading mechanisms for insurers doing business in jurisdictions that mandate that health insurance be issued on a guarantee
issue basis. Guarantee issue requirements increase underwriting risk for insurers by forcing them to accept higher-risk business than they would normally
accept. This reinsurance mechanism allows the insurer to cede this high-risk business to the reinsurance facility, thus sharing the underwriting experience with all insurers in the state.
Each of Connecticut and New Hampshire subject insurance companies doing business in that jurisdiction to assessments to fund losses from the reinsurance mechanisms. Each of Indiana, Ohio and Nevada
provide voluntary reinsurance mechanisms in which the assessment is against only those carriers electing to participate in the reinsurance mechanism. Anthem has elected not to participate in these
voluntary reinsurance mechanisms. Neither Kentucky nor Maine has a small group reinsurance mechanism. 

Recent Medicare Changes  

        In 1997, the federal government passed legislation related to Medicare that changed the method for determining premiums that the government pays to HMOs for
Medicare members. In general, the new method has reduced the premiums payable to Anthem compared to the old method, although the level and extent of the reductions varies by geographic market and
depends on other factors. The legislation also requires Anthem to pay a "user fee." The changes began to be phased in on January 1, 1998 and will continue over five years. The federal
government also announced in 1999 that it planned to begin to phase in risk adjustments to its premium payments over a five-year period commencing January 1, 2000. While Anthem
cannot predict exactly what effect these Medicare reforms will have on its results of operations, Anthem anticipates that the net impact of the risk adjustments will be to reduce the premiums payable
to Anthem. Further changes proposed in the Congress to the Medicare program would create a competitive bidding system, starting in 2005, in which health plans would compete to deliver Medicare
coverage to enrollees in certain areas. Anthem cannot predict if this legislation will be enacted, or how it might affect its Medicare business. 

HIPAA and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act  

        HIPAA and its regulations impose obligations on issuers of health insurance coverage and health benefit plan sponsors. This law requires guaranteed health care
coverage for small employers having 50 or fewer employees and for individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements. It also requires guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most
employers and individuals. The law limits exclusions based on preexisting conditions for individuals covered under group policies to the extent the individuals had prior creditable coverage, and the
gap between the prior coverage and the new coverage cannot exceed certain time frames. 

        In
addition, HIPAA authorized the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, known as HHS, to issue standards for administrative simplification, as well as
privacy and security of medical records and other individually identifiable patient data. HIPAA requirements 

apply to plan sponsors, health plans, health care providers and health care clearinghouses that transmit, maintain or have maintained health information electronically (collectively referred to as
"Covered Entities"). Regulations adopted to implement HIPAA also require that business associates acting for or on behalf of these Covered Entities be contractually obligated to meet HIPAA standards. 

        Although
HIPAA was intended ultimately to reduce administrative expenses and burdens faced within the health care industry, Anthem believes the law will initially bring about significant
and, in some cases, costly changes. HHS has released two rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to certain health care transactions, including health information. The first rule
requires the use of uniform standards for common health care transactions, including health care claims information, plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan
enrollment and disenrollment, payment and remittance advice, plan premium payments and coordination of benefits, and it establishes standards for the use of electronic signatures. The new transaction
standards became effective in October 2000. Originally, almost all Covered Entities were required to comply with these standards by October 16, 2002. However, legislation was enacted in
December 2001 giving Covered Entities the option of extending their compliance date to October 16, 2003, provided that a filing is made with HHS prior to October 16, 2002. Anthem
intends to take advantage of the extension. 

        Second,
HHS has developed new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information. In general, these regulations restrict the use and disclosure of medical
records and other individually identifiable health information held or disclosed by health plans and other affected entities in any form, whether communicated electronically, on paper or orally,
subject only to limited exceptions. In addition, the regulations provide patients with significant new rights to understand and control how their health information is used. These regulations do not
preempt more stringent state laws and regulations that may apply to Anthem. The privacy standards became effective on April 14, 2001. Anthem must comply with these privacy standards by
April 14, 2003. Anthem believes the cost of complying with these new standards could be material. 

        Other
recent federal legislation includes the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which generally required insurers to provide affected customers with notice regarding how their personal health and
financial information is used and the opportunity to "opt out" of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non-public personal information with a non-affiliated third
party. These requirements were to be implemented on a state-by-state basis by July 1, 2001. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also gives banks and other financial institutions
the ability to affiliate with insurance companies, which may lead to new competitors in the insurance and health benefits fields. 

Investment and Retirement Products and Services  

        Anthem is subject to regulation by various government agencies where Anthem conducts business, including the insurance departments of Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio,
Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Colorado and Nevada. Among other matters, these agencies may regulate premium rates, trade practices, agent licensing, policy forms, underwriting and claims
practices, the maximum interest rates that can be charged on life insurance policy loans, and the minimum rates that must be provided for accumulation of surrender value. 

ERISA  

        The provision of services to certain employee health benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), a
complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor ("DOL"). ERISA regulates certain aspects of the
relationships between Anthem and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to ERISA. Some of Anthem's administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under
ERISA. In addition, some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit 

plans. Anthem provides a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. 

        In
December 1993, in a case involving an employee benefit plan and an insurance company, the United States Supreme Court ruled that assets in the insurance company's general
account that were attributable to a portion of a group pension contract issued to the plan that was not a "guaranteed benefit policy" were "plan assets" for purposes of ERISA and that the insurance
company had fiduciary responsibility with respect to those assets. In reaching its decision, the Supreme Court declined to follow a 1975 DOL interpretive bulletin that had suggested that insurance
company general account assets were not plan assets. 

        The
Small Business Job Protection Act (the "Act") was signed into law in 1996. The Act created a framework for resolving potential issues raised by the Supreme Court decision. The Act
provides that, absent criminal conduct, insurers generally will not have liability with respect to general account assets held under contracts that are not guaranteed benefit policies based on claims
that those assets are plan assets. The relief afforded extends to conduct that occurs before the date that is 18 months after the DOL issues final regulations required by the Act, except as
provided in the anti-avoidance portion of the regulations. The regulations, which were issued on January 5, 2000, address ERISA's application to the general account assets of
insurers attributable to contracts issued on or before December 31, 1998 that are not guaranteed benefit policies. The conference report relating to the Act states that policies issued after
December 31, 1998 that are not guaranteed benefit policies will be subject to ERISA's fiduciary obligations. Anthem is not currently able to predict how these matters may ultimately affect its
businesses. 

        The United States Supreme Court is presently deciding a case which should clarify whether health plans provided to employers under the Federal ERISA law must comply with laws in some 40
states which give patients the right to independent outside review of medical coverage decisions. Anthem cannot predict what that decision will be or what impact it will have on the law and
regulations with which its plans must comply.

HMO and Insurance Holding Company Laws  

        Since the demutualization, Anthem has been regulated as an insurance holding company and has been subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in
which its subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws
and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file
with those states' insurance departments certain reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition,
various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system, depending on the size
and nature of the transactions. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany
transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. 

        Additionally,
the holding company acts for the states of domicile of Anthem and its subsidiaries restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO
without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance
company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would "control" the insurance holding company. "Control" is generally defined as the direct or
indirect power 

to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of
another person. 

Guaranty Fund Assessments  

        Under insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder losses
incurred when an insurance company becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws currently provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance
underwritten within such state (with a minimum amount payable even if no premium is received). Substantially all of Anthem's premiums are currently derived from insurance underwritten in Indiana,
Kentucky, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Colorado and Nevada. 

        Under
many of these guaranty association laws, assessments against insurance companies that issue policies of accident or sickness insurance, such as Anthem, are made retrospectively and
are based (up to prescribed limits) upon the ratio of (i) the insurance company's premiums received in the applicable state over the previous three calendar years on accident and sickness
insurance to (ii) the aggregate amount of premiums received by all assessed member insurance companies over such three calendar
years on accident and sickness insurance. The guaranty fund assessments made under these acts are administered by the state's Guaranty Association, which has its own board of directors selected by
member insurers with the approval of the State Insurance Department. In general, an assessment may be abated or deferred by the Guaranty Association if, in the opinion of the board, payment would
endanger the ability of the member to fulfill its contractual obligations. The other member insurers, however, may be assessed for the amount of such abatement or deferral. Any such assessment paid by
a member insurance company may be offset against its premium tax liability to the state in question over a multiple year period (generally five to 10 years) following the year in which the
assessment was paid. The amount and timing of any future assessments, however, cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond its control. 

        While
the amount of any assessments applicable to life and health guaranty funds cannot be predicted with certainty, Anthem believes that future guaranty association assessments for
insurer insolvencies will not have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and capital resources. 

Risk-Based Capital Requirements  

        The states of domicile of Anthem's subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital, or RBC, requirements for health and other insurance companies based
on the RBC Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of insurers and HMOs, taking into account the risk characteristics of their investments and products. The RBC
Model Act sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to
an individual insurance company's business. In general, under these laws, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the Insurance Department or Insurance Commissioner, as
appropriate, of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year. 

        The
RBC Model Act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of a company's total adjusted capital (defined as the total of its statutory capital,
surplus and asset valuation reserve) to its risk-based capital. The "Company Action Level" is triggered if a company's total adjusted capital is less than 200 percent but greater
than or equal to 150 percent of its risk-based capital. At the "Company Action Level", a company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority which discusses
proposed corrective actions to improve its capital position. A company whose total adjusted capital is between 250 percent and 200 percent of its risk-based capital is
subject to a trend test. The trend test calculates the greater of any decrease in the margin (i.e., the amount in dollars by which a company's adjusted capital exceeds its risk-based
capital) between the 

current year and the prior year and between the current year and the average of the past three years, and assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year. If a similar decrease in
margin in the coming year would result in a risk-based capital ratio of less than 190 percent, then "Company Action Level" regulatory action would be triggered. The "Regulatory
Action Level" is triggered if a company's total adjusted capital is less than 150 percent but greater than or equal to 100 percent of its risk-based capital. At the
"Regulatory Action Level", the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed. The
"Authorized Control Level" is triggered if a company's total adjusted capital is less than 100 percent but greater than or equal to 70 percent of its risk-based
