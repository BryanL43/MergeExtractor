   This summary term sheet, together with the "Questions and Answers About the
Merger and the Special Meeting" on the pages following this summary term sheet,
highlight important selected information from this proxy statement relating to
our proposed merger with Medtronic's merger subsidiary. This summary term sheet
and the following question and answer section may not, however, contain all the
information that is important to you. To more fully understand the merger and
for a more complete description of the legal terms of the merger, you should
read carefully this entire proxy statement, including the information to which
we have referred you, and all of the appendices before voting on the proposed
merger agreement. We have included page references parenthetically to direct

sheet.

The Companies (pages 61 and 68)

VidaMed, Inc.
46107 Landing Parkway
Fremont, California 94538
Telephone: (510) 492-4900

   . VidaMed designs, develops, and markets a minimally invasive treatment for
     the urological condition, benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is commonly
     referred to as BPH or enlarged prostate. Over one-half of men age 50 and
     older in the United States suffer from symptomatic BPH, which if left
     untreated, can lead to other adverse medical conditions, including
     incontinence. VidaMed's patented transurethral needle ablation, or TUNA,
     procedure is designed to provide a safe, cost effective and minimally
     invasive treatment for BPH and an alternative to drug therapy and major
     surgery. VidaMed's TUNA procedure delivers low-level radio frequency
     energy directly into the prostate, resulting in tissue shrinkage and
     subsequent alleviation of symptoms associated with BPH, with minimal
     patient discomfort or sensation of heat and allowing a patient to return
     quickly to a normal life style.

     VidaMed common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market under the
     symbol "VIDA." VidaMed was organized as a California corporation in July
     1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1995.

Medtronic, Inc.
710 Medtronic Parkway, N.E.
Minneapolis, Minnesota 55432-5604
Telephone: (763) 514-4000

   . Medtronic is the world's leading medical technology company, providing
     lifelong solutions for people with chronic disease. Medtronic's primary
     products are used for bradycardia pacing, tachyarrhythmia management,
     atrial fibrillation, heart failure, coronary and peripheral vascular
     disease, minimally invasive cardiac surgery, heart valve replacement,
     extracorporeal cardiac support, spinal and neurosurgery, malignant and
     non-malignant pain, movement disorders, neurodegenerative disorders,
     medical systems for the treatment of diabetes, and ear, nose and throat
     (ENT) surgery. Medtronic's businesses operate in four units that comprise
     one reportable segment, that of manufacturing and selling device-based
     medical therapies. The four units are: Cardiac Rhythm Management;
     Vascular; Cardiac Surgery; and Neurological, Spinal, Diabetes, and ENT.

     Medtronic's common stock trades on The New York Stock Exchange under the
     symbol "MDT." Medtronic was founded in 1949, incorporated in 1957 and
     today serves physicians, clinicians and patients in more than 120
     countries worldwide. Medtronic is a Minnesota corporation.

VidaMed Acquisition Corp.
710 Medtronic Parkway, N.E.
Minneapolis, Minnesota 55432-5604
Telephone: (763) 514-4000

   . VidaMed Acquisition Corp. is a newly-formed Delaware corporation that is
     wholly-owned by Medtronic. VidaMed Acquisition Corp. was incorporated on
     December 3, 2001 in preparation for the proposed merger and has not
     conducted any business activities to date.

The Merger (page 39)

   . At the effective time of the merger, Medtronic's merger subsidiary will
     merge with and into VidaMed, and VidaMed will continue as the surviving
     corporation. The merger will occur according to the terms and conditions
     of the merger agreement, which is described in, and is attached to, this
     proxy statement as Appendix A. You should read the description of the
     merger agreement in this proxy statement under the heading "The Merger
     Agreement" and the merger agreement carefully.

   . If the merger is completed:

     . You will receive $7.91 in cash for each of your shares of VidaMed common
       stock outstanding at the time of the merger, unless you exercise and
       perfect your appraisal rights. This cash payment is referred to as the
       "merger consideration" in this proxy statement.

     . Holders of VidaMed stock options will receive for each outstanding
       option held at the time of the merger an amount in cash determined by
       multiplying (1) the excess, if any, of $7.91 over the exercise price per
       share of the option by (2) the number of shares subject to the option,
       less any amounts needed to pay any applicable withholding of income or
       payroll taxes. This cash payment is referred to as the "option
       consideration" in this proxy statement.

     . Holders of VidaMed warrants will receive for each outstanding warrant
       held at the time of the merger an amount in cash determined by
       multiplying (1) the excess of $7.91 over the exercise price per share of
       the warrant by (2) the number of shares subject to the warrant. This
       cash payment is referred to as the "warrant consideration" in this proxy
       statement.

Effects of the Merger (page 29)

   . As a result of the merger, which may be considered a "going private"
     transaction under the U.S. federal securities laws because of Medtronic's
     relationship with VidaMed:

     . VidaMed will no longer be a public company but will be a wholly-owned,
       privately-held subsidiary of Medtronic;

     . VidaMed common stock will no longer be quoted on the Nasdaq SmallCap
       Market, price quotations will no longer be available and the
       registration of VidaMed common stock, and VidaMed's reporting
       obligations, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will terminate;

     . you will no longer be a stockholder of or have any ownership interest in
       VidaMed, and therefore you will not be able to participate in any future
       earnings and growth of VidaMed, and benefit from any future increases in
       VidaMed's value; and

     . Medtronic will receive 100% of any future earnings and growth of
       VidaMed, and benefit from any future increases in VidaMed's value, but
       will also bear 100% of the risk of any future losses of VidaMed and any
       future decreases in VidaMed's value.

Vote Required (page 13)

   . The merger agreement must be approved by the holders of a majority of the
     shares of VidaMed common stock outstanding as of the record date of the
     special meeting.

   . The merger agreement is not subject to a vote of a majority of the
     "unaffiliated shares" of VidaMed common stock, which are shares that are
     not held by Medtronic, its subsidiaries or The Medtronic Foundation.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors (page 21)

   . VidaMed's board of directors (with Medtronic's board designee, Michael D.
     Ellwein, not participating in any meetings concerning, or voting on, the
     merger or the merger agreement) unanimously approved the merger agreement,
     and recommends that you vote to adopt it.

   . VidaMed's board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable
     and that the terms of the merger agreement, including the merger
     consideration of $7.91 per share, are fair to and in the best interests of
     VidaMed stockholders (other than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The
     Medtronic Foundation).

   . VidaMed's board of directors expressed no opinion as to the fairness of
     the merger to Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The Medtronic Foundation.

Reasons for the Merger (page 21)

   . In reaching its conclusion to approve and recommend the merger agreement,
     VidaMed's board of directors considered, among other factors, the
     following:

     . The per share merger consideration in relation to historical and market
       trading prices for VidaMed common stock and the fact that the merger
       consideration represents a premium of approximately 40% over the closing
       sale price for the VidaMed common stock on the day prior to the public
       announcement of the merger agreement.

     . The familiarity of the board of directors with the business, operations,
       financial condition, and prospects of VidaMed and general industry,
       economic and market conditions.

     . The process leading to the merger and the judgment of the board of
       directors and management, based upon discussions with another bidder
       that submitted a proposal to acquire VidaMed and negotiations with
       Medtronic, that the other bidder and Medtronic were the two third
       parties most likely to acquire VidaMed and the two parties most capable
       of paying, and most likely to pay, the highest price for the acquisition
       of VidaMed, and the board's belief that the merger consideration
       represented the highest price reasonably attainable for the shares of
       VidaMed common stock at this time.

     . The belief of the board of directors after going through the sale
       process that the urology industry, and in particular, the BPH market,
       would be consolidating and would become increasingly more competitive,
       and that in order to remain competitive, VidaMed would need to either
       combine with a larger, more diversified entity with greater resources or
       raise more capital to aggressively grow and expand its business, and the
       substantial risks involved in VidaMed attempting to raise more capital
       at this time, especially in light of its present size and the current
       and expected economic climate, including the current uncertainty of the
       equity markets.

     . The opinion of Banc of America Securities LLC that, as of the date of
       its opinion, and based on and subject to the matters described in the
       opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of
       view, to holders of VidaMed common stock (other than Medtronic and its
       affiliates), and the financial presentation of Banc of America
       Securities LLC in connection with that opinion.

     . The high likelihood that the merger would be completed in light of the
       fact that Medtronic and its subsidiaries own in the aggregate over 17%
       of the outstanding shares of VidaMed common stock, the experience,
       reputation and financial capabilities of Medtronic and the likelihood
       that regulatory and stockholder approval could be obtained.

     . The receipt by VidaMed of a $5 million loan from Medtronic upon
       execution of the merger agreement that would permit VidaMed to continue
       to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to the completion
       of the merger and the repayment terms of the promissory note evidencing
       this debt in the event the merger agreement is terminated.

     . The market capitalization of VidaMed, the minimal amount of analyst
       coverage for VidaMed common stock and the relatively low volume of
       trading in its common stock on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.

     . The fact that the merger agreement must be submitted to VidaMed
       stockholders for approval, which allows for an informed vote of the
       stockholders on the merits of the transaction, and may be terminated in
       the event this approval is not obtained, and the fact that appraisal
       rights are available under Section 262 of the Delaware law.

     . The fact that the merger consideration will consist entirely of cash and
       therefore will not be subject to any market risk.

     . The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including provisions
       that permit VidaMed to terminate the merger agreement to accept a
       superior proposal.

Opinion of VidaMed's Financial Advisor (page 24)

   . Banc of America Securities LLC delivered to the board of directors its
     written opinion, dated December 5, 2001, that, as of the date of its
     opinion, and based on and subject to the matters described in the opinion,
     the merger consideration paid in the merger was fair, from a financial
     point of view, to holders of VidaMed common stock (other than Medtronic
     and its affiliates).

   . This opinion is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement. We
     encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety.

Interests of VidaMed's Directors and Officers in the Merger (page 32)

   . In considering the recommendation of VidaMed's board of directors with
     respect to the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that
     some of VidaMed's directors and officers have interests in the merger or
     have certain relationships, including those referred to below, that may
     present actual or potential, or the appearance of actual or potential,
     conflicts of interest in the connection with the merger:

     . Medtronic and its subsidiaries own in the aggregate approximately 17% of
       VidaMed's outstanding common stock and Michael D. Ellwein is both a
       director of VidaMed and an officer of Medtronic;

     . excluding Michael D. Ellwein, VidaMed's directors and officers will be
       entitled to receive an aggregate of $534,229 in merger consideration and
       $16,907,851 in option consideration in the merger;

     . all of VidaMed's officers have severance agreements that will entitle
       them to benefits if they terminate their employment or are terminated
       without cause after the merger; and

     . some of VidaMed's officers will enter into employment or consulting
       agreements with VidaMed, which agreements will be effective upon
       completion of the merger.

Conditions to the Merger (page 45)

   . The obligations of VidaMed and Medtronic to complete the merger are
     subject to several conditions. For example,

     . the merger agreement must be approved and adopted by a majority of the
       outstanding shares of VidaMed common stock;

     . there must be no legal or judicial restraints or prohibitions preventing
       completion of the merger;

     . VidaMed's and Medtronic's representations and warranties in the merger
       agreement must be materially accurate;

     . VidaMed and Medtronic must have performed in all material respects all
       of their obligations under the merger agreement; and

     . the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act of 1976
       must be expired or terminated.

   . If these conditions are satisfied, the merger should be completed within
     several days after the special meeting. If these conditions are not
     satisfied, VidaMed and/or Medtronic may be able to terminate the merger
     agreement.

   . After approval of the merger agreement by VidaMed stockholders, no
     amendment or waiver (including of any condition to the merger) can be made
     that alters the merger consideration to be received for VidaMed common
     stock or that would adversely affect the rights of VidaMed stockholders,
     without their further approval.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 46)

   . The merger agreement may be terminated before the merger is completed,
     whether before or after approval by VidaMed stockholders, upon the
     occurrence of specified events.

Termination Fee (page 47)

   . VidaMed has agreed to pay Medtronic a termination fee of $13,040,000 in
     the event the merger agreement is terminated under specific circumstances.

No Solicitation (page 43)

   . VidaMed has agreed that, except as required by its fiduciary duties to
     VidaMed stockholders or as otherwise permitted in the merger agreement, it
     and its officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, counsel,
     representatives and agents will not, directly or indirectly:

     . solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate the
       making of an acquisition proposal, or offer or proposal by a third party
       other than Medtronic to acquire VidaMed;

     . engage in or knowingly encourage in any way negotiations or discussions
       concerning, or provide any confidential information regarding VidaMed
       to, any third party relating to an acquisition proposal or which it may
       reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; or

     . agree to or endorse any acquisition proposal

Security Ownership of Management (page 66)

   . VidaMed's directors and executive officers and Medtronic have indicated
     that they, VidaMed's affiliates and Medtronic's subsidiaries intend to
     vote their shares of VidaMed common stock in favor of the merger agreement.

   . As a result of these indications, approximately 17% of VidaMed's
     outstanding common stock will be voted in favor of the merger agreement.

Appraisal Rights (page 49)

   . If you do not wish to accept the $7.91 merger consideration in the merger
     and you do not vote in favor of the merger agreement, you have the right
     under Delaware law to seek a judicial appraisal of your shares to
     determine the "fair value" of your shares, in lieu of the $7.91 merger
     consideration if the merger is completed.

   . We refer you to the information under the heading "Appraisal Rights" in
     this proxy statement and to the applicable Delaware statute attached as
     Appendix C to this proxy statement for information on how to exercise your
     appraisal rights. Failure to follow all of the steps required under
     Delaware law will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.

Source of Funds (page 37)

   . The amount of funds required to fund the payment of the merger
     consideration, the option consideration and warrant consideration is
     estimated to be $326 million, which Medtronic intends to obtain from its
     working capital.

   . The merger is not conditioned upon any financing arrangements.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 35)

   . For U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be taxed on your receipt of
     the $7.91 in cash per share to the extent that the amount you receive
     exceeds your tax basis in your shares.

   . Because determining the tax consequences of the merger can be complicated,
     you should consult your tax advisor in order to understand fully how the
     merger will affect you.

Stockholder Lawsuits Challenging the Merger (page 38)

   . Four complaints have been filed in the Delaware Chancery Court against
     VidaMed, members of VidaMed's board of directors and Medtronic. These
     complaints purport to be filed by stockholders of VidaMed and include
     requests for declarations that the actions be maintained as class actions.

   . The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and unspecified
     damages and fees of attorneys and experts. The complaints allege, among
     other things, that VidaMed's directors have breached their fiduciary
     duties owed to VidaMed stockholders (other than Medtronic, its
     subsidiaries and The Medtronic Foundation) by, among other things,
     facilitating, through unfair procedures and without implementing an
     adequate sales process designed to maximize stockholder value, Medtronic's
     proposal to acquire VidaMed to the exclusion of others, for unfair and
     inadequate consideration.

   . VidaMed believes that the complaints are without merit and intends to
     vigorously contest the lawsuits.

   . The following pages present answers to some of the more commonly asked
     questions about the merger and the special meeting.

        QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING

Q: What is the proposed transaction?

A: Medtronic will acquire VidaMed through the merger of Medtronic's merger
   subsidiary with and into VidaMed. VidaMed will continue as the surviving
   corporation after the merger and will be a privately-held, wholly-owned
   subsidiary of Medtronic.

Q: What will I receive in the merger?

A: You will be entitled to receive $7.91 in cash for each share of VidaMed
   common stock you own at the effective time of the merger, unless you
   exercise and perfect your appraisal rights.

Q: What will happen to the market for VidaMed common stock after the merger?

A: At the effective time of the merger, trading in VidaMed common stock on the
   Nasdaq SmallCap Market will cease. Price quotations for VidaMed common stock
   will no longer be available and the registration of VidaMed common stock,
   and VidaMed's reporting obligations, under the Securities Exchange Act of
   1934 will terminate.

Q: Why is the board of directors recommending that I vote in favor of the
   merger agreement?

A: VidaMed's board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable and
   that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are fair to and in the
   best interests of VidaMed stockholders (other than Medtronic, its
   subsidiaries and The Medtronic Foundation). Accordingly, the board of
   directors (with Medtronic's board designee, Michael D. Ellwein, not
   participating in any meetings concerning, or voting on, the merger or the
   merger agreement because of his affiliation with Medtronic and Medtronic's
   interest in the transaction) unanimously approved the merger agreement and
   recommends that you vote to approve and adopt it. For more information, we
   refer you to "Special Factors--Background of the Merger" and
   "--Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger."

Q: What will happen to my VidaMed stock options?

A: If you own options to purchase shares of VidaMed common stock at the
   effective time of the merger, you will be entitled to receive, for each
   option, an amount in cash determined by multiplying: (1) the excess, if any,
   of $7.91 over the per share exercise price of that option, by (2) the number
   of shares subject to that option. The amount you will receive, however, will
   be reduced to the extent of any federal and state income and payroll tax
   withholding that is due.

Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the merger to me?

A: One advantage of the merger to VidaMed stockholders is that you will receive
   an immediate cash premium for your shares of VidaMed common stock that you
   may not otherwise receive in the future. The merger consideration of $7.91
   per share represents a 40% premium over the $5.67 closing sale price of
   VidaMed common stock on December 5, 2001, one day prior to the date the
   merger agreement was publicly announced. In addition, you will not bear the
   risk of any decrease in the value of VidaMed and you will be able to dispose
   of your VidaMed shares without incurring any brokerage fees. One
   disadvantage of the merger, however, is that you will not have the
   opportunity to participate in any future earnings and growth of VidaMed or
   any future increases in VidaMed's value.

Q: What are the tax consequences of the merger?

A: The exchange of your shares for cash in the merger will be a taxable
   transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable
   transaction under state, local, foreign and other tax laws. For more
   information, we refer you to 'Special Factors--Material U.S. Federal Income
   Tax Considerations." We

   encourage you to consult with your own tax advisor with any questions you
   may have on the tax consequences of the merger, especially if you own
   VidaMed stock options or warrants.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: We are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. Assuming we
   obtain stockholder approval and any required antitrust clearance, we expect
   to complete the merger within several days after the special meeting.

Q: When and where is the special meeting?

A: The special meeting of stockholders will be held on      , 2002, at  :00
   a.m., local time, at located at         .

Q: Who can vote at the special meeting?

A: Stockholders as of the close of business on       , 2002.

Q: How many shares need to be represented at the meeting?

A: The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the
   special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to
   constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If you vote by proxy
   card or in person at the special meeting, you will be considered part of the
   quorum.

Q: How do I vote?

A: You may vote by mail by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card or
   in person at the special meeting.

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my
   shares for me?

A: Generally, your broker will not have the power to vote your shares. Your
   broker will vote your shares only if you provide him or her with
   instructions on how to vote. Any failure to instruct your broker on how to
   vote in favor of the merger agreement will have the effect of a vote
   "against" the merger agreement. You should follow the directions provided by
   your broker on how to instruct your broker to vote your shares.

Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?

A: Yes. You may revoke your proxy any time before the special meeting by:

   . giving written notice of your revocation to our Secretary;

   . filing a revoking instrument or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date
     with the Secretary; or

   . attending the special meeting and voting in person.

Q: How many votes are required to approve and adopt the merger agreement?

A: Approval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote
   of a majority of the shares of VidaMed common stock outstanding as of      ,
   2002. A failure to vote or to provide your broker with instructions on how
   to vote, or a vote to abstain will have the same effect as a vote "against"
   the merger agreement.

   All of VidaMed's directors and executive officers have indicated to us that
   they and their affiliates intend to vote their shares of VidaMed common
   stock in favor of the merger agreement. In addition, Medtronic has indicated
   to us that its subsidiary intends to vote its shares of VidaMed common stock
   in favor of the merger agreement. As a result of these indications,
   approximately 17% of outstanding VidaMed common stock will

   be voted in favor of the merger agreement. Accordingly, in excess of an
   additional 33% of outstanding VidaMed common stock must be voted in favor of
   the merger agreement for its approval.

Q: What rights do I have if I oppose the proposed merger agreement?

A: If you oppose the proposed merger agreement and do not vote in favor of it
   and the merger is completed, you may dissent and seek appraisal of the fair
   value of your shares under Delaware law. You must, however, comply with all
   of the required procedures explained under the heading "Appraisal Rights" in
   this proxy statement and in Appendix C to this proxy statement.

Q: What happens if I sell my VidaMed shares before the special meeting?

A: The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of
   the merger. If you transfer your VidaMed shares after the record date, but
   before the effective time of the merger, you will retain your right to vote
   at the special meeting but the right to receive the $7.91 in cash per share
   will pass to the person to whom you transferred your shares.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: If you do not plan to attend the special meeting, please complete, date and
   sign your proxy card and then mail it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope
   as soon as possible, so that your shares may be represented at the special
   meeting.

Q: Should I send in my VidaMed stock certificates now?

A: No. Soon after the merger is completed, the paying agent will send you
   written instructions explaining how to exchange your VidaMed stock
   certificates for cash.

events and results may differ materially and are subject to risks,
uncertainties and assumptions about us. We are not obligated to publicly update
or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties

                  INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Time and Place

   This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by VidaMed's board of directors for a special meeting of stockholders
to be held on   ,   , 2002, at  :00 a.m., local time, at the .

Purpose

   At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement.

   The board of directors of VidaMed has unanimously determined that the merger
is advisable and that the terms of the merger agreement are fair to and in the
best interests of VidaMed and its stockholders (other than Medtronic, its
subsidiaries and The Medtronic Foundation) and has unanimously approved the
merger agreement and the merger (with Medtronic's board designee, Michael D.
Ellwein, not participating in any meetings concerning, or voting on, the merger
or the merger agreement because of his affiliation with Medtronic and
Medtronic's interest in the transaction). Accordingly, the board of directors
recommends that you vote "for" adoption of the merger agreement.

   In considering the recommendation of VidaMed's board of directors, you
should be aware that, as discussed in more detail under the heading "Special
Factors--Interests of VidaMed's Directors and Officers in the Merger," some of
VidaMed's directors and officers have interests in the merger or have certain
relationships that may present actual or potential, or the appearance of actual
or potential, conflicts of interest in the connection with the merger.

   To review the background and reasons for the merger in greater detail, we
refer you to the information under the heading "Special Factors--Background of
the Merger" and "--Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the
Merger."

   You may be asked to consider other matters that may properly come before the
special meeting and any postponements or adjournments of the meeting. It is not
anticipated that any other matters will be brought before the special meeting.
If other matters should properly come before the special meeting, however, the
holders of proxies solicited hereby will vote on such matters in their
discretion, unless you withhold such authority. These matters may include an
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting from time to time if
VidaMed's board of directors so determines. If any adjournment or postponement
is made and the adjournment proposal has been approved, we may solicit
additional proxies during the adjournment period.

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote

   We have fixed the close of business on     , 2002 as the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
special meeting. As of that date, there were     shares of VidaMed common stock
outstanding and eligible to vote. Each share of VidaMed common stock is
entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on at the special meeting.

Quorum Requirement

   The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of a majority of
shares of VidaMed common stock issued and outstanding and eligible to vote will
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting. In
general, shares of VidaMed common stock represented by a properly signed and
returned proxy card will be counted as shares present and entitled to vote for
purposes of determining a quorum, without regard to whether the card reflects
abstentions (or is left blank) or reflects a "broker non-vote" on a matter.

Vote Required

   Assuming a quorum is represented at the special meeting, either in person or
by proxy, the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of VidaMed common
stock outstanding as of the record date. The approval of the merger agreement
is not subject to a vote of a majority of the "unaffiliated shares" of VidaMed
common stock, which are shares that are not held by Medtronic, its subsidiaries
or The Medtronic Foundation.

   Shares represented by a proxy card voted as abstaining on the proposed
merger agreement will be treated as shares present and entitled to vote that
were not cast in favor of the merger agreement, and thus will be counted as
votes against the merger agreement.

Security Ownership of Management

   All of VidaMed's directors and executive officers have indicated to us that
they and their affiliates intend to vote their shares of VidaMed common stock
in favor of the merger agreement. In addition, Medtronic has indicated to us
that its subsidiary intends to vote its shares of VidaMed common stock in favor
of the merger agreement. As a result of these indications, approximately 17% of
VidaMed common stock outstanding as of the record date of the special meeting
will be voted in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

Broker Non-Votes

   Brokers who hold shares in street name for customers have the authority to
vote on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from
beneficial owners. These brokers, however, are precluded from exercising their
voting discretion with respect to the approval of non-routine matters, like
approving and adopting the merger agreement. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a
broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not
vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary
voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from
the beneficial owner. Properly executed broker non-votes will be treated as
shares that are present and entitled to vote at the special meeting for
purposes of determining whether a quorum exists and will have the same effect
as votes against the merger agreement.

Proxies

   This proxy statement is being mailed to our stockholders beginning on or
about     , 2002 in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of
directors for use at the special meeting.

   Your vote is important. A proxy card is enclosed for your use. You are
solicited on behalf of the board of directors, to mark, sign, date and return
the proxy card in the accompanying envelope. No postage is required if mailed
within the United States.

   Proxies will be voted as specified by you. Signed proxies that lack any
specification will be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement.

   The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the merger agreement.

Revocation of Proxies

   Any stockholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to its use at
the special meeting by:

   . giving written notice of your revocation to the Secretary of VidaMed,

   . filing a duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of
     VidaMed, or

   . appearing at the special meeting and voting in person.

Proxy Solicitation Costs

   The cost of soliciting proxies, including the preparation, assembly and
mailing of proxies and soliciting material, as well as the cost of forwarding
this material to the beneficial owners of VidaMed common stock will be borne by
VidaMed. VidaMed's directors, officers and regular employees may, without
compensation other than their regular compensation, solicit proxies by
telephone, facsimile, telegraph or personal conversation. VidaMed may reimburse
brokerage firms and others for expenses in forwarding proxy materials to the
beneficial owners of VidaMed common stock.

   VidaMed may decide to retain a proxy solicitation firm for assistance in
connection with the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting. If VidaMed
retains a proxy solicitation firm, it anticipates that the costs it will incur
will be approximately $5,000 plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

Appraisal Rights

   Stockholders on the record date who do not vote in favor of the merger
agreement, who file with VidaMed before the vote on the merger agreement a
written notice of intent to demand the fair value of their shares and comply
with the other statutory requirements of Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, will be entitled to appraisal rights. If you vote in favor of
the merger agreement, you will waive your appraisal rights. A copy of the
Delaware appraisal statute is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement
and is described in more detail in this proxy statement under the heading
"Appraisal Rights."

                                SPECIAL FACTORS

Background of the Merger

   The provisions of the merger agreement are the result of arm's length
negotiations conducted among representatives of VidaMed and Medtronic and their
respective legal and financial advisors. The following is a summary of the
meetings, negotiations, material contacts and discussions between VidaMed and
Medtronic that preceded the execution of the merger agreement, as well as any
negotiations or material contacts with other third parties concerning an
acquisition of or other business combination with VidaMed.

   Since its initial public offering in June 1995, VidaMed has regularly
considered opportunities for acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution and
licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions and has from time to
time engaged in preliminary discussions and negotiations with other companies
regarding these types of transactions, including Medtronic and another company
in the medical device business, which we refer to in this proxy statement as
the "other bidder."

   In late 1998 and early 1999, VidaMed engaged in preliminary discussions with
the other bidder regarding the possibility of the other bidder acquiring
VidaMed. In connection with these discussions, VidaMed and the other bidder
entered into a confidentiality agreement. No agreement was reached with the
other bidder, and these discussions were terminated in early 1999.

   On January 4, 2000, as part of a private placement by VidaMed of common
stock and warrants for the purpose of raising additional capital, Medtronic
purchased 5,300,000 shares of VidaMed common stock at a price of $1.73 per
share. In connection with this purchase, Medtronic was also issued warrants to
purchase an additional 1,590,000 shares of VidaMed common stock with an
exercise price of $1.80 per share. On November 16, 2000, as part of additional
capital raising efforts by VidaMed, Medtronic purchased an additional 800,000
shares of VidaMed common stock at a price of $2.00 per share. The terms of
Medtronic's investments in these financings were the same as other investors,
with the exception that Medtronic, as the largest investor in the January 2000
financing, was granted the right to designate one person to VidaMed's board of
directors. See "--Relationship Between VidaMed and Medtronic" for a more
complete description of these financing transactions.

   During the week of April 30, 2001, Randy D. Lindholm, VidaMed's Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer, received a telephone call from a
representative of the other bidder seeking an update on VidaMed's business and
operations. The other bidder also indicated that it would be interested in
meeting with Mr. Lindholm prior to the annual meeting of the American
Urological Association on June 4, 2001. On May 15, 2001, VidaMed and the other
bidder entered into a customary confidentiality agreement to permit them to
exchange additional information concerning their respective businesses and
operations.

   On May 10, 2001, VidaMed held its annual stockholders' meeting followed by
its regularly scheduled board meeting. At this board meeting, Mr. Lindholm
briefed the board members regarding his discussions with the other bidder. The
board concluded that VidaMed was not seeking a sale of the company at that time
but authorized Mr. Lindholm to continue to have discussions with the other
bidder.

   On May 25, 2001, Mr. Lindholm met with representatives of the other bidder.
At this meeting, the other bidder indicated that its strategy included growing
its urological business and that it was interested in pursuing the possibility
of a strategic relationship with VidaMed that could take a number of different
forms. Mr. Lindholm indicated his concern that the other bidder had not
seriously pursued the discussions that had taken place in early 1999. The
representatives of the other bidder assured Mr. Lindholm that new management
was in place at the other bidder and that they were committed to pursuing these
discussions.

   On June 4, 2001, Mr. Lindholm had discussions with representatives of the
other bidder at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association. At
the AUA annual meeting, Mr. Lindholm also engaged in a

preliminary discussion with Martha Goldberg Aronson, Vice President and General
Manager, Functional Stimulation, of Medtronic. During this discussion, VidaMed
and Medtronic entered into a customary confidentiality agreement and Mr.
Lindholm then provided Ms. Aronson with a summary of VidaMed's current business
and operations as well as its strategy for the office market.

   On June 19, 2001, Mr. Lindholm met with Ms. Aronson for the purpose of
enabling her to view an office procedure using VidaMed's Precision TUNA system.
On June 25-26, 2001, Mr. Lindholm met with representatives of the other bidder
for the purpose of enabling them to view multiple procedures using the
Precision system.

   On July 10, 2001, Mr. Lindholm, John F. Howe, VidaMed's Vice President,
Finance and Chief Financial Officer, and Stephen J. Williams, VidaMed's Vice
President, Operations and Chief Operating Officer, met with representatives of
the other bidder at VidaMed's headquarters. At this meeting, the
representatives of the other bidder conducted general due diligence regarding
VidaMed and its business and operations as well as a more detailed
investigation of VidaMed's financials, manufacturing and quality control.
Following this meeting, VidaMed provided the other bidder with certain
publications regarding the treatment of prostatitis using VidaMed's TUNA
system, its revised budget for fiscal year 2001 and contact information
regarding the manufacturer of the generators used in VidaMed's TUNA systems.

   On August 22, 2001, VidaMed held its regularly scheduled board meeting. At
the meeting, Mr. Lindholm briefly updated the board regarding the discussions
with the other bidder and indicated that the discussions had not progressed
beyond preliminary information gathering regarding VidaMed's business.

   On August 24, 2001, VidaMed provided Medtronic with a physician referral
list as well as analysts reports from two of VidaMed's analysts, pursuant to a
request received from Ms. Aronson of Medtronic. Over the next two weeks,
VidaMed provided to the other bidder more detailed information regarding
VidaMed's office market strategy and quality controls pursuant to requests
received from the other bidder.

   On September 18, 2001, Mr. Lindholm received a telephone call from senior
management of the other bidder. During this call, the other bidder expressed
significant concern regarding the amount of VidaMed common stock and warrants
owned by Medtronic and the fact that Medtronic had a representative on
VidaMed's board of directors. The other bidder also indicated a concern
regarding how Medtronic might react to any kind of proposal by the other
bidder. No expression of interest by the other bidder in any kind of strategic
transaction was made at this time.

   On October 15, 2001, at the request of the other bidder, VidaMed provided
the other bidder with additional physician referrals.

   On October 30, 2001, VidaMed held its quarterly conference call to discuss
its third quarter results, and representatives of the other bidder listened in
on the call. Following this call, the other bidder requested that VidaMed
provide it with reports from VidaMed's analysts that had been revised to
reflect VidaMed's third quarter results.

   VidaMed's regularly scheduled board meeting was held on November 8, 2001.
Shortly before the meeting was to commence, Mr. Lindholm received telephone
calls from senior management at the other bidder indicating that the other
bidder was interested in making a proposal to acquire VidaMed. Upon being
informed that VidaMed's board was meeting that morning, the other bidder faxed
to Mr. Lindholm a letter setting forth its non-binding, preliminary proposal to
acquire all of the fully diluted shares of VidaMed for an aggregate purchase
price of $300 million, which would be payable 50% in the other bidder's common
stock and 50% in cash. The acquisition was conditioned on satisfactory
completion of due diligence, approval of the final terms and conditions by the
other bidder's board of directors, negotiation of mutually satisfactory
definitive agreements, including agreements with VidaMed's significant
stockholders regarding their support of the transaction, and

execution of appropriate employment or retention agreements with key employees.
The preliminary proposal was made on the condition that its existence and
contents would be kept strictly confidential and disclosure to any other
parties, including any stockholders of VidaMed, would result in the immediate
withdrawal of the proposal. The proposal also stated that other companies in
the Urology market were available for purchase and therefore time was of the
essence in responding. The proposal requested a response within five business
days.

   All of the members of VidaMed's board were present at the board meeting on
November 8th, with the exception of Michael D. Ellwein, Medtronic's
representative on the board, who was unable to attend in person and would join
the meeting by telephone later. Prior to the time Mr. Ellwein was scheduled to
join the meeting by telephone, Mr. Lindholm informed the board that he had
received a written preliminary proposal from the other bidder to acquire
VidaMed. He indicated that this proposal had not been solicited and had been
delivered to him shortly before the board meeting. At that point, a
representative of Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly LLP, outside legal counsel to
VidaMed, advised the members of the board that their fiduciary duties required
that they carefully consider any bona fide acquisition proposal and act in an
informed and deliberate manner. The board then engaged in a lengthy discussion
of the other bidder's proposal. In the course of this discussion, the board
discussed factors that might lead it to consider the possibility of a sale of
the company, including the fact that VidaMed was basically a single product
company, the benefits of integrating VidaMed's operations into a larger
organization with greater resources and the potential entry of new competition.
The board also discussed the factors that might lead it not to consider such a
sale, including a failure to receive a fair price for the company, the fact
that VidaMed was just beginning to build momentum in its business and was on
the verge of reaching profitability and cash flow break even, VidaMed's limited
cash and other resources to pursue such a sale and the distractions that such a
process can entail. Following this discussion, the board authorized management
to engage an investment banker to assist the board in analyzing the adequacy
and financial aspects of the proposal.

   Mr. Ellwein then joined the meeting by telephone. Mr. Lindholm informed Mr.
Ellwein that VidaMed had received a written proposal from a third party to
acquire the company. Mr. Lindholm did not identify the third party or describe
any of the terms of the third party's proposal to Mr. Ellwein, but indicated
that the potential acquirer was credible, had the financial resources to
complete the acquisition and had proposed a price that represented a premium
over the current trading price of VidaMed's stock. Mr. Ellwein indicated that
Medtronic would probably also be interested in submitting a proposal to acquire
VidaMed. Mr. Ellwein then recused himself from the remainder of the board
meeting and indicated his intention not to participate in any further board
discussions regarding the acquisition of VidaMed.

   Following the board meeting, Mr. Lindholm engaged Banc of America Securities
LLC to act as VidaMed's exclusive financial advisor in connection with
considering the possible acquisition of VidaMed. Mr. Lindholm then contacted
senior management of the other bidder and informed them that Mr. Ellwein had
recused himself from the board meeting, that VidaMed had engaged Banc of
America Securities as its financial advisor and Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly as
its legal counsel for the transaction, and that the board would be evaluating
the proposal and would respond within the five business day period requested in
the proposal and more likely by the following Monday or Tuesday.

   On November 12, 2001, the VidaMed board convened by teleconference for the
purpose of making a preliminary evaluation of the proposal by the other bidder.
Prior to the meeting, Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly had provided the board with
a summary of the board's fiduciary duties in connection with considering an
acquisition of VidaMed, and Banc of America Securities had provided the board
with a preliminary financial analysis of the other bidder's proposal. At the
meeting, VidaMed management, legal counsel and financial advisors reviewed with
the VidaMed board the other bidder's proposal. Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly
reviewed with the VidaMed board their fiduciary duties. Banc of America
Securities presented a preliminary review of the proposal in relation to a
premium to market price, other selected publicly traded companies and
historical price performance and provided a preliminary analysis of the other
bidder. After a lengthy discussion, the VidaMed board concluded that the
proposal was attractive enough to enter into further discussions with the other
bidder. Accordingly, the VidaMed board authorized management to proceed with
due diligence and

negotiations with the other bidder regarding the terms for such an acquisition
and instructed Banc of America Securities to conduct further analysis of the
adequacy of the proposal and the likelihood that the other bidder would be
willing to increase its offer. The board also instructed Oppenheimer Wolff &
Donnelly to prepare a draft of a merger agreement to be submitted to the other
bidder's legal counsel as soon as possible.

   At the November 12th meeting, Banc of America Securities also provided the
VidaMed board with a brief overview of certain other potential strategic
partners for VidaMed. The VidaMed board then engaged in a discussion of the
likelihood that potential strategic partners other than the other bidder and
Medtronic would be interested in entering into a transaction with VidaMed. In
the course of this discussion, Mr. Lindholm indicated to the VidaMed board that
two other potential strategic partners had engaged in very preliminary
discussions with VidaMed over the prior six months but had never pursued
matters further. Following this discussion, the VidaMed board concluded that
the other bidder and Medtronic were the two companies most likely to be
interested in acquiring VidaMed at this time and the two companies most capable
of paying, and most likely to pay, the highest price.

   After the meeting on November 12, 2001, Mr. Lindholm called senior
management of the other bidder and informed them that the VidaMed board had met
and had authorized management to pursue due diligence and negotiations with the
other bidder regarding the terms of an acquisition. Mr. Lindholm requested that
the other bidder send VidaMed a list of the additional due diligence items that
they needed to review, and over the next few days the parties discussed the
timetable for completing the due diligence review and for distributing a draft
of the merger agreement.

   On November 15, 2001, Medtronic delivered to Banc of America Securities a
non-binding, expression of interest to acquire all of the outstanding equity of
VidaMed at a share price ranging from $7.00 to $9.00 per share, which would be
payable 100% in cash. The acquisition was conditioned upon satisfactory
completion of due diligence and the negotiation of mutually satisfactory
definitive agreements. Following receipt of the expression of interest, David
Adams, Director, Corporate Development for Medtronic, provided VidaMed with a
list of due diligence items that Medtronic would need to review.

   On November 16, 2001, Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly distributed a draft of a
merger agreement to legal counsel for the other bidder.

   On November 19, 2001, the VidaMed board convened by teleconference for the
purpose of making a preliminary evaluation of the indication of interest by
Medtronic and updating the VidaMed board regarding the status of the
negotiations with the other bidder. Prior to the meeting, Banc of America
Securities provided the board with a preliminary financial analysis of
Medtronic's indication of interest and a preliminary comparison of the
indication of interest by Medtronic and the proposal by the other bidder. At
this meeting, VidaMed management, legal counsel and financial advisors reviewed
with the VidaMed board Medtronic's indication of interest and the comparison of
Medtronic's indication of interest with the other bidder's proposal.
Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly reviewed with the VidaMed board members their
fiduciary duties in connection with considering Medtronic's indication of
interest and summarized the principal terms of the draft of the merger
agreement that would be used for both proposed transactions. Banc of America
Securities reviewed with the VidaMed board Medtronic's indication of interest
using both the low end and the high end of the proposed price range as well as
a comparative accretion/dilution analysis with respect to the acquiring parties
as a result of their respective proposals. After discussion, the VidaMed board
concluded that Medtronic's indication of interest was attractive enough to
enter into further discussions with Medtronic. Accordingly, the VidaMed board
authorized management to proceed with due diligence and negotiations with
Medtronic regarding the terms for such an acquisition. The VidaMed board also
instructed Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly to prepare a draft of a merger
agreement to be submitted to Medtronic's legal counsel as soon as possible.
Following the completion of the meeting, Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly
distributed a draft of a merger agreement to legal counsel for Medtronic. This
draft merger agreement contemplated that the proposed merger consideration to
be paid in the transaction would be payable 50% in cash and 50% in Medtronic
stock.

   During November 20 and 21, 2001, legal, financial and accounting
representatives of the other bidder commenced their due diligence investigation
of VidaMed. On November 21, 2001, the other bidder's legal counsel delivered
comments on the merger agreement to VidaMed's legal counsel.

   On November 26, 2001, legal and financial representatives of Medtronic
commenced their due diligence investigation of VidaMed and attended
presentations by VidaMed management.

   From November 27 through November 30, 2001, legal counsel for VidaMed and
the other bidder exchanged additional comments and continued to negotiate the
terms of the merger agreement. These negotiations focused on the structure and
mechanism for the split between cash and stock, the timing of seeking support
agreements from other VidaMed stockholders and the terms of certain provisions
designed to discourage competing higher offers that VidaMed found
objectionable, including the fiduciary out, break-up fee and termination
provisions. During this time, representatives of the other bidder continued
their due diligence of VidaMed and attended presentations by VidaMed management.

   On November 29, 2001, Medtronic's legal counsel delivered comments on the
merger agreement to VidaMed's legal counsel. On this date, Mr. Lindholm also
updated the VidaMed board members on the status of the discussions with
Medtronic and the negotiations with the other bidder.

   On November 30, 2001, Medtronic delivered to Banc of America Securities a
formal written proposal to purchase the outstanding equity of VidaMed for an
aggregate cash purchase price of $326 million. Medtronic also indicated in its
proposal that it would be willing to consider changing the consideration to
Medtronic stock if preferred by the VidaMed board. This proposal was contingent
upon satisfactory completion of certain additional due diligence items. On this
date, VidaMed requested that the other bidder convert its offer into a per
share price. The other bidder then informed VidaMed that it would offer to
purchase the outstanding equity of VidaMed for a price of $6.94 per share,
payable 50% in the other bidder's common stock and 50% in cash. At this point,
Banc of America Securities informed senior management of the other bidder that
VidaMed had received another acquisition proposal at a price significantly
higher than that proposed by the other bidder. Senior management of the other
bidder stated that the $6.94 per share price was a fair price and the highest
price that they were willing to pay and that if VidaMed did not agree to the
terms proposed by the other bidder in the merger agreement, including the
delivery of support agreements and the terms of the fiduciary out, break-up fee
and termination provisions that VidaMed found objectionable, by midnight on
that date, it would withdraw its proposal. VidaMed responded that those
conditions were not achievable, that the VidaMed board would be meeting on
Saturday to consider both proposals and the VidaMed board would consider the
other bidder's proposal on the terms most recently proposed.

   On December 1, 2001, the VidaMed board convened by teleconference to discuss
the two proposals, a summary comparison of which had been previously
distributed to the board members. At the meeting, VidaMed management, legal
counsel and financial advisors reviewed the two proposals, including the fact
that the other bidder had stated that it was withdrawing its proposal. Based on
the higher price and the more favorable terms being offered by Medtronic, the
VidaMed board authorized management to proceed with negotiations with Medtronic
for the purpose of finalizing the terms of the acquisition for presentation to
the VidaMed board. The VidaMed board instructed management to inform Medtronic
that VidaMed was interested in changing the form of consideration to Medtronic
stock rather than cash. On December 1 and 2, 2001, management and legal
representatives of VidaMed and Medtronic continued to negotiate the terms of
the acquisition.

   On December 3, 2001, Medtronic agreed to change the form of consideration to
Medtronic stock but stated that the merger would need to be structured with an
asymmetrical "collar" that would provide for an exchange ratio of Medtronic
stock to VidaMed stock that would float within a certain range in order to
ensure a fixed dollar amount to VidaMed stockholders but that would stop
floating once the upper or lower level of the range was reached, in which case
the dollar amount received by VidaMed stockholders would be less than or
greater than the original price upon announcement.

   On December 3, 2001, the VidaMed board convened by teleconference to
consider Medtronic's proposal. Prior to the meeting, Oppenheimer Wolff &
Donnelly provided the board with a summary of the terms of the merger agreement
with Medtronic, and Banc of America Securities provided the board with a
financial analysis of Medtronic's revised proposal, in each case assuming the
form of consideration to be received was Medtronic common stock. At the
meeting, Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly reviewed with the VidaMed board the
detailed summary of the merger agreement previously provided, including the
fiduciary out provisions, the break-up fee and the termination provisions, and
advised the VidaMed board regarding the legal standards applicable to the
board's consideration of the merger agreement. Banc of America Securities then
provided the VidaMed board with its financial analysis of the proposed merger.
VidaMed's legal and financial advisors then outlined for the VidaMed board the
issue raised by Medtronic regarding the requirement for a collar on the
exchange ratio. The board expressed significant concern regarding the use of
such a collar. The VidaMed board's concern centered on the fact that the collar
proposed by Medtronic was narrow and asymmetrical, which resulted in very
little price protection to VidaMed stockholders should the price of Medtronic
stock drop before completion of the merger but provided greater protection to
Medtronic should the price increase prior to the completion of the merger.
VidaMed's representatives informed the VidaMed board that Medtronic was not
willing to eliminate or change the terms of the collar. After lengthy
discussion, the VidaMed board concluded that the use of such a collar was too
risky to VidaMed stockholders and that the merger should therefore be converted
back into a cash deal. VidaMed's legal counsel and financial advisor then
provided the VidaMed board with an analysis if the merger is structured as an
all cash transaction. Following this discussion, the VidaMed board authorized
management to proceed to negotiate the terms of a cash merger with Medtronic
and to inform Medtronic of this decision.

   On December 4, 2001, the Medtronic board of directors approved the cash
merger, subject to final negotiations by senior management, and authorized
Medtronic's officers to undertake all acts necessary or advisable to effect the
Merger.

   On December 4 and 5, 2001, representatives of VidaMed and Medtronic
finalized the terms of the merger agreement. The parties agreed that the
aggregate purchase price would be $326 million, which would convert into $7.91
per share.

   On December 5, 2001, the VidaMed board convened by teleconference to
consider the merger agreement. Prior to the meeting, Oppenheimer Wolff &
Donnelly provided the board with a revised summary of the terms of the merger
agreement to reflect the change in consideration to cash and certain other
final changes agreed to by the parties, and Banc of America Securities provided
the VidaMed board with a financial analysis of the merger. At the meeting,
Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly provided the VidaMed board with a detailed summary
of the revised merger agreement, and advised the VidaMed board regarding the
legal standards applicable to their consideration of the merger agreement. Banc
of America Securities then provided the VidaMed board with their financial
analysis of the proposed merger. Banc of America Securities delivered to the
VidaMed board Banc of America Securities' oral opinion, which opinion was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 5, 2001,
that, as of that date, and based on and subject to the matters described in the
opinion, the $7.91 per share in cash to be received by VidaMed stockholders in
the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to VidaMed stockholders
(other than Medtronic and its affiliates). After lengthy discussion of the
terms of the merger agreement, including the price and the form of
consideration, the VidaMed board determined that the merger was advisable and
the terms of the merger agreement and the merger were fair to and in the best
interests of VidaMed stockholders (other than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and
The Medtronic Foundation). The board unanimously, with Michael D. Ellwein
recused and not present, approved the merger agreement and recommended that it
be submitted to VidaMed stockholders for their approval.

   Later that evening, on December 5, 2001, VidaMed, Medtronic and Medtronic's
merger subsidiary signed the merger agreement.

   On December 6, 2001, prior to the open of trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market, VidaMed and Medtronic each issued a press release announcing the
execution of the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger

   In arriving at its determination that the merger is advisable and that the
terms of the merger agreement and merger are fair to and in the best interests
of VidaMed stockholders (other than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The
Medtronic Foundation), the board of directors considered a number of factors,
including without limitation, the following:

   . The per share merger consideration in relation to historical and market
     trading prices for VidaMed common stock and the fact that the merger
     consideration represents a premium of approximately:

     . 35.9% over the closing sale price of VidaMed common stock on November
       30, 2001;

     . 35.2% over the average closing sale price of VidaMed common stock for
       the one week period ending on November 30, 2001;

     . 36.6% over the average closing sale price of VidaMed common stock for
       the one month period ending on November 30, 2001;

     . 60.9% over the average closing sale price of VidaMed common stock for
       the three month period ending on November 30, 2001; and

     . 59.6% over the average closing sale price of VidaMed common stock for
       the one year period ending on November 30, 2001.

The board noted that the closing sale price of VidaMed common stock was lower
on the day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement than on
November 30, 2001 and that the merger consideration represents a premium of
approximately:

     . 39.5% over the closing sale price of VidaMed common stock on December 5,
       2001, the day prior to the public announcement of the merger agreement;

     . 37.5% over the average closing sale price of VidaMed common stock for
       the one week period ending on December 5, 2001;

     . 35.3% over the average closing sale price of VidaMed common stock for
       the one month period ending on December 5, 2001;

     . 59.3% over the average closing sale price of VidaMed common stock for
       the three month period ending on December 5, 2001; and

     . 58.4% over the average closing sale price of VidaMed common stock for
       the one year period ending on December 5, 2001.

   . The familiarity of the board of directors with the business, operations,
     financial condition, and prospects of VidaMed and general industry,
     economic and market conditions, including the inherent risks and
     uncertainties in VidaMed's business, in each case on a historical, current
     and prospective basis.

   . The process leading to the merger and the judgment of VidaMed's board of
     directors and management, based upon discussions with the other bidder and
     negotiations with Medtronic, that the other bidder and Medtronic were the
     two third parties most likely to acquire VidaMed and the two parties most
     capable of paying, and most likely to pay, the highest price, and the
     board's belief that the merger consideration represented the highest price
     reasonably attainable for the shares of VidaMed common stock at this time.

   . The belief of the board of directors after going through the sale process
     that the urology industry, and in particular, the BPH market, would be
     consolidating and becoming increasingly more competitive, and that in
     order to remain competitive, VidaMed, as a single product company, would
     need either to combine with a larger, more diversified entity with greater
     resources or raise more capital to aggressively grow and expand its
     business, and the risks involved in VidaMed attempting to raise more
     capital at this time, especially in light of its present size and the
     current and expected economic climate, including the current uncertainty
     of the equity markets.

   . The opinion of Banc of America Securities LLC that, as of the date of its
     opinion, and based on and subject to the matters described in the opinion,
     the merger consideration provided for in the merger was fair, from a
     financial point of view, to holders of VidaMed common stock (other than
     Medtronic and its affiliates), and the financial presentation of Banc of
     America Securities LLC in connection with that opinion.

   . The high likelihood that the merger would be completed in light of the
     fact that Medtronic and its subsidiaries own in the aggregate
     approximately 17% of the outstanding shares of VidaMed common stock, the
     experience, reputation and financial capabilities of Medtronic and the
     likelihood that regulatory and stockholder approval could be obtained.

   . The receipt by VidaMed of a $5 million loan from Medtronic upon execution
     of the merger agreement that would permit VidaMed to continue to operate
     its business in the ordinary course prior to the completion of the merger
     and the repayment terms of the promissory note evidencing this debt in the
     event the merger agreement is terminated.

   . The market capitalization of VidaMed, the minimal amount of analyst
     coverage for VidaMed common stock and the relatively low volume of trading
     in its common stock on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.

   . The fact that the merger agreement must be submitted to VidaMed
     stockholders for approval, which allows for an informed vote of the
     stockholders on the merits of the transaction, and that the merger
     agreement may be terminated in the event this approval is not obtained,
     and the fact that appraisal rights are available under Section 262 of the
     Delaware law.

   . The fact that the merger consideration to be received by VidaMed
     stockholders in the merger will consist entirely of cash, and therefore,
     will not be subject to any market risk associated with the price of
     VidaMed's or Medtronic's stock prior to the merger.

   . The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including provisions
     that (a) permit VidaMed and its representatives to furnish information or
     data relating to VidaMed to, and participate in negotiations with, any
     third party making an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal
     provided (i) the board of directors reasonably believes that such
     acquisition proposal may constitute a superior proposal and (ii) the
     failure of the board to take action would constitute a breach of the
     board's fiduciary duty to shareholders, and (b) permit VidaMed to
     terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, subject to
     (i) VidaMed intending to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
     the transactions contemplated by such superior proposal immediately
     following such termination, (ii) the board of directors having given
     Medtronic at least five business days prior written notice of its
     determination to terminate the merger agreement and having afforded
     Medtronic a reasonable opportunity within such five business day period to
     amend the merger agreement to be at least as favorable to VidaMed
     stockholders as the superior proposal and (iii) payment of a $13,040,000
     termination fee.

   . While the termination fee provision of the merger agreement could tend to
     discourage alternative proposals for a business combination with VidaMed,
     the view of the board of directors and its financial advisor that this
     provision would not preclude bona fide alternative proposals and that the
     termination fee was a requirement to reaching an agreement with Medtronic
     and the amount of the termination fee was reasonable in light of the size
     and benefits of the merger.

   . The proposed structure of the merger and the fact that there is no
     financing condition to the merger or any condition based on due diligence
     or fluctuations in general or VidaMed common stock prices.

   . The recommendation of VidaMed's management with respect to the proposed
     transaction.

   VidaMed's board of directors also identified and considered a number of
uncertainties, risks and negative factors in its deliberations concerning the
merger, including the following:

   . Following the merger, VidaMed stockholders will cease to participate in
     any future earnings and growth of VidaMed and will cease to benefit from
     any future increases in the value of VidaMed. In this regard,

     the board of directors also considered that if management's accelerated
     case financial projections prepared in connection with the proposed merger
     are realized, VidaMed common stock could increase in value.

   . VidaMed stockholders may recognize a taxable gain upon completion of the
     merger if and to the extent the amount of cash they receive in the merger
     exceeds their tax basis in their shares of VidaMed common stock.

   . The possibility that the merger may not be completed and the effect of an
     abandoned merger on VidaMed's sales and operating results, and its ability
     to attract and retain new customers and attract and retain key sales,
     marketing, technical, and management personnel.

   . The risk that the announcement of the merger and the efforts necessary to
     complete the merger could result in a disruption in the operations of
     VidaMed by, among other things, diverting management and other resources
     of VidaMed from its day to day business and the risk that key personnel
     may choose not to remain employed with VidaMed after the merger.

   . The fact that, if VidaMed were to exercise its right to terminate the
     merger agreement in connection with the receipt of a superior proposal, a
     $13,040,000 termination fee would become payable by VidaMed to Medtronic
     which may prevent others from making an acquisition proposal that may be
     more advantageous to VidaMed stockholders.

   . The risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger as described
     above may not be fully realized, if at all.

   . The potential conflicts of interest of VidaMed's directors and officers in
     connection with the merger, as described in more detail in this proxy
     statement under the heading "--Interests of VidaMed's Directors and
     Officers in the Merger."

   The foregoing list of factors considered by VidaMed's board of directors is
not intended to be exhaustive. The foregoing discussion addresses the material
information and factors considered by VidaMed's board of directors in its
consideration of the merger, including factors that support the merger as well
as those that may weigh against it.

   In view of the variety of factors and the amount of information considered,
the board of directors did not find it practicable to and did not specifically
make assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to all of
the various factors and analyses considered in reaching its determination. In
addition, individual members of the board of directors may have given different
weights to different factors. The board of directors did, however, give special
consideration to the premium to be paid by Medtronic in relation to current and
historical market prices of VidaMed common stock. Although the per share merger
consideration was in excess of current book value of VidaMed common stock,
which was $0.24 per share as of September 30, 2001, the board of directors did
not consider this factor particularly relevant.

   In determining whether to approve and recommend the merger agreement, the
board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, appraise the
assets of VidaMed to determine a liquidation value of VidaMed. The board of
directors believes that VidaMed's liquidation value would likely be
significantly lower than the valuation of VidaMed's business as a going
concern, and as such would not provide a useful comparison for assessing the
fairness of the merger consideration. In that regard, the board of directors
noted that Banc of America Securities LLC, its financial advisor, had not
considered liquidation value and had assessed the value of the business on the
assumption that the business would continue as a going concern.

   The board of directors also did not consider the prices paid by Medtronic or
any of its subsidiaries or any of VidaMed's affiliates in connection with
purchases of VidaMed common stock during the last two fiscal years, because it
did not believe that the prices of these purchases would provide a useful
comparison since they were at then current market prices which are
significantly below the merger consideration price.

   The board of directors considered the fact that the $7.91 price to be
received by VidaMed stockholders in the merger exceeded or was close to the
high end of the range for all of the valuation methodologies employed by Banc
of America Securities, except the discounted cash flow analysis that assumed
management's accelerated case financial projections, in which case the price
was in the middle of the range.

   In concluding that the terms of the merger agreement and merger are fair to
and in the best interests of VidaMed stockholders (other than Medtronic, its
subsidiaries and The Medtronic Foundation), the board of directors was aware
that the $7.91 price to be received by VidaMed stockholders in the merger
represents a slight discount to $7.95, the highest sale price of VidaMed common
stock during the prior 52 weeks. The board of directors, however, also noted
that the $7.91 merger consideration represents a 395% premium to $2.00, the
lowest sale price of VidaMed common stock during the prior 52 weeks.

   Despite the fact that the merger with Medtronic's merger subsidiary may be
considered a "going private" transaction under U.S. federal securities laws,
the board of directors believes that sufficient procedural safeguards were
present to ensure the fairness of the transaction and to permit the board of
directors to effectively represent the interests of VidaMed stockholders (other
than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The Medtronic Foundation). The board of
directors reached this conclusion in view of, among other things:

   . the fact that the other bidder initiated the sale process of VidaMed, not
     Medtronic;

   . the fact that Medtronic's board designee, Michael D. Ellwein, because of
     his affiliation with Medtronic and Medtronic's interest in the
     transaction, did not participate in or attend any board of directors
     meetings at which the merger agreement or merger was discussed and
     abstained from any vote on the merger agreement;

   . the fact that the board of directors unanimously approved the merger
     agreement (with Michael D. Ellwein recused and not present) and that all
     of the members of the board were disinterested in the transaction, since
     none of them has an interest in or will be directors or investors in
     VidaMed after the merger;

   . the negotiation by the board of directors with both Medtronic and the
     other bidder;

   . the fact that the board of directors engaged in extensive deliberations
     regarding the merger during the period from November 8, 2001 through
     December 5, 2001 and held seven meetings during this period;

   . the retention by the board of directors of a financial advisor and the
     receipt by the board of directors of an opinion from the financial advisor
     regarding the fairness from a financial point of view of the merger
     consideration to be received by VidaMed stockholders (other than Medtronic
     and its affiliates); and

   . the availability of appraisal rights under Delaware law for VidaMed
     stockholders who believe the terms of the merger are unfair.

   The board of directors noted that the merger agreement was approved by all
of the directors of VidaMed who are not employees of VidaMed and that these
non-employee directors believed that there was no need for them to (i) retain
any additional unaffiliated representative to act on behalf of VidaMed's
unaffiliated stockholders, (ii) require the approval of at least a majority of
VidaMed's unaffiliated stockholders, (iii) grant to unaffiliated stockholders
access to corporate files; or (iv) obtain counsel or appraisal services for
unaffiliated stockholders at VidaMed's expense. The board took these factors
into account in its assessment of the fairness of the transaction. The board
determined that, in light of the factors described above, sufficient procedural
safeguards were in place to ensure the fairness of the transaction.

Opinion of VidaMed's Financial Advisor

   On November 8, 2001, VidaMed retained Banc of America Securities LLC to act
as its financial advisor in connection with the merger and to evaluate the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of VidaMed common stock of
the merger consideration provided for in the merger. Banc of America Securities
is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and regularly engages
in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed

and unlisted securities and private placements and for estate, corporate and
other purposes. VidaMed selected Banc of America Securities to act as its
financial advisor on the basis of Banc of America Securities' experience and
expertise in transactions similar to the merger and its reputation in, and
familiarity with, the healthcare industry.

   On December 5, 2001, at a meeting of VidaMed's board of directors held to
evaluate the merger, Banc of America Securities delivered to VidaMed's board of
directors its oral opinion, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated December 5, 2001, that, as of that date,
and based on and subject to the matters described in the opinion, the merger
consideration provided for in the merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to holders of VidaMed common stock (other than Medtronic and its
affiliates).

   The full text of Banc of America Securities' written opinion to VidaMed's
board of directors which sets forth, among other things, the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken, is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement, and is
incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. Holders of VidaMed common
stock are encouraged to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its
entirety. The following summary of Banc of America Securities' opinion is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

   Banc of America Securities' opinion is addressed only to VidaMed's board of
directors and relates only to the fairness of the merger consideration provided
for in the merger, from a financial point of view, to holders of VidaMed common
stock (other than Medtronic and its affiliates). Banc of America Securities'
opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger or any related
transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to
how the stockholders of VidaMed should vote at the stockholders' meeting held
in connection with the merger. In furnishing its opinion, Banc of America
Securities does not admit that it is an expert within the meaning of the term
"expert" as used in the Securities Act, nor does Banc of America Securities
admit that its opinion constitutes a "report" or "valuation" within the meaning
of the Securities Act. Statements to this effect are included in Banc of
America Securities' opinion.

   In arriving at its opinion, Banc of America Securities:

   . reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
     business and financial information of VidaMed and Medtronic;

   . reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
     operating data concerning VidaMed;

   . analyzed certain financial forecasts prepared by the management of VidaMed;

   . discussed the past and current operations, financial condition and
     prospects of VidaMed with senior executives of VidaMed;

   . reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for VidaMed common stock;

   . compared the financial performance of VidaMed and the prices and trading
     activity of VidaMed common stock with that of certain other publicly
     traded companies which Banc of America Securities deemed relevant;

   . compared certain financial terms of the merger to financial terms, to the
     extent publicly available, of certain other business combination
     transactions which Banc of America Securities deemed relevant;

   . participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
     VidaMed and Medtronic and their financial and legal advisors;

   . reviewed the December 3, 2001 draft of the merger agreement and certain
     related documents; and

   . performed other analyses and considered other factors as Banc of America
     Securities deemed appropriate.

   Banc of America Securities did not assume any responsibility for verifying
the accuracy or completeness of any of the financial or other information
(including the information listed above) that it reviewed for purposes of its
opinion. Instead, Banc of America Securities relied on the assumption that such
information was accurate and complete. Banc of America Securities also made the
following assumptions without independent verification or investigation:

   . that the financial forecasts for VidaMed have been reasonably prepared on
     bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
     judgments of the future financial performance of VidaMed;

   . that the definitive merger agreement is identical in all material respects
     to the December 3, 2001 draft merger agreement reviewed by Banc of America
     Securities; and

   . that the merger will be completed as provided in the December 3, 2001
     draft merger agreement reviewed by Banc of America Securities, with full
     satisfaction of all covenants and conditions and without any waivers
     thereof.

   In addition, Banc of America Securities was not requested by VidaMed to
make, and did not make or receive, any independent valuation or appraisal of
the assets or liabilities of VidaMed. Banc of America Securities was not
requested to solicit, nor did it solicit, any expressions of interest from any
parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of VidaMed or any
alternative transaction.

   Banc of America Securities' opinion was necessarily based on financial,
economic, market and other conditions in effect on, and the information made
available to it as of, the date of its opinion. Banc of America Securities
expressly disclaimed any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion
to reflect any developments following the date of its opinion.

   The following summary is merely a summary of the analyses and examinations
that Banc of America Securities considered to be material to its opinion. It is
not a comprehensive description of all analyses and examinations actually
conducted by Banc of America Securities. The preparation of a fairness opinion
is a complex process involving the application of subjective business judgment
in various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances. Therefore, the preparation of a fairness opinion is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Banc of America Securities made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it considered.
Accordingly, Banc of America Securities believes that selecting portions of its
analyses and factors considered or focusing on the information presented in
tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative
description of the analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinion. Banc of America Securities did not assign
any specific weight to any of the analyses described below. The fact that any
specific analysis has been referred to in the summary below is not meant to
indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis.
Accordingly, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
described below should not be interpreted as Banc of America Securities' view
of the actual value of VidaMed.

   In performing its analyses, Banc of America Securities considered industry
performance, regulatory, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of VidaMed
and Medtronic. The estimates contained in Banc of America Securities' analyses
and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not
necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or
values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested
by the analyses. The analyses were prepared solely as part of Banc of America
Securities' analysis of the financial fairness of the merger consideration and
were provided to the board of directors of VidaMed in connection with the
delivery of Banc of America Securities' opinion. The analyses relating to the
value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or
to reflect the prices at which companies or businesses might actually be sold
or the prices at which any securities may trade at any time in the future.
Accordingly, the analyses and estimates used by Banc of America Securities in
arriving at its opinion are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

   Historical Stock Trading Analysis. Banc of America Securities reviewed the
average closing price for shares of VidaMed common stock for the one week, one
month, three month and one year periods ending on November 30, 2001 and the
closing price of VidaMed common stock on November 30, 2001. This analysis

indicated that the consideration of $7.91 in cash per share of VidaMed common
stock to be received by holders of VidaMed common stock in the merger
represented:

   . a premium of 35.9% to the closing sale price of VidaMed common stock on
     November 30, 2001;

   . a premium of 35.2% to the average closing sale price of VidaMed common
     stock for the one week period ending on November 30, 2001;

   . a premium of 36.6% to the average closing sale price of VidaMed common
     stock for the one month period ending on November 30, 2001;

   . a premium of 60.9% to the average closing sale price of VidaMed common
     stock for the three month period ending on November 30, 2001; and

   . a premium of 59.6% to the average closing sale price of VidaMed common
     stock for the one year period ending on November 30, 2001.

   Analysis of Selected Public Companies. Banc of America Securities compared
selected financial, operating and stock market data of VidaMed to corresponding
data of the following publicly traded companies in the medical products
industry:

                                Urologix, Inc.
                                Endocare, Inc.
                    American Medical Systems Holdings, Inc.
                                Medtronic, Inc.
                              Abbott Laboratories
                            Boston Scientific Corp.
                               Johnson & Johnson
                            Tyco International Ltd.

   These companies were chosen for comparison because they are publicly traded
companies which Banc of America Securities considered relevant for purposes of
its analysis; these companies are either focused on urology products or are
diversified medical product companies that offer urology products. Based on
public and other available information for each company, Banc of America
Securities calculated aggregate value, which Banc of America Securities defined
as diluted equity market value, plus total debt, less cash and cash
equivalents, as a multiple of estimated revenue for calendar years 2002 and
2003. Banc of America Securities also compared price to earnings (P/E)
multiples using estimated earnings per share for calendar year 2003.

   Equity values were calculated based on closing stock prices on November 30,
2001. Estimated financial data for the selected comparable companies were based
on selected Wall Street research analyst estimates with respect to calendar
year 2002 and 2003 revenue and Wall Street research analyst consensus estimates
with respect to 2003 earnings per share. This analysis indicated the ranges and
medians for these three multiples for the eight selected public companies as
set forth below, and Banc of America Securities compared this information to
the corresponding multiples for VidaMed.

                                         Aggregate Value as a Multiple of:
                                         ---------------------------------
                                         Calendar Year       Calendar Year

                                         -------------       ------------- --------------

High....................................    10.53x               7.09x         28.7x
Low.....................................     3.90x               3.53x         12.7x
Median..................................     5.10x               4.25x         22.6x
VidaMed.................................     8.53x               4.49x         15.3x

Medtronic/VidaMed Transaction Multiples:
Management Base Case....................    11.73x               6.79x         27.6x
Management Accelerated Case.............    10.61x               5.85x         22.3x

   Banc of America Securities then applied a range of selected multiples of
estimated revenue for calendar years 2002 and 2003 and estimated earnings per
share for calendar year 2003 derived from the selected companies to
corresponding financial data of VidaMed from two sets of financial projections
prepared by VidaMed's management. This analysis indicated an implied per share
equity reference range for VidaMed of $3.61 to $7.17 based on the base case
financial projections of VidaMed's management (the "Management Base Case") and
$3.95 to $8.86 based on the accelerated case financial projections of VidaMed's
management, which used more accelerated operating assumptions (the "Management
Accelerated Case"), as compared to the $7.91 per share merger consideration.
Banc of America Securities noted that the $7.91 per share merger consideration
implied transaction multiples as set forth in the table above.

   Analysis of Selected Acquisitions. Using publicly available information,
Banc of America Securities reviewed the purchase prices and implied transaction
multiples for eight acquisition transactions in the medical device industry
announced since November 1998 as well as a median multiple for a broader
selected universe of acquisition transactions for the medical device industry
announced since January 1998. The eight selected comparable transactions are as
follows:

Announcement Date        Acquiror                       Target
- ----------------- ----------------------- -----------------------------------
11/02/98          Medtronic, Inc.         Sofamor Danek Group, Inc.
11/30/98          Medtronic, Inc.         Arterial Vascular Engineering, Inc.
07/08/99          Abbott Laboratories     Perclose, Inc.
08/23/99          Tyco International Ltd. General Surgical Innovations, Inc.
08/27/99          Medtronic, Inc.         Xomed Surgical Products, Inc.
08/30/99          Guidant Corp.           CardioThoracic Systems, Inc.
08/07/00          Jomed N.V.              EndoSonics Corp.
06/29/01          Boston Scientific Corp. Cardiac Pathways Corp.

   These transactions were selected from a broader list of relatively recent
acquisitions in the medical device industry because Banc of America Securities
believed the acquired company has similar operating characteristics to those of
VidaMed or because Medtronic was the acquiror.

   Banc of America Securities reviewed the aggregate value of the target in
each of these eight acquisitions as of the announcement of the transaction,
which Banc of America Securities defined as diluted equity market value at the
purchase price, plus total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, as a multiple
of revenue for the latest twelve months for which data was publicly available
at the time of the announcement of the transaction ("LTM Revenue"). Based on
these calculations, Banc of America Securities noted the ranges for, and median
of the multiples in each of, the selected acquisitions and the median in the
broader medical device acquisition transaction universe, as summarized in the
following table.

                                                                   Aggregate Value at
                                                                     Announcement of
                                                                 Transaction as Multiple
                                                                     of LTM Revenue
                                                                 -----------------------

High for Eight Selected Transactions............................         14.99x
Median for Eight Selected Transactions..........................          9.01x
Low for Eight Selected Transactions.............................          3.83x
Median for Broader Medical Device Acquisition Universe..........          3.58x

Medtronic/VidaMed Transaction Multiple..........................         23.29x

   Banc of America Securities then applied a range of selected multiples to LTM
Revenue derived from the comparable transactions to VidaMed's management's
estimates of VidaMed's calendar year 2001 revenue. This analysis indicated an
implied per share equity reference range for VidaMed of $2.99 to $5.24, as
compared to the $7.91 per share merger consideration. Banc of America
Securities noted that the $7.91 per share merger consideration implied a
transaction multiple as set forth in the table above. All multiples for the
selected transactions were derived from financial information publicly
available at the time of the announcement of the relevant transaction.

   No company, transaction or business used in the selected public companies
and the selected acquisitions comparisons is identical to VidaMed or the
merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and
other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values
of the companies, business segments or transactions to which VidaMed and the
merger are being compared.

   Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Banc of America Securities performed a
discounted cash flow analysis in order to estimate the present value of the sum
of VidaMed's estimated future stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows
plus its terminal value, which was derived from estimated calendar year 2006
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) with
implied multiples ranging from 12.5x to 17.5x. Banc of America Securities
performed its analysis for VidaMed using two scenarios, the Management Base
Case and the Management Accelerated Case. Cash flows were discounted at rates
ranging from 15.0% to 25.0%. This analysis indicated an implied per share
equity reference range for VidaMed of $4.30 to $8.08 based on the Management
Base Case and $5.46 to $10.40 based on the Management Accelerated Case, as
compared to the $7.91 per share merger consideration.

   The type and amount of the merger consideration were determined through
negotiations between Medtronic and VidaMed and were approved by VidaMed's board
of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that
of VidaMed's board of directors. Banc of America Securities' opinion and the
financial analyses described above were only one of a number of factors
considered by VidaMed's board of directors in its evaluation of the merger and
should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the board of directors of
VidaMed or its management with respect to the merger or the merger
consideration.

   Under an engagement letter dated November 8, 2001, VidaMed has agreed to pay
Banc of America Securities for its financial advisory services in connection
with the merger a fee equal to 0.75% of the aggregate merger consideration (or
a total of $2.445 million) upon completion of the merger. The board of
directors of VidaMed was aware of the contingent nature of this fee structure
and took it into account in considering Banc of America Securities' opinion and
in approving the merger. VidaMed has also agreed to reimburse Banc of America
Securities for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees
and expenses of Banc of America Securities' legal counsel, and to indemnify
Banc of America Securities and related parties against liabilities, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

   Banc of America Securities and its affiliates have in the past performed
certain financial advisory and financing services for Medtronic and have
received customary fees for those services. Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate
of Banc of America Securities, is an agent and lender under Medtronic's senior
credit facility. In the ordinary course of business, Banc of America Securities
and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities of
Medtronic and VidaMed for their own accounts and for the accounts of customers
and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in those
securities.

Effects of the Merger

   Legal Effects under Delaware Law. At the effective time of the merger,
Medtronic's merger subsidiary will merge with and into VidaMed and VidaMed will
continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Medtronic under a new name, Medtronic VidaMed, Inc. As the surviving
corporation after the merger, VidaMed will have all the property, rights and
powers of VidaMed and Medtronic's merger subsidiary before the merger, and it
will be liable for all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of VidaMed and
Medtronic's merger subsidiary before the merger. After the merger, the separate
corporate existence of Medtronic's merger subsidiary will cease.

   Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
certificate of incorporation of VidaMed immediately before the merger will be
amended at the effective time of the merger to read as set forth

in Exhibit A to the merger agreement. The bylaws of Medtronic's merger
subsidiary in effect immediately before the merger will become the surviving
corporation's bylaws immediately after the merger.

   Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors of
Medtronic's merger subsidiary immediately before the merger will become the
directors of the surviving corporation and the executive officers of VidaMed
immediately before the merger will become the executive officers of the
surviving corporation immediately after the merger.

   Exchange of Securities. At the effective time of the merger,

   . each share of VidaMed common stock issued and outstanding (other than
     dissenting shares and shares held in VidaMed's treasury or by Medtronic,
     Medtronic's merger subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Medtronic),
     together with the associated preferred stock purchase rights issued under
     VidaMed's stockholder rights plan, will be cancelled and converted into
     the right to receive $7.91 in cash, without interest.

   . each share of VidaMed common stock held in VidaMed's treasury or owned by
     Medtronic, Medtronic's merger subsidiary or any other subsidiary of
     Medtronic will be cancelled and retired and no consideration will be
     exchanged for such shares.

   . each share of VidaMed common stock for which appraisal rights have been
     exercised and perfected will be treated as described under the heading
     "Appraisal Rights" in this proxy statement.

   . each share of common stock of Medtronic's merger subsidiary will remain
     outstanding as one share of common stock of the surviving corporation in
     the merger.

   At the effective time, holders of unexercised options and warrants to
purchase shares of VidaMed common stock will be entitled to receive with
respect to each option or warrant an amount in cash equal to: (1) the excess,
if any, of $7.91 over the per share exercise price of the option or warrant,
multiplied by (2) the number of shares of VidaMed common stock issuable upon
exercise of the option or warrant (regardless of whether such option or warrant
is vested or not) immediately prior to the completion of the merger.

   Effects on Nasdaq Listing and Exchange Act Registration. Upon completion of
the merger, VidaMed common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap
Market and price quotations will no longer be available. VidaMed common stock
is currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Following
the merger, registration of VidaMed common stock under the Exchange Act will be
terminated, and VidaMed will be relieved of its obligation to comply with the
public reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, VidaMed will no
longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC, for example, annual
reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form
8-K. In addition, VidaMed will no longer be subject to the proxy rules in
Regulation 14A, the short-swing trading profit provisions of Section 16 and,
with respect to future transactions, the going-private provisions of Rule 13e-3
of the Exchange Act.

   Benefits and Detriments of the Merger to VidaMed Stockholders. VidaMed
believes that the merger will result in the benefits to VidaMed stockholders
described under the heading "--Recommendation of the Board of Directors and
Reasons for the Merger," including the following:

   . it will allow them to immediately realize the value of their investment in
     VidaMed in cash at a price which represents a significant premium to the
     market price for VidaMed common stock before the public announcement of
     the merger agreement; and

   . it will eliminate the risk of a future decline in the value of their
     investment in VidaMed.

   VidaMed believes that the merger will result in the detriments to VidaMed
stockholders described under the heading "--Recommendation of the Board of
Directors and Reasons for the Merger," including the following:

   . they will no longer be stockholders of or have any ownership interests in
     VidaMed and will cease to participate in any future earnings and growth of
     VidaMed, and benefit from any future increases in VidaMed's value; and

   . they may recognize a taxable gain as a result of the merger (see
     "--Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations").

   Benefits and Detriments of the Merger to VidaMed. VidaMed believes that the
merger will result in the benefits to VidaMed described under the heading
"--Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger,"
including the following:

   . the increased scale, scope and financial strength of Medtronic and the
     increased access to capital, enhanced marketing capability and larger
     sales force of Medtronic may help grow VidaMed's business and permit
     VidaMed to leverage its technology by pursuing other opportunities;

   . by becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medtronic, which is a larger and
     more diversified public company, the operating flexibility of VidaMed will
     be increased by enabling VidaMed's management to react with greater speed
     and flexibility to changing conditions and to make decisions based on
     VidaMed's long-range business interests without having to consider the
     possible adverse short-term effect of such decisions upon the market price
     of VidaMed common stock and the interests of VidaMed's public
     shareholders; and

   . the opportunity of VidaMed to reduce costs through economies of scale that
     would not have been readily achievable by VidaMed independently, and the
     elimination of redundant operations and duplicate administrative functions.

   VidaMed believes that the merger will result in the detriments to VidaMed
described under the heading "--Recommendation of the Board of Directors and
Reasons for the Merger," including the following:

   . the announcement of the merger and the efforts necessary to complete the
     merger may result in a disruption in the business operations of VidaMed
     by, among other things, diverting management and other resources of
     VidaMed from its day to day business; and

   . key personnel may choose not to remain employed with VidaMed after the
     merger that could disrupt VidaMed's business.

   Benefits and Detriments of the Merger to Medtronic. As a result of the
merger, VidaMed will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medtronic; and therefore,
the entire interest in VidaMed's net book value and net earnings will be owned
by Medtronic. VidaMed believes that the merger will result in the following
benefits to Medtronic:

   . Medtronic will receive 100% of the benefit of any future earnings and
     growth of VidaMed and any future increases in the value of VidaMed; and

   . Medtronic will have complete control over the business of VidaMed.

   VidaMed believes the detriments to Medtronic of the completion of the merger
are:

   . Medtronic will bear 100% of the risk of any future losses of VidaMed and
     any future decreases in the value of VidaMed; and

   . the significant cash outlay by Medtronic to complete the merger (see "--
     Source of Funds").

Medtronic's Purpose, Reasons for and Structure of the Merger

   Medtronic's purpose for the transaction is to acquire all of VidaMed's
issued and outstanding stock. To allow such acquisition, the parties structured
the transaction as a merger of VidaMed Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Medtronic, with and into VidaMed. Upon consummation of the
merger, all shares of VidaMed common stock and all options and warrants to
purchase VidaMed common stock issued and outstanding (except any shares held by
Medtronic and its subsidiaries and any shares as to which dissenters' rights
have been exercised) will be converted into the right to receive a cash
payment, and the shares, options and warrants will automatically be cancelled
and retired, thus leaving Medtronic as sole shareholder of the company
surviving the merger. After the merger, Medtronic intends to make the necessary
filings with the SEC to

terminate the registration of VidaMed common stock and thus, VidaMed's
reporting obligations. As a result, VidaMed common stock will no longer be
quoted on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market. Medtronic proposes to acquire VidaMed
because it considers VidaMed's business to be a strategically valuable addition
to Medtronic's existing "Neurological, Spinal, Diabetes, and ENT" business unit.

Position of Medtronic as to Fairness of the Merger

   Medtronic believes that the merger and the cash consideration to be paid in
the merger to the holders of VidaMed's stock are fair to such holders.
Medtronic bases its belief on the following:

   . After a thorough review with independent financial and legal advisors and
     arms-length negotiations with Medtronic and another bidder, VidaMed's
     board concluded that the merger is advisable, and that the terms of the
     merger are fair to and in the best interests of the holders of VidaMed
     common stock (other than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The Medtronic
     Foundation) and recommended that VidaMed stockholders approve the merger
     agreement. VidaMed's director Michael D. Ellwein, who is also a
     vice-president and officer of Medtronic, did not participate in the
     deliberations or the vote of the board regarding the merger.

   . On December 5, 2001, VidaMed's board of directors received a fairness
     opinion from Banc of America Securities that subject to the various
     assumptions and limitations set forth in that opinion, as of the date
     thereof, the merger consideration of $7.91 per share to be received by the
     VidaMed stockholders was fair, from a financial point of view, to VidaMed
     stockholders (other than Medtronic and its affiliates ) as described under
     "Opinion of VidaMed's Financial Advisor."

   . While negotiating with Medtronic, VidaMed's board of directors was also
     negotiating with another bidder. The maximum merger consideration per
     share that the other bidder was willing to pay was $6.94, i.e. $0.97 less
     than the consideration to be paid to VidaMed stockholders under the merger
     agreement with Medtronic.

   . On December 5, 2001, before the public announcement of the merger
     agreement, the closing price for VidaMed stock was $5.67. The per share
     merger consideration of $7.91 exceeds such closing price by 39.5%.

   In connection with its determination of the fairness of the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, Medtronic adopted the conclusions as
to fairness set forth under "Recommendation of the Board of Directors and
Reasons for the Merger", and the analyses underlying such conclusions of
VidaMed's board, based on its views as to the reasonableness of such analyses.
Medtronic also reviewed the procedures followed by VidaMed's board in its
evaluations of the terms of the proposed merger, and determined them to be
reasonable grounds on which to decide that the merger was fair to VidaMed
stockholders. In view of the variety of factors considered in reaching its
decisions, Medtronic did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to
the various factors considered in reaching its belief as to fairness.

Interests of VidaMed's Directors and Officers in the Merger

   In considering the recommendation of the board of directors to approve and
adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of VidaMed's
directors and officers have interests in the merger or have relationships,
including those referred to below. These interests may present actual or
potential, or the appearance of actual or potential, conflicts of interest in
connection with the merger. The board of directors was aware of these actual or
potential conflicts of interest and considered them along with other matters
that have been described in this proxy statement under the heading "Special
Factors--Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger."

   Severance Agreements. All of our executive officers have entered into
severance agreements with VidaMed that entitle these officers to certain
payments if they voluntarily terminate their employment with

VidaMed or are otherwise terminated other than for cause in connection with, or
after completion of, the merger. The following is a summary of the material
benefits these executives would receive:

   . a lump sum payment of a pro rata bonus through the date of termination
     equal to the greatest of the amount of bonuses received by the executive
     over a certain measurement period, as described in the severance agreement;

   . severance pay in an amount equal to the greatest of the amount of the
     annual base salary plus bonus received by the executive over a certain
     measurement period, as described in the severance agreement (twice the
     amount in the case of Randy D. Lindholm);

   . continuation of coverage and benefits under VidaMed's life, disability,
     medical, dental and hospitalization insurance for 12 months (24 months in
     the case of Randy D. Lindholm) after the termination date for the
     executive and his or her other dependents and beneficiaries (subject to
     reduction if the executive obtains equivalent benefits under a subsequent
     employer's benefit plans); and

   . outplacement services in an amount not to exceed $15,000.

   These severance agreements were amended in November 2001 to clarify that the
executive would receive benefits if the executive is terminated by VidaMed
without cause after the merger and to revise the provision regarding "excess
parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code to state
that payments to the executive in connection with the merger would only be
reduced if such reduction, after taking into account the excise tax applicable
to such payments, would yield a greater net payment to such executive.

   As a condition to entering into the merger agreement, Medtronic required
each of these executives to enter into a side letter agreement with Medtronic
pursuant to which each of these executives agreed to use all reasonable efforts
to take certain actions so that none of the payments to the executive under the
severance agreement would be considered an "excess parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. These actions consist of exercising
VidaMed stock options during the calendar year 2001 and selling such number of
the underlying shares of VidaMed common stock as is necessary to pay the
exercise prices of such options and U.S. federal and state taxes incurred in
connection with such stock option exercises.

   Employment Agreements  Several of our executive officers will enter into
employment agreements with VidaMed that will become effective upon completion
of the merger. The terms of these agreements have not yet been negotiated.

   Ownership of VidaMed Stock. Most of our directors and executive officers own
VidaMed common stock and, like our stockholders, will be entitled to receive
merger consideration for their shares. We refer you to the information included
elsewhere in this proxy statement under the heading "Security Ownership of
Management and Principal Stockholders" for information regarding our current
directors and executive officers and their stock ownership in VidaMed.

   Ownership of VidaMed Stock Options. Several of our directors and executive
officers hold options to purchase shares of VidaMed common stock. All of the
options held by our directors and our executive officers will, like other
VidaMed stock options, be automatically accelerated and cashed out in the
merger pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. The following table shows
the number of stock options held by each of our directors and executive
officers and the amounts each of these directors and officers will receive with
respect to their VidaMed stock options upon completion of the merger:

                                      Number of  Amount to Be Paid Upon
Name of Director or Executive Officer  Options  Completion of the Merger
- ------------------------------------- --------- ------------------------

         Randy D. Lindholm........... 1,885,167       $10,468,047
         John F. Howe................   459,000       $ 2,540,213
         Stephen J. Williams.........   438,336       $ 2,055,109
         Lewis P. Chapman............   300,000       $ 1,229,100
         Elizabeth H. Davila.........    30,000       $   167,925
         Michael D. Ellwein..........    25,000       $    95,875
         Robert J. Erra..............    21,668       $    87,847
         Paulita M. LaPlante.........    30,000       $   179,805
         Kurt C. Wheeler.............    30,000       $   179,805

   Any amounts actually paid to these directors and executive officers for the
cancellation of their stock options will be reduced by any applicable federal
and state income and payroll tax withholdings.

   Indemnification. The merger agreement provides that for six years after the
date the merger is completed VidaMed, as the surviving corporation, will
indemnify our current directors and executive officers against matters
occurring before the merger became effective to the extent provided under our
restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws in effect on the date
of the merger agreement. Medtronic has also agreed under the merger agreement
that for six years following the completion of the merger, it or VidaMed will
provide directors' and officers' liability insurance for each person currently
covered by VidaMed's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy so
long as the premiums for such policy do not exceed 100% of the amount VidaMed
currently pays for its insurance.

Relationship Between VidaMed and Medtronic

   In considering the recommendation of the board of directors with respect to
the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that a subsidiary of
Medtronic owns approximately 6,100,000 shares, or 17%, of VidaMed's outstanding
common stock and that The Medtronic Foundation, a charitable private foundation
of which Medtronic is the sole member, owns warrants to purchase an additional
1,590,000 shares, or approximately 4% of VidaMed's outstanding common stock
(assuming the exercise of this warrant). In addition, Michael D. Ellwein, who
is a director of VidaMed, is Vice President and Chief Development Officer of
Medtronic.

   In January 2000, VidaMed sold 5,300,000 shares of VidaMed common stock and
warrants to purchase 1,590,000 shares to Medtronic Asset Management for a
purchase price of $9,169,000. Several other accredited investors also
participated in this private placement. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase
agreement, VidaMed agreed to give Medtronic Asset Management the right to
designate one person for election to VidaMed's board of directors so long as
Medtronic continued to own at least 3,789,500 shares of VidaMed common stock.
In March 2000, Michael D. Ellwein was elected to the board of directors as
Medtronic's designee. The exercise price of the warrants issued in the January
2000 financing has been reduced to zero as a result of the anti-dilution
provisions in the warrants and the grant by VidaMed of zero-priced options to
employees after the issuance of these warrants.

   In November 2000, VidaMed sold 800,000 shares of VidaMed common stock for
$2.00 per share, for an aggregate of $1,600,000, to Medtronic Asset Management.
As with the January 2000 financing, several other accredited investors also
participated in this private placement.

   In connection with Medtronic's initial investment in January 2000, VidaMed
and Medtronic entered into a confidentiality agreement to exchange confidential
information. A new confidentiality agreement was entered into by the parties in
June 2001.

   Effective December 31, 2001, Medtronic Asset Management, Inc. was merged
with and into Medtronic International, Ltd., a Delaware corporation which is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Medtronic. As a consequence of such merger, the
shares of VidaMed common stock purchased by Medtronic Asset Management are now
held by Medtronic International.

Plans for VidaMed After the Merger

   Medtronic expects to integrate VidaMed in its "Neurological, Spinal,
Diabetes and ENT" business unit and to consolidate the day-to-day business and
operations of VidaMed with those of Medtronic and its subsidiaries belonging to
such unit. Medtronic expects to retain VidaMed's sales and marketing employees
and certain other employees of VidaMed. A review of the entire business and
operations of VidaMed and the preparation of a complete integration plan by
Medtronic is ongoing.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

   The following discussion is a summary of material United States federal
income tax consequences of the merger to VidaMed, Medtronic and its
subsidiaries and VidaMed stockholders whose shares of VidaMed common stock are
held as capital assets and converted into the right to receive $7.91 cash in
the merger. Because it is a summary, it does not include an analysis of all
potential tax effects of the merger.

   For example, this summary:

   . does not consider the effect of any applicable state, local or foreign tax
     laws;

   . does not address all aspects of federal income taxation that may affect
     particular stockholders in light of their particular circumstances;

   . is not intended for stockholders that may be subject to special federal
     income tax rules, such as:

     . insurance companies;

     . tax-exempt organizations;

     . financial institutions or broker-dealers;

     . stockholders who hold their VidaMed common stock as part of a hedge,
       straddle or conversion transaction;

     . stockholders who acquired their VidaMed common stock pursuant to the
       exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation; and

     . stockholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States or
       that are foreign corporations, foreign partnerships or foreign estates
       or trusts as to the United States;
   . does not address tax consequences to holders of VidaMed stock options; and

   . does not address, except as expressly provided below, the tax consequences
     to Medtronic, any of its subsidiaries or any person who would be treated
     as constructively owning VidaMed common stock immediately after the merger
     by reason of the attribution rules of Section 318 of the Internal Revenue
     Code.

   This summary assumes that stockholders have held their VidaMed common stock
as a "capital asset" under the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, a "capital
asset" is property held for investment.

   This summary is based on the current provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code, applicable Treasury Regulations, judicial authorities and administrative
rulings and practice. It is possible that the Internal Revenue Service will
take a contrary view. Neither VidaMed nor Medtronic nor any of their affiliates
or subsidiaries, respectively, has sought or intends to seek a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service with respect to any aspect of the merger. Future
legislative, judicial or administrative changes or interpretations could alter
or modify the statements and conclusions set forth in this section. Any of
these changes or interpretations could be retroactive and could affect the tax
consequences of the merger to you.

   You should consult your own tax advisor with respect to the particular tax
consequences of the merger, including the applicability and effect of any
state, local or foreign tax laws, and of changes in applicable tax laws.

   Treatment of VidaMed and Medtronic. For federal income tax purposes, the
merger will be treated as a purchase by Medtronic of all of the common stock of
VidaMed that it did not previously own. Accordingly, neither VidaMed nor
Medtronic or its subsidiaries are expected to incur any material U.S. federal
income tax consequences as a result of the merger.

   Treatment of Holders of VidaMed Common Stock. The conversion of your shares
of VidaMed common stock into the right to receive $7.91 cash in the merger, or
pursuant to the exercise of your appraisal rights, will be fully taxable to
you. Subject to the assumptions and limitations described above, you will
recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the difference between:

   . the amount of cash you receive in the merger; and

   . your tax basis in your shares of VidaMed common stock.

   Generally, your tax basis in your shares of VidaMed common stock will be
equal to what you paid for your shares.

   If you are an individual,

   . long-term capital gain will be taxable at a maximum capital gains rate of
     20% if you held your shares for more than one year at the time of the
     merger, gain on shares held for one year or less will be subject to
     ordinary income tax rates; and

   . capital loss may only be offset against capital gains or up to $3,000 per
     year of ordinary income, with a carryover of capital loss to subsequent
     years to the extent unused.

   Backup Withholding. You may be subject to backup withholding up to the rate
of 31% with respect to the gross proceeds you receive from the conversion of
your VidaMed common stock unless you:

   . are a corporation or other exempt recipient and, when required, establish
     this exemption; or

   . provide your correct taxpayer identification number, certify that you are
     not currently subject to backup withholding and otherwise comply with
     applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

   If after the merger you do not provide the paying agent with your correct
taxpayer identification number or any other documents or certifications
required by the Internal Revenue Service, including among others, a Form W-9 or
a substitute for this Form, you may be subject to penalties imposed by the
Internal Revenue Service. Any amount withheld under these backup withholding
rules will be creditable against your federal income tax liability. The paying
agent will report to you and to the Internal Revenue Service the amount of any
reportable payment made to you (including payments made to you pursuant to the
merger) and any amount withheld pursuant to the merger.

Accounting Treatment

   The merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, whereby the value of
the consideration paid in the merger will be allocated based upon the estimated
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the effective
date of the merger.

Source of Funds

   The aggregate cash consideration payable in the merger to all VidaMed
stockholders (except to Medtronic and its subsidiaries and VidaMed stockholders
who have exercised their dissenters' rights) is approximately $326 million. The
funds will be provided from Medtronic's existing capital resources.

Fees and Expenses

   VidaMed estimates that merger-related fees and expenses, consisting
primarily of financial advisory fees, fees and expenses of attorneys and
accountants, HSR Act filing fees, SEC filing fees and other related charges,
will total approximately $3.2 million, assuming the merger is completed. This
amount consists of the following estimated fees:

Description                                Amount
- -----------                              ----------

Advisory fees and expenses.............. $2,585,000
Legal fees and expenses.................    350,000
Accounting fees and expenses............     12,000
HSR Act filing fee......................    125,000
SEC filing fee..........................     65,392
Printing, solicitation and mailing costs     60,000
Miscellaneous expenses..................     10,000
                                         ----------
   Total................................ $3,207,392
                                         ==========

Regulatory Requirements

   In connection with the merger, VidaMed will be required to make a number of
filings with and obtain a number of approvals from various federal and state
governmental agencies, including:

   . filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State
     of Delaware in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law after
     the approval and adoption of the merger agreement by VidaMed stockholders;

   . complying with federal and state securities laws; and

   . notifying and furnishing certain information to the Federal Trade
     Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
     pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
     amended, or HSR Act.

   Under the HSR Act, the merger may not be completed until the expiration of a
waiting period of 30 calendar days following the receipt of all required
filings, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC or the
Antitrust Division, or unless the waiting period is extended by a request for
additional information or documentary material. VidaMed and Medtronic made the
requisite filings under the HSR Act on January 4, 2002. Both VidaMed and
Medtronic believe that the completion of the merger will not violate any
antitrust laws. The FTC and the Antitrust Division have the authority to
challenge the merger on antitrust grounds before or after the merger is
completed. Each state in which VidaMed or Medtronic has operations may also
review the merger under state antitrust laws.

Stockholder Lawsuits Challenging the Merger

   Four complaints have been filed in the Delaware Chancery Court against
VidaMed, members of VidaMed's board of directors and Medtronic. These
complaints purport to be filed by stockholders of VidaMed and include requests
for declarations that the actions be maintained as class actions. These
complaints allege, among other things, that:

   . Medtronic and the directors and officers of VidaMed possessed non-public
     information about VidaMed and its future anticipated growth;

   . no truly independent body has operated to protect the interests of VidaMed
     stockholders (other than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The Medtronic
     Foundation);

   . VidaMed's board of directors breached its fiduciary duties owed to VidaMed
     stockholders (other than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The Medtronic
     Foundation) by, among other things, facilitating, through unfair
     procedures and without implementing an adequate sales process designed to
     maximize stockholder value, Medtronic's proposal to acquire VidaMed to the
     exclusion of others, for unfair and inadequate consideration; and

   . the proposed transaction is not entirely fair to VidaMed stockholders
     (other than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The Medtronic Foundation)
     because the merger consideration is unfair and inadequate.

   The plaintiffs seek, among other things,

   . a declaration that the lawsuit be a class action and certification of the
     plaintiff as the class representatives;

   . an injunction enjoining the merger transaction under the terms presently
     proposed;

   . if the transaction takes places, rescission or, in the alternative,
     unspecified rescissory damages;

   . payment to the plaintiff and other members of the class of unspecified
     damages;

   . payment of fees of attorneys and experts; and

   . such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.

   VidaMed believes that the complaints are without merit and intends to
vigorously contest the lawsuits.

                             THE MERGER AGREEMENT

   On December 5, 2001, VidaMed entered into the merger agreement with
Medtronic and VidaMed Acquisition Corp. The following is a summary of the
material provisions of the merger agreement. Because it is a summary, it does
not include all of the information that is included in the merger agreement.
The text of the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy
statement, is incorporated into this section by reference. VidaMed encourages
you to read the merger agreement carefully in its entirety.

The Merger

   At the effective time of the merger, Medtronic's merger subsidiary will
merge with and into VidaMed and VidaMed will continue as the surviving
corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medtronic under a new name,
Medtronic VidaMed, Inc.

   As the surviving corporation after the merger, VidaMed will have all the
property, rights and powers of VidaMed and Medtronic's merger subsidiary before
the merger, and it will be liable for all of the debts, liabilities and
obligations of VidaMed and Medtronic's merger subsidiary before the merger.
After the merger, the separate corporate existence of Medtronic's merger
subsidiary will cease.

   The certificate of incorporation of VidaMed immediately before the merger
will be amended at the effective time of the merger to read as set forth in
Exhibit A to the merger agreement. The bylaws of Medtronic's merger subsidiary
in effect immediately before the merger will become the surviving corporation's
bylaws immediately after the merger.

   The directors of Medtronic's merger subsidiary immediately before the merger
will become the directors of the surviving corporation and the executive
officers of VidaMed immediately before the merger will become the executive
officers of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger.

Exchange of Securities; Merger Consideration

   At the effective time of the merger:

   . each share of VidaMed common stock issued and outstanding (other than
     dissenting shares and shares held in VidaMed's treasury or by Medtronic,
     Medtronic's merger subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Medtronic),
     together with the associated preferred stock purchase rights issued under
     VidaMed's stockholder rights plan, will be cancelled and converted into
     the right to receive $7.91 in cash, without interest;

   . each share of VidaMed common stock held in VidaMed's treasury or owned by
     Medtronic, Medtronic's merger subsidiary or any other subsidiary of
     Medtronic will be cancelled and retired and no consideration will be
     exchanged for such shares;

   . each share of VidaMed common stock for which appraisal rights have been
     exercised and perfected will be treated as described under the heading
     "Appraisal Rights" in this proxy statement; and

   . each share of common stock of Medtronic's merger subsidiary will remain
     outstanding as one share of common stock of the surviving corporation in
     the merger.

Time of Closing

   The merger will close at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, on a date to be
specified by VidaMed and Medtronic which will be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the merger. To
complete the merger, Medtronic and VidaMed will file a certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Exchange and Payment Procedures

   Medtronic and VidaMed have appointed Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as paying agent
to handle the exchange of VidaMed's stock certificates in the merger for cash.
Soon after the merger becomes effective, the paying agent will mail to you a
letter of transmittal and instructions explaining how to exchange your stock
certificates for cash. Upon surrender to the paying agent of a valid stock
certificate and a properly completed letter of transmittal, along with such
other documents as the paying agent may reasonably require, you will be
entitled to receive $7.91 in cash per share. Until surrendered in this manner,
each VidaMed stock certificate will represent only the right to receive the
merger consideration.

   You should not send your VidaMed stock certificates now. You should send
them only after you receive a letter of transmittal from the paying agent. A
letter of transmittal will be mailed to you soon after the merger becomes
effective.

   Any merger consideration made available to the paying agent that remains
unclaimed by VidaMed stockholders for six months after the time the merger
becomes effective will be returned to Medtronic, and any of VidaMed
stockholders who has not by that time made an exchange of his, her or its
VidaMed stock certificates for the merger consideration must then look to
Medtronic for payment of the merger consideration. Amounts unclaimed after
three years will be kept by Medtronic, subject to state unclaimed property laws.

Transfers of Shares

   No transfers of shares of VidaMed common stock will be made on VidaMed's
stock transfer books after the merger becomes effective.

Treatment of Stock Options

   At the time the merger becomes effective, all outstanding vested and
unvested options to purchase shares of VidaMed common stock that were granted
under the VidaMed, Inc. Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Plan, VidaMed, Inc.
Amended and Restated 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan or VidaMed,
Inc. Amended and Restated 1999 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan will be
canceled. In exchange, these holders of options will receive upon completion of
the merger, with respect to each option, an amount in cash equal to (1) the
excess, if any, of $7.91 over the per share exercise price of the option,
multiplied by (2) the number of shares of VidaMed common stock issuable upon
exercise of the option (regardless of whether such option is vested or not)
immediately prior to the completion of the merger. For example, if an option
holder holds options to purchase 5,000 shares of VidaMed common stock at an
exercise price of $2.00, 1,500 shares of which were vested as of the effective
time and 3,500 shares of which were unvested as of the effective time, the
option holder will receive in exchange for this option, a cash payment of
$29,550 ($7.91 (merger consideration) minus $2.00 (exercise price), multiplied
by 5,000 (number of vested and unvested shares subject to the option)), less
any amounts required to be withheld. Not later than 30 days prior to the
effective time of the merger, VidaMed will send a notice to all holders of
outstanding options to purchase shares of VidaMed common stock specifying that
such options will not be assumed in connection with the merger and will instead
terminate and be cancelled at such time and represent only the right to receive
the consideration, if any, specified above.

Treatment of Warrants

   At the time the merger becomes effective, all outstanding warrants to
purchase shares of VidaMed common stock will be canceled. In exchange, these
holders of warrants will receive upon completion of the merger, with respect to
each warrant, an amount in cash equal to (1) the excess of $7.91 over the per
share exercise price of the warrant, multiplied by (2) the number of shares of
VidaMed common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant. Not later than 30
days prior to the effective time of the merger, VidaMed will send a notice to
all holders of outstanding warrants to purchase shares of VidaMed common stock
specifying that such warrants will

not be assumed in connection with the merger and will instead terminate and be
cancelled at such time and represent only the right to receive the
consideration specified above.

Dissenting Shares

   Shares of VidaMed common stock held by VidaMed stockholders that have
properly exercised and perfected their demand for appraisal rights, will not be
converted into the right to receive the $7.91 per share merger consideration.
These stockholders will instead be entitled to receive the "fair value" of
their shares as determined under Delaware law.

Representations and Warranties

   In the merger agreement, VidaMed has made several representations and
warranties to each of Medtronic and Medtronic's merger subsidiary. These
representations and warranties relate to, among other things:

     agreement;

     laws;

   The merger agreement also contains representations and warranties of
Medtronic and Medtronic's merger subsidiary relating to, among other things:

   . organization, standing, foreign qualifications, and similar corporate
     matters;

   . authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to enter into the merger
     agreement;

   . the information supplied by Medtronic and Medtronic's merger subsidiary in
     connection with this proxy statement;

   . the absence of pending or threatened litigation;

   . finders' fees and expenses; and

   . funds required to complete the merger.

   The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive
the closing of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.

     before any governmental entity (including, but not limited to, the United
     States Federal Drug Administration) or any nongovernmental self-regulatory
     agency; or

   . taking, or agreeing to commit to take, or failing to take any action that
     would make any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of VidaMed
     contained in the merger agreement inaccurate or breached such that the
     conditions as described under the heading "--Conditions to the Merger"
     will not be satisfied at, or as of any time prior to, the consummation of
     the merger.

   VidaMed has also agreed not to commit or publicly announce an intention to
do any of these things.

   No Solicitation. VidaMed has agreed that it and its subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, counsel,
representatives and agents will not, directly or indirectly, except to the
extent provided below:

   . solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate the making
     of an acquisition proposal, or offer or proposal by a third party other
     than Medtronic to acquire VidaMed;

   . engage in or knowingly encourage in any way negotiations or discussions
     concerning, or provide any confidential information regarding VidaMed to,
     any third party relating to an acquisition proposal or which it may
     reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; or

   . agree to or endorse any acquisition proposal.

   Despite this restriction, neither VidaMed nor its board of directors is
prohibited from:

   . taking and disclosing to VidaMed stockholders a position contemplated by
     Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act; or

   . making any legally required disclosure to VidaMed stockholders.

   In addition, this restriction does not prohibit VidaMed or its board of
directors from, prior to the date on which VidaMed stockholders adopt the
merger agreement, furnishing confidential information regarding VidaMed to or
entering into discussions or negotiations with any third party that makes a
superior offer, or a bona fide acquisition proposal that VidaMed's board of
directors has reasonably and in good faith determined after consultation with,
among other persons, its financial advisors and outside counsel, to be more
favorable to the stockholders of VidaMed than the merger, taking into account
all relevant factors if and only if:

   . the failure of VidaMed's board of directors to take such action would be a
     breach of the board of directors' fiduciary duties to VidaMed stockholders;

   . prior to furnishing any confidential information to, or first entering
     into substantive discussions and negotiations with, any third party,

     . VidaMed provides written notice of at least five business days to
       Medtronic to the effect that it intends to furnish information to, or
       enter into discussions or negotiations, with a third party, and naming
       and identifying the third party making the acquisition proposal;

     . VidaMed enters into a confidentiality agreement with the third party
       with terms no less favorable to VidaMed than the confidentiality
       agreement between VidaMed and Medtronic; and

     . VidaMed concurrently provides to Medtronic all confidential information
       that is to be provided to the third party that Medtronic has not
       previously received from VidaMed, and VidaMed keeps Medtronic reasonably
       informed of the status and material terms and conditions and all other
       material information with respect to any discussions and negotiations
       with the third party.

   VidaMed has agreed to notify Medtronic within two business days of the
receipt of any acquisition proposal that it may receive, or any inquiry
reasonably likely to lead to an acquisition proposal or if any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with VidaMed concerning an
acquisition proposal. This notification must contain the name of the third
party involved and the material terms and conditions of the acquisition
proposal.

   Covenants Relating to the Stockholders Meeting and Proxy Materials. VidaMed
has agreed to call a meeting of its stockholders to vote on the merger
agreement and the merger. VidaMed has also agreed that its board of directors
will recommend approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger by
VidaMed stockholders and that it will not withdraw its recommendation. This
obligation to recommend is subject, however, to the fiduciary duties of
VidaMed's directors. VidaMed has also agreed to prepare and mail this proxy
statement.

   VidaMed, Inc. Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
VidaMed has agreed to take all actions necessary to insure that no new offering
periods under the VidaMed, Inc. Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan will commence following the current offering period which ends on
December 31, 2001 and to terminate the plan immediately prior to the time the
merger takes effect.

   SEC Filings. VidaMed, jointly with Medtronic, has agreed to file a
transaction statement with the SEC relating to the merger as required by the
SEC's Rule 13e-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The information
included in this proxy statement is intended to comply with Rule 13e-3.

Medtronic's Covenants

   Medtronic has also undertaken several covenants in the merger agreement. The
following summarizes the more significant of these covenants.

   SEC Filings. Medtronic, jointly with VidaMed, has agreed to file a
transaction statement with the SEC relating to the merger as required by the
SEC's Rule 13e-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The information
included in this proxy statement is intended to comply with Rule 13e-3.

   Employee Benefits and Employee Matters. Medtronic has agreed to provide, or
will cause the surviving corporation to provide, employee benefits and programs
to VidaMed's employees that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable or
more favorable, as a whole, than those in effect on December 5, 2001, except
that stock-based compensation will be comparable to that offered by Medtronic
and its subsidiaries to their employees. In addition, Medtronic will, or cause
the surviving corporation to, give employees of VidaMed, and any subsidiary of
VidaMed, full credit for service accrued under employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by VidaMed, and any subsidiary of VidaMed, for purposes
of eligibility, level of participation and vesting, except that no credit will
be granted to the extent that such credit will result in duplicative accrual of
benefits for the same period of service.

   Indemnification and Insurance of VidaMed's Directors and Officers. Medtronic
has agreed to cause VidaMed, as the surviving company after the merger, to
indemnify VidaMed's present and former officers and directors against matters
occurring before the merger became effective. This obligation will last for a
period of six years. Medtronic has also agreed that for six years after the
closing date of the merger, it will cause VidaMed, as the surviving company, to
provide officers' and directors' liability insurance for each person currently
covered by VidaMed's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on
terms no less favorable than VidaMed's

current policy. However, VidaMed will not be obligated to pay premiums in
excess of the amount VidaMed currently pays for its insurance.

Additional Agreements

   Both parties to the merger agreement have agreed to use commercially
reasonable best efforts to do or cause to be done anything necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the merger. The parties have also agreed to cooperate
with each other in relation to certain matters, including making the necessary
SEC filings, obtaining regulatory and other consents and making public
announcements.

merger are subject to the satisfaction or, if legally permissible, waiver at or

   . the absence of any legal prohibition that has the effect of making the
     merger illegal or otherwise prohibits consummation of the merger;

   . the expiration or early termination of the HSR Act waiting period; and

   . all consents, approvals, authorizations legally required to be obtained to
     complete the merger will be obtained and will be final and in full force

     state of facts that has had a material adverse effect on Medtronic.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

   The merger agreement may be terminated at any time before the closing in any
of the following ways:

   (1) by mutual written consent of the board of directors of each of VidaMed,
       Medtronic and Medtronic's merger subsidiary;

   (2) by either VidaMed or Medtronic if the merger is not completed by May 31,
       2002 and the party seeking to terminate is not in breach of its
       obligations under the merger agreement in any material respect (if a
       request for additional information is received by VidaMed from the U.S.
       Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice pursuant to the
       Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, this date will be extended to the 90/th/ day
       following acknowledgment by the FTC or the DOJ that VidaMed and
       Medtronic have complied with such request, but in any event, not later
       than July 31, 2002);

   (3) by either VidaMed or Medtronic if completion of the merger is illegal or
       prohibited;

   (4) by either VidaMed or Medtronic if VidaMed stockholders do not approve
       the merger agreement and the merger, except that the right to terminate
       the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to
       perform any material obligation under the merger agreement has been the
       proximate cause of, or resulted in, the failure of VidaMed stockholders
       to approve the merger agreement;

   (5) by Medtronic if:

       . VidaMed has materially breached the non-solicitation covenant
         described above under the heading "--VidaMed's Covenants";

       . VidaMed's board of directors has recommended to VidaMed stockholders
         an acquisition proposal or resolved or announced an intention to do so;

       . VidaMed's board of directors has withdrawn or modified in a manner
         adverse to Medtronic the recommendation of VidaMed's board of
         directors of the merger; or

       . a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding
         shares of VidaMed common stock is commenced, and either, VidaMed's
         board of directors recommends acceptance of such tender offer or
         exchange offer by its stockholders, or, within 10 business days after
         such tender offer or exchange offer is so commenced, VidaMed's board
         of directors either fails to recommend against acceptance of such
         tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders;

   (6) by VidaMed prior to the special meeting (or any postponement or
       adjournment of the meeting) if:

       . VidaMed is not in material breach of its obligations under the merger
         agreement;

       . its board of directors has not materially breached any of its
         requirements, conditions and procedures in the non-solicitation
         covenant described above under the heading "--VidaMed's Covenants";

       . its board of directors has authorized VidaMed to enter into a binding
         written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a superior
         proposal and VidaMed notifies Medtronic in writing that it intends to
         enter into such binding agreement, which notice must have attached to
         it the most current version of such agreement ready for execution; and

       . Medtronic does not make within five business days after receipt of the
         notice, any offer that VidaMed's board of directors reasonably and in
         good faith determines, after consultation with its financial and legal
         advisors, is at least as favorable to VidaMed stockholders as the
         superior proposal and during such five business day period VidaMed
         reasonably considers and discusses in good faith all proposals
         submitted by Medtronic;

   (7) by Medtronic if:

       . Medtronic is not in material breach of its obligations under the
         merger agreement; and

       . there has been a material breach by VidaMed of any of its
         representations, warranties or obligations under the merger agreement
         such that the conditions to the merger described above under the
         heading "--Conditions to the Merger" will not be satisfied, but, if
         such material breach is curable, Medtronic may not terminate the
         merger agreement so long as VidaMed continues to exercise its
         reasonable best efforts to cure such a breach; or

   (8) by VidaMed if:

       . VidaMed is not in material breach of its obligations under the merger
         agreement; and

       . there has been a material breach by Medtronic or VidaMed Acquisition
         Corp. of any of its representations, warranties or obligations under
         the merger agreement such that the conditions to the merger described
         above under the heading "--Conditions to the Merger" will not be
         satisfied, but, if such material breach is curable, VidaMed may not
         terminate the merger agreement so long as Medtronic or VidaMed
         Acquisition Corp. continues to exercise its reasonable best efforts to
         cure such a breach.

   If the merger agreement terminates, it will become void. However,
termination will not affect the rights of either party against the other for
any willful breach of the merger agreement. Also, certain obligations survive
termination of the agreement, including the obligation to pay the fees
described under "Termination Fees" below and the confidentiality obligations.

Termination Fees

   VidaMed has agreed to pay Medtronic $13,040,000 in cash not later than five
business days after termination if the merger agreement is terminated by
Medtronic as described under clause (5) above under the heading "Termination of
the Merger Agreement." VidaMed has agreed to pay Medtronic $13,040,000 in cash
on the date of termination if the merger agreement is terminated by VidaMed as
described under clause (6) above under the heading "Termination of the Merger
Agreement."

   In addition, VidaMed has agreed to pay Medtronic $13,040,000 in cash, prior
to the earlier of the execution of the definitive agreement with respect to,
and the completion of the transaction contemplated by the acquisition proposal,
if:

   . the merger agreement is terminated by Medtronic or VidaMed as described
     under clause (2) or clause (4) above under the heading "Termination of the
     Merger Agreement";

   . at or prior to the time of termination an acquisition proposal with
     respect to VidaMed will have been made public; and

   . within 12 months of the termination of the merger agreement, VidaMed
     enters into an agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal or the
     transaction contemplated by the acquisition proposal shall have been
     consummated.

Expenses

   Except as described above, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring those costs or
expenses, except that Medtronic and VidaMed will share equally the filing fees
required under the HSR Act and the SEC filing fees required in connection with
this proxy statement and the Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement.

Amendments; Waivers

   Any provision of the merger agreement may be amended or waived before the
merger becomes effective. After approval of the merger agreement by VidaMed
stockholders, no amendment or waiver can be made that alters the consideration
to be received for VidaMed common stock or that would adversely affect the
rights of VidaMed stockholders, without their further approval.

Promissory Note and Security Agreement

   Simultaneously upon entering into the merger agreement with Medtronic and
Medtronic's merger subsidiary, Medtronic loaned VidaMed $5 million pursuant to
a promissory note and security agreement. The entire unpaid principal amount of
the note together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon will become due and
payable on the earlier of: (a) December 5, 2003; (b) 10 calendar days after
VidaMed is required to pay a termination fee under the merger agreement; or (c)
six months after termination of the merger agreement if VidaMed is not required
to pay a termination fee. The note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any
time and from time to time without penalty or premium. The note bears interest
at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal plus
one percent, calculated on a simple interest basis.

   The note is secured by a security interest in all of VidaMed's assets
pursuant to the security agreement. Medtronic's security interest in all of
VidaMed's assets is subordinate to any line of credit up to $3,000,000 VidaMed
obtains to replace its previous Transamerica Business Credit Corporation line
of credit.

                               APPRAISAL RIGHTS

You Have a Right to Dissent

   Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, if you do not wish to accept the
merger consideration of $7.91 per share for your shares of VidaMed common stock
as provided in the merger agreement, you have the right to dissent from the
merger and to seek an appraisal of, and to be paid the fair value (exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger) for, the shares of VidaMed common stock held by you, provided that you
comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

   Holders of record of VidaMed common stock who do not vote in favor of the
merger agreement and who otherwise comply with the applicable statutory
procedures will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
A person having a beneficial interest in shares of VidaMed common stock held of
record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act
promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below
properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights.

   The following discussion is a summary of the material provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is reprinted in its entirety in Appendix
C. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a
"stockholder" or "holder" are to the record holder of the shares of VidaMed
common stock as to which appraisal rights are asserted.

   Under Section 262 of the DGCL, holders of shares of VidaMed common stock who
follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to
have their shares appraised by the Delaware Chancery Court and to receive
payment in cash of the "fair value" of these shares, exclusive of any element
of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together
with a fair rate of interest, if any, as determined by such court.

We Must Provide You Notice of Your Appraisal Rights

   Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a proposed merger is to be submitted
for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20
days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders who was a
stockholder on the record date for such meeting with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available, that appraisal rights are so available,
and must include in such notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL.

   This proxy statement constitutes such notice to the holders of shares for
which appraisal rights are available and the applicable statutory provisions of
the DGCL are attached to this proxy statement as Appendix C. If you wish to
exercise your appraisal rights or you wish to preserve your right to do so, you
should review the following discussion and Appendix C carefully, because
failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures therein specified
will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.

A Dissenting Stockholder Must Perfect Appraisal Rights

   A holder of shares for which appraisal rights are available that wishes to
exercise such holder's appraisal rights

   . must not vote in favor of the merger agreement or consent thereto in
     writing (including by returning a signed proxy without indicating any
     voting instructions as to the proposal) and

   . must deliver to VidaMed prior to the vote on the merger agreement at the
     special meeting, a written demand for appraisal of the holder's shares.

   This written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from
any proxy or vote abstaining from or against the merger. This demand must
reasonably inform VidaMed of the identity of the stockholder and of the
stockholder's intent thereby to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A
holder of shares for which appraisal rights are available wishing to exercise
such holder's appraisal rights must be the record holder of such shares on the
date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold such
shares until the consummation of the merger. Accordingly, a holder of shares
for which appraisal rights are available who is the record holder of shares on
the date the written demand for appraisal is made, but who thereafter transfers
such shares prior to consummation of the merger, will lose any right to
appraisal in respect of such shares.

   Only a holder of record of shares for which appraisal rights are available
is entitled to assert appraisal rights for the shares registered in that
holder's name. A demand for appraisal should be executed by or on behalf of the
holder of record, fully and correctly, as this holder's name appears on this
holder's stock certificates. If the shares for which appraisal rights are
available are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, for example, by a
trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand should be made in that
capacity, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one owner as in a
joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including one or more joint
owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record. The
agent, however, must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose
the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is agent for such owner or
officers. A record holder such as a broker who holds shares for which appraisal
rights are available as nominee for several beneficial owners may exercise
appraisal rights with respect to the these shares held for one or more
beneficial owners while not exercising such rights with respect to the shares
held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand should set
forth the number of shares for which appraisal rights are available and is
sought. When no number of shares is expressly mentioned, the demand will be
presumed to cover all shares in brokerage accounts or other nominee forms.
Those beneficial owners who wish to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL are urged to consult with their brokers to determine the
appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such a
nominee.

   All written demands for appraisal should be sent or delivered to:

                                 VidaMed, Inc.
                             46107 Landing Parkway
                           Fremont, California 94538
                             Attention: Secretary

VidaMed Must Provide Each Stockholder that has Properly Asserted Appraisal
Rights Notice

   Within 10 days after the consummation of the merger, VidaMed will notify
each stockholder that has properly asserted appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL and that has not voted in favor of the merger agreement of the date
the merger became effective.

A Petition Must be Filed in the Delaware Chancery Court

   Within 120 days after the consummation of the merger, but not later,
VidaMed, as the surviving corporation, or any stockholder who has complied with
the statutory requirements summarized above may file a petition in the Delaware
Chancery Court demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of
VidaMed common stock that are entitled to appraisal rights. VidaMed is under no
obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition with respect to
the appraisal of the fair value of these shares that are entitled to appraisal
rights. Accordingly, it will be the obligation of stockholders wishing to
assert appraisal rights to initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Stockholders May Request Information

   Within 120 days after the consummation of the merger, any stockholder that
has complied with the requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be
entitled, upon written request, to receive from VidaMed a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares for which appraisal rights are available
not voted in favor of adoption of the merger agreement for which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of these
shares. These statements must be mailed within 10 days after a written request
therefor has been received by VidaMed, or within 10 days after expiration of
the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL,
whichever is later.

A Court Will Determine Stockholders Entitled to Appraisal Rights, Fair Value
and Allocation of Expenses

   If a petition for an appraisal is filed on a timely basis, after a hearing
on such petition, of which the Register in Chancery (if so ordered by the
Delaware Chancery Court) will give notice to stockholders, the Delaware
Chancery Court will determine the stockholders entitled to appraisal rights and
will appraise the "fair value" of the shares for which appraisal rights are
available, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be
paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.

   Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair
value of their shares of VidaMed common stock as determined under Section 262
of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the
consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did
not seek appraisal of their shares and that investment banking opinions as to
fairness from a financial point of view are not necessarily opinions as to fair
value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Delaware Supreme Court has stated,
however, that "proof of value by any techniques or methods that are generally
considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in
court" should be considered in the appraisal proceedings.

   The Delaware Chancery Court will determine the amount of interest, if any,
to be paid upon the amounts to be received by stockholders whose shares have
been appraised. The costs of the action may be determined by the Delaware
Chancery Court and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Chancery Court deems
equitable. The Delaware Chancery Court may also order that all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with an appraisal,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and
expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, be charged pro rata
against the value of all of the shares entitled to appraisal.

No Right to Vote Appraisal Shares or Receive Dividends or Distribution on
Appraisal Shares

   Any holder of shares for which appraisal rights are available that has duly
demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not,
after the completion of the merger, be entitled to vote these shares subject to
such demand for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other
distributions on those shares (except dividends or other distributions payable
to holders of record of shares as of a record date prior to the completion of
the merger).

Failure to Perfect Appraisal Rights

   If any stockholder that properly demands appraisal of his, her or its shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or
loses, his, her or its right to appraisal, as provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL, the shares of this stockholder will be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration of $7.91 per share. A stockholder will fail to
perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, his, her or its right to appraisal
if, among other things, no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days
after the completion of the merger, or if this stockholder delivers to VidaMed
a written withdrawal of his, her or its demand for appraisal. Any attempt to

withdraw an appraisal demand more than 60 days after the completion of the
merger will require the written approval of VidaMed, as the surviving company.

   Cash received pursuant to the exercise of your appraisal rights will be
subject to income tax. We refer you to the information under the heading
"Special Factors--Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations."

   Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for
perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of your rights. Under these
circumstances, you will be entitled to receive the $7.91 merger consideration
receivable with respect to your shares of VidaMed common stock in accordance
with the merger agreement.

                        PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   We have not provided any pro forma financial information giving effect to
the proposed merger in this proxy statement. We do not believe that such
information is material to you in evaluating the proposed merger since:

   . the proposed merger consideration is all cash;

   . if the proposed merger is completed, VidaMed common stock will cease to be
     publicly traded; and

   . you will not retain or receive a continuing interest in VidaMed's business
     after the merger.

                             FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS

   VidaMed does not as a matter of course make public forecasts as to future
revenues, earnings or other financial information. VidaMed did, however,
prepare projections that it provided to its board of directors and VidaMed's
financial advisor in connection with their review of the fairness from a
financial point of view of the merger consideration to VidaMed stockholders
(other than Medtronic, its subsidiaries and The Medtronic Foundation). In
addition, VidaMed provided Medtronic and the other bidder with projections. The
projections set forth below are included in this proxy statement only because
this information was provided to VidaMed's board of directors, financial
advisor, Medtronic and the other bidder.

   The projections set forth below are based on estimates and assumptions that
are inherently subject to significant economic, industry and competitive
uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many
of which are beyond VidaMed's control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that the projected results would be realized or that actual results would not
be significantly higher or lower than those projected. In addition, the
projections were not prepared with a view for public disclosure or compliance
with the published guidelines of the SEC or the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants regarding projections and forecasts and are included in this
proxy statement only because such information was furnished to VidaMed's
financial advisor, Medtronic and the other bidder that submitted a proposal to
acquire VidaMed. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an
indication that anyone who received this information considered it a reliable
predictor of future operating results, and therefore, this information should
not be relied upon as such. The projections were based upon a variety of
assumptions relating to the businesses of VidaMed that, although considered
reasonable by VidaMed's management at the time the projections were prepared,
may not be realized, and are subject to significant uncertainties and
contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of management. We refer you
to the information under the heading "Cautionary Statement Concerning
Forward-Looking Statements" in this proxy statement. The projections have not
been examined, compiled or otherwise had agreed-upon procedures or any other
procedures applied to them by Ernst & Young LLP and, accordingly, Ernst & Young
LLP assumes no responsibility for them. VidaMed does not intend to update or
revise the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when
prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events, unless it is otherwise
required by law.

   VidaMed's management prepared two sets of projections or scenarios to show
the financial outlook of VidaMed. These two scenarios were labeled "base case
projections" and "accelerated case projections." The base case projections
reflected management's then current view of VidaMed's future prospects in light
of present and expected future business trends. The accelerated case
projections assumed more accelerated operating assumptions and were designed to
present the possibility for additional growth in both VidaMed's revenues and
operating income that might be available if VidaMed would add more account
representatives sooner, which will in turn drive more new accounts and exploit
larger accounts sooner and result in higher system and cartridge sales. In
addition, the accelerated case projections assume that VidaMed would incur
higher sales and marketing expense to drive utilization and higher research and
development expense to lower product cost and more aggressively pursue U.S.
clinical studies for prostatitis.

   The projections provided to VidaMed's board of directors and financial
advisor in connection with their review of the transaction included both the
base case projections and the accelerated case projections of VidaMed's
operating performance for the six-year period ending December 31, 2006. The
projections provided to Medtronic and the other bidder included only the
accelerated case projections for the three year period ending December 31, 2003.

   In preparing both sets of projections, VidaMed's management made several
assumptions about VidaMed's market, growth rates and other factors that may
affect the accuracy of the projections. Specifically, VidaMed assumed the
following:

   . Adoption of the TUNA procedure will continue to be driven by a foundation
     of clinical acceptance by urologists and attractive reimbursement rates.

   . The number of urologists in the U.S. is estimated to be around 10,000,
     made up of approximately 1,500 small group practices (three or fewer
     urologists per practice) and approximately 400 large group practices (four
     or more urologists per practice).

   . Revenue growth is driven primarily by the addition of new U.S.-based
     urology practices using the TUNA system and the monthly rate of procedures
     performed.

   . Fiscal year 2002 begins with an installed base of 228 urology
     practices/sites, with an average of 4.3 TUNA procedures per month. By
     fiscal year 2006, both the base case projections and the accelerated case
     projections assume that TUNA procedures will be performed in over 1,100,
     or more than 50%, of the available U.S. urologists practices. The
     accelerated case projections assume a higher percentage of larger accounts
     and an overall average utilization rate of 10.4 procedures per month by
     the end of fiscal year 2006 versus the base case projections that assume a
     utilization rate of 8.8 procedures per month by the end of fiscal year
     2006.

   . Gross margins will be sustainable at approximately 70% over the fiscal
     year 2002 to 2006 period. Both the base case projections and the
     accelerated case projections assume TUNA system and disposable cartridge
     price erosion in the fiscal years 2003 through fiscal year 2006, to
     account for larger account discounts and increased competition and
     potentially a reduction of reimbursement in the later years. Price erosion
     is projected to be offset by lower product costs, accomplished through
     volume discounts, design improvements and an increasing mix of higher
     margin disposable product versus system sales.

   . Operating expenses in both the accelerated case projections and base case
     projections were targeted to increase to support the growth in revenue
     while managing overall operating margins to over 30% of revenue by fiscal
     year 2004. Due to net operating loss carry forwards, income taxes do not
     become a significant issue until fiscal year 2006 and will cause a larger
     impact on the net income of the accelerated case projections than the base
     case projections.

   A summary of management's base projections is as follows:

                                                                Year Ending December 31,

   VidaMed designs, develops, and markets a minimally invasive treatment for
the urological condition, benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is commonly
referred to as BPH or enlarged prostate. Over one-half of men age 50 and older
in the United States suffer from symptomatic BPH, which if left untreated, can
lead to other adverse medical conditions, including incontinence. VidaMed's
patented transurethral needle ablation, or TUNA, procedure is designed to
provide a safe, cost effective and minimally invasive treatment for BPH and an
alternative to drug therapy and major surgery. VidaMed's TUNA procedure
delivers low-level radio frequency energy directly into the prostate, resulting
in tissue shrinkage and subsequent alleviation of symptoms associated with BPH,
with minimal patient discomfort or sensation of heat and allowing a patient to
return quickly to a normal life style.

                         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of December
5, 2001, by and among MEDTRONIC, INC., a Minnesota corporation (the "Parent"),
VIDAMED ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Parent ("Merger Sub"), and VIDAMED, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have each determined that an acquisition of the Company by the
Parent is advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders;

   WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by the Parent, the
respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
each approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, whereby each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than shares owned
directly or indirectly by the Parent or by the Company, will be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 3.3) in
accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of this Agreement;

   WHEREAS, upon execution of this Agreement, the Parent will agree to loan the
Company $5 million pursuant to a non-negotiable, secured promissory note; and

   WHEREAS, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby agree as follows:

                                  ARTICLE 1.

                                  THE MERGER

   1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware ("DGCL"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger

laws of the State of Delaware under the name "Medtronic VidaMed, Inc.".

   1.2. The Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
at 10:00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, on a date to be specified by the parties
which will be no later than the second Business Day (as defined below) after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date (as defined below)), set forth in Article 7, unless this Agreement
has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or
date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual time and date of
the Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing will
take place by telecopy exchange of signature pages with originals to follow by
overnight delivery, or in such other manner or at such place as the parties
hereto may agree. The Company will as promptly as practicable notify the
Parent, and the Parent and Merger Sub will as promptly as practicable notify
the Company, when the conditions to such party's obligation to effect the
Merger contained in Article 7 will have been satisfied. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Business Day" will mean any day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday
or other day on which the offices of the Secretary of State of the State of

Delaware, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in accordance
with the DGCL, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of, the DGCL. The parties will take such other and
further actions as may be required by law to make the Merger effective. The
Merger will become effective at the time of such filing or, if agreed to by the
Parent and the Company, at such later time or date as is set forth in the
Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

   1.4 Effect of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become

(other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
3.7)), together with the associated Company Rights (as defined in Section 4.4),
will be converted into the right to receive in cash from the Parent, without
interest, an amount equal to $7.91 (the "Merger Consideration"). At the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock, together with the
associated Company Rights (as defined in Section 4.4), will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company
Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive, upon surrender of such certificates in accordance with
Section 3.4 the Merger Consideration.

   3.4. Exchange of Certificates.

      (a) From time to time, as necessary, at or following the Effective Time,
   the Parent must make available to Computershare Investor Services, LLC or
   such other commercial bank or trust company designated by the Parent and
   reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit
   of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Cancelled
   Shares and Dissenting Shares), cash in the amount required to be exchanged
   for shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.3
   (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying
   Agent must, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash
   contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 3.3 out of the Exchange Fund.
   Except as contemplated by Section 3.4(f), the Exchange Fund must not be used
   for any other purpose.

      (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
   Parent must cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
   certificate or certificates (to the extent such certificates have not
   already been submitted to the Paying Agent) which immediately prior to the
   Effective Time represented outstanding shares (other than Cancelled Shares
   and Dissenting Shares) of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") (i) a
   letter of transmittal (which will be in customary form and will specify that
   delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
   will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent
   and will be in such form and have such other provisions as the Parent and
   the Paying Agent will reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
   effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
   Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
   previously represented by such certificates will have been converted into
   the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement.

      (c) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation,
   together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
   accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
   reasonably required by the Paying Agent pursuant to such instructions, the
   holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
   the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
   represented by such Certificate, to be distributed as soon as practicable
   after the Effective Time (after giving effect to any required tax
   withholding) in each case without interest, and the Certificate so
   surrendered will immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
   ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
   transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
   transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common
   Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
   required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
   applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until

                                      A-3

   surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4, each Certificate will be
   deemed at all times after the Effective Time for all purposes to represent
   only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration with
   respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

      (d) Cash paid upon conversion of the shares of Company Common Stock in
   accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been issued in full
   satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock
   and, following the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
   transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
   shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
   the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
   to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will be cancelled and
   exchanged as provided in this Section 3.4. From and after the Effective
   Time, holders of Certificates will cease to have any rights as stockholders
   of the Company, except as provided by law.

      (e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, any portion of the
   Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of shares of
   Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time will be delivered
   to the Parent, upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common
   Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 must thereafter
   look only, as general creditors, only to the Parent for the Merger
   Consideration, without interest. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
   unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock three years after the
   Effective Time (or such earlier date, as is immediately prior to such time
   as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
   government entity) will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
   the property of the Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
   person previously entitled thereto.

      (f) Notwithstanding Section 3.3, none of the Paying Agent, the Parent nor
   the Surviving Corporation will be liable to any holder of shares of Company
   Common Stock for any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any
   applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

      (g) The Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
   consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
   shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
   withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
   Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state,
   local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
   Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
   amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
   paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
   such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the
   Parent, as the case may be.

      (h) If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
   delivery to the Paying Agent of an affidavit of that fact by the person
   claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
   by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
   reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
   against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
   Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
   or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

   3.5. Stock Options.

      (a) Not later than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
   send a notice (the "Option Notice") to all holders of outstanding options to
   purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Options"): (i)
   specifying that such options will not be assumed in connection with the
   Merger, and (ii) specifying that any Company Options outstanding as of the
   Effective Time will terminate and be cancelled at such time and represent
   only the right to receive the consideration, if any, specified in Section
   3.5(c) in accordance with this Agreement.

      (b) The Company will permit each holder of a Company Option who desires
   to exercise all or any portion of such Company Option following receipt of
   the Option Notice to exercise such Company Option prior to the Effective
   Time.

                                      A-4

      (c) Each Company Option outstanding as of the Effective Time will by
   virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder
   thereof, be terminated and cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted
   into, and represent only, the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
   the excess, if any, of (i) the product of the Merger Consideration
   multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock which are
   issuable upon exercise of such Company Option (regardless of whether such
   Company Option is vested or not) immediately prior to the Effective Time
   over (ii) the exercise price of those shares of Company Common Stock subject
   to such Company Option. The aggregate amount payable pursuant to this
   Section 3.5(c) will hereinafter be referred to as the "Option Cash-Out
   Amount."

      (d) promptly following the Effective Time, the Parent will cause the
   Paying Agent to mail to each holder (as of the Effective Time) of a Company
   Option which was converted into the right to receive the Option Cash-Out
   Amount pursuant to Section 3.5(c) hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
   will be in such form and have such other provisions as the Parent may
   reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in receiving cash payable
   in respect of such Company Options. Upon the delivery of such letter of
   transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
   instructions thereto, together with the documentation representing the
   Company Options surrendered thereby, to the Paying Agent, the holders of
   Company Options will be entitled to receive the Option Cash-Out Amount
   payable to them in respect of such Company Options pursuant to Section
   3.5(c).

   3.6. Warrants.

      (a) Not later than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
   send a notice to the holders of outstanding warrants to purchase shares of
   Company Common Stock (the "Company Warrants"): (i) specifying that such
   warrants will not be assumed in connection with the Merger, and (ii)
   specifying that any Company Warrants outstanding as of the Effective Time
   will terminate and be cancelled at such time and represent only the right to
   receive the consideration, if any, specified in this Section 3.6(a) in
   accordance with this Agreement. At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant
   will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
   holder thereof, be converted into, and represent only, the right to receive,
   upon delivery thereof to the Company, an amount in cash equal to the excess,
   if any, of (i) the product of the Merger Consideration multiplied by the
   number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
   Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time over (ii) the
   aggregate exercise price of all such shares of Company Common Stock
   exercisable under such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
   Time. The aggregate amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.6(a) will
   hereinafter be referred to as the "Warrant Cash-Out Amount."

      (b) Promptly following the Effective Time, the Parent will cause the
   Paying Agent to mail to each holder (as of the Effective Time) of a Company
   Warrant if converted into the right to receive the Warrant Cash-Out Amount
   pursuant to Section 3.6(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (which will be in
   such form and have such other provisions as the Parent may reasonably
   specify), and (ii) instructions for use in receiving cash payable in respect
   of such Company Warrants. Upon the delivery of such letter of transmittal,
   duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
   thereto, together with the documentation representing the Company Warrant
   surrendered thereby, to the Paying Agent, the holders of Company Warrant
   will be entitled to receive the Warrant Cash-Out Amount payable to them in
   respect of such Company Warrants pursuant to Section 3.6(a).

   3.7. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 3.3, to the extent (if at
all) that holders of Common Stock are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of Dissenting Shares will
be entitled to receive from the Company such consideration as will be
determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if any
such holder will have failed to perfect or will effectively withdraw or lose
his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder's shares
of Company Common Stock will

                                      A-5

thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and
such shares will not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company will give
the Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices or demands for appraisal or payment
for shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to participate and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands or notices. The Company will not, without the prior
written consent of the Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle,
offer to settle or otherwise negotiate any demands.

                                  ARTICLE 4.

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

   Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule referred to in
Section 4.1 below, which identifies by section number the provision of this
Agreement to which such exception relates, the Company represents and warrants
to the Parent and Merger Sub as of the date hereof as follows:

   4.1. Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company has heretofore delivered to
the Parent a disclosure schedule (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), which is
divided into sections that correspond to the sections of this Article 4.

   4.2. Organization and Qualification.

      (a) The Company and each subsidiary of the Company (referred to herein as
   a "Company Subsidiary") is a corporation duly organized, validly existing,
   and in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of
   incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
   lease, and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
   conducted. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified and in
   good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property
   owned, leased, or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by
   it makes such qualification necessary and where the failure to qualify could
   reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
   below).

      (b) "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any effect, change, event,
   circumstance or condition that, individually or in the aggregate with all
   similar effects, changes, events, circumstances or conditions, is or would
   reasonably be expected to: (i) have a material adverse effect on the
   business (including its prospects, current products or products identified
   for development), operations, assets, properties, results of operations, or
   financial condition of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, with the
   Company and the Company Subsidiaries considered as a whole, (ii) prevent or
   materially delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise have a material
   adverse effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
   under this Agreement, or (iii) unless resulting from or relating to any act
   or omission of the Parent following the date hereof (other than an act or
   omission required or reasonably contemplated by this Agreement), have a
   material adverse effect on the ability of the Surviving Corporation or the
   Parent to conduct such business (as presently conducted) following the
   Effective Time or the ability of Parent to exercise full rights of ownership
   of the Company or its assets or business; provided, however, that there will
   be excluded from the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect (x) any
   adverse effect, change, event, circumstance or condition in the medical
   device industry or in the economy generally (as opposed to the Company
   specifically), and (y) any adverse effect, change, event, circumstance or
   condition that results from the Parent's refusal to permit the Company upon
   the Company's request to the Parent to take any of the actions itemized in
   Section 6.1 hereof.

      (c) Except to the extent specifically disclosed on the Company Disclosure
   Schedule, or any entity in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly,
   an equity interest of less than 1% of the fair market value of such entity's
   outstanding equity securities, neither the Company nor any Company
   Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, owns or controls or has any capital,
   equity, partnership, participation, or other ownership interest in any
   corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other business association or
   entity.

                                      A-6

   4.3. Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws. The Company
has heretofore furnished or made available to the Parent a complete and correct
copy of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Restated Bylaws of
the Company and the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, each as in full force and
effect as of the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, except where any such violation
could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

   4.4. Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
60,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"), 30,000 shares of
which are designated as Series A Participating Preferred Stock (the "Series A
Preferred Stock"). As of the date hereof, (a) 36,115,627 shares of Company
Common Stock are issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, (b) no shares of Company Common Stock are held in the
treasury of the Company, (c) no shares of Company Common Stock are held by the
Company Subsidiaries, (d) 6,849,906 shares of Company Common Stock are reserved
for future issuance pursuant to outstanding Company Options and Company
Warrants, and (e) 89,988 shares of Company Common Stock are reserved for future
issuance pursuant to the VidaMed, Inc. Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ("Company ESPP"). As of the date hereof, no shares of Company
Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding (including all of the Company
Preferred Stock being reserved for issuance in accordance with the Amended and
Restated Rights Agreement dated as of November 8, 2001, by and between the
Company and Computershare Trust Company, as amended (as amended, the "Company
Rights Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company had issued rights to purchase
the Series A Preferred Stock (the "Company Rights")). Except as set forth in
this Section 4.4 or as set forth in Section 4.4 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and except further for the Company Rights issued pursuant to the
Company Rights Agreement, there are no options, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Section 4.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately sets
forth information regarding the holder, the exercise price, the date of grant
or issuance, and the number of underlying securities issuable in respect of
each Company Warrant and Company Option. All securities of the Company subject
to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified
in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities of the Company or of any
Company Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form
of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any
other person. Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Company
Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
and except as set forth in Section 4.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each
such share is owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary, free and
clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of
first refusal, agreements, limitations on the Company's or any Company
Subsidiary's voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement
and except as contemplated by this Agreement, there are not any agreements that
relate to the voting or control of any outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock. No consent of holders of any Company Options or Company Warrants or of
participants in the Company ESPP, is required to carry out the provisions of
Sections 3.5, 3.6 and 6.10. All actions, if any, required on the part of the
Company under the Company Options, Company Warrants and the Company ESPP to
allow for the treatment of Company Options, Company Warrants and the Company
ESPP as is provided in Section 3.5, 3.6 and 6.10, have been, or prior to the
Closing will be, validly taken by the Company. In no event will the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time
(including all shares subject to then outstanding Company Options, Company
Warrants or other rights to acquire or commitments to issue shares of Company
Common Stock ) exceed 43,055,521 plus that number of shares of Company Common
Stock equal to $30,774 divided by the closing sale price of a share of Company
Common Stock at the end of the regular trading session on December 14, 2001.

                                      A-7

   4.5. Company SEC Reports; Financial Statements.

      (a) The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
   (the "SEC"), at or prior to the time due, and has heretofore made available
   to the Parent true and complete copies of, all forms, reports, schedules,
   registration statements and definitive proxy statements (together with all
   information incorporated therein by reference, the "Company SEC Reports")
   required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 1999. As of their
   respective dates, the Company SEC Reports complied as to form in all
   material respects with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
   1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or the Securities Act, as the case may
   be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
   Company SEC Reports. As of their respective dates and as of the date any
   information from such Company SEC Reports has been incorporated by
   reference, the Company SEC Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a
   material fact or omit, to state a material fact required to be stated
   therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
   the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

      (b) Each of the financial statements of the Company (including the
   related notes) included or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
   Reports (including any similar documents filed after the date of this
   Agreement) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
   accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
   with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
   accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
   statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
   basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
   thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of the
   Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
   and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the
   periods then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of
   any unaudited interim financial statements). Except for liabilities and
   obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
   practice and which could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
   in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, since the date of the
   most recent consolidated balance sheet included in the Company SEC Reports,
   neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any liabilities
   or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
   otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet
   of the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries or in the notes
   thereto.

   4.6. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section
6.5(a)) and the Schedule 13E-3 (as defined in Section 6.5(a)) will, (i) at the
time the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 is filed with the SEC or at any
time it is amended or supplemented, (ii) on the date the Proxy Statement is
first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and (iii) at the time of the
Company Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty
is made by the Company with respect to statements made in or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by the Parent or Merger Sub
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The Proxy
Statement and Schedule 13E-3 will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

   4.7. Authorization and Enforceability. The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and,
subject to obtaining the necessary approval of its stockholders, the requisite
corporate power and authority to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized and approved by the Company's Board of Directors and, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company (other than stockholder
approval) or any Company Subsidiary are necessary to authorize this Agreement,
and, subject to obtaining the approval of the Company's stockholders, no

                                      A-8

other corporate action on the part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has declared the
advisability of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief, or other equitable remedies. The Company's Board of
Directors has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and such approvals are sufficient so that neither the restrictions on "business
combinations" set forth in Section 203(a) of DGCL nor the provisions of any
other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," or other similar
anti-takeover statute or regulation nor the provisions of any applicable
anti-takeover provisions in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
Restated Bylaws of the Company will apply to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Under applicable law, the current
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and the rules of The
Nasdaq Stock Market, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date, established by the Board
of Directors of the Company in accordance with the Restated Bylaws of the
Company, applicable law and this Agreement, is the vote required for the
stockholders of the Company to adopt this Agreement.

   4.8. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as contemplated hereby or
as disclosed in Section 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since December
31, 2000, there has not been any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of
facts or development known to the Company that individually or in the
aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, except as contemplated hereby
or as disclosed in Section 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since
December 31, 2000, and except as permitted by Section 6.1, (i) the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their business in the ordinary course
of business and consistent with past practice and (ii) there has not been:

      (a) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
   distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company, or
   any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by the Company or any
   Company Subsidiary (other than any wholly-owned Subsidiary) of any
   outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity or debt securities of,
   or other ownership interests in, the Company;

      (b) any amendment of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
   Bylaws of, or of any material term of any outstanding security issued by,
   the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than any wholly-owned
   Subsidiary);

      (c) any incurrence, assumption or guarantee by the Company or any Company
   Subsidiary of any indebtedness for borrowed money other than borrowings
   under existing short term credit facilities;

      (d) any change in any method of accounting or accounting practice by the
   Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for any such change required by
   reason of a change in GAAP and concurred with by the Company's independent
   public accountants;

      (e) issuance of any equity or debt securities of the Company other than
   (i) pursuant to Company Options or Company Warrants outstanding as of
   December 31, 2000 and the issuance of Company Options after such date in the
   ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice (and the
   issuance of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto), (ii) shares of Company
   Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company ESPP, and (iii) corresponding
   issuances of Company Rights pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement;

      (f) acquisition or disposition of assets material to the Company and the
   Company Subsidiaries, except for sales of inventory in the ordinary course
   of business consistent with past practice, or any acquisition or disposition
   of capital stock of any third party (other than acquisitions or dispositions

any of their respective properties or assets may be bound; (c) require any
filing with or permit, consent, or approval of any federal, state, local, or
foreign administrative, governmental or regulatory body or authority (a
"Governmental Entity"); or (d) result in any violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under, result in the loss of any material benefit under, or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, increased payments, or acceleration under,
or result in the creation of any lien, charge, security interest, pledge or
encumbrance of any kind or nature (any of the foregoing being a "Lien") on any
of the properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any
of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
license, franchise, permit, authorization, agreement, or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or by
which it or any of its properties or assets may be bound, except, (x) in the
cases of clauses (b) or (c), where such violation, failure to make any such
filing or failure to obtain such permit, consent or approval, could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and (y) in the case of clause (d), for any such
violations, breaches, defaults, or other occurrences that could not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

   4.10. Permits. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in
possession of all registrations, franchises, grants, authorizations (including
marketing authorizations), licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Entity
necessary for each of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to manufacture,
market, sell, or distribute the Company's products or to own, lease and operate
its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the
"Permits"), except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation
of, any of the Permits could not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no suspension or cancellation
of any of the Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation
of, any of the Permits could not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

   4.11. Compliance with Laws. Except to the extent specifically disclosed on
Section 4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all activities of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary have been, and are currently being, conducted in
compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, and foreign laws,
ordinances, regulations, interpretations, judgments, decrees, injunctions,
permits, licenses, certificates, governmental requirements, orders, and other
similar items of any court or other Governmental Entity (and including those of
any nongovernmental self-regulatory agency and including environmental laws or
regulations), the failure to comply with which could reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary
has timely filed or otherwise provided all registrations, reports, data, and
other information and applications with respect to its medical device,
pharmaceutical, consumer, health care, and other governmentally regulated
products (the "Regulated Products") required to be filed with or otherwise
provided to the FDA or any other Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the
manufacture, use, or sale of the Regulated

                                     A-10

Products, has complied with all applicable requirements of the FDA or other
Governmental Entity with respect to the Regulated Products, and all regulatory
licenses or approvals in respect thereof are in full force and effect, except
where the failure to file timely such registrations, reports, data,
information, and applications or to be in compliance or the failure to have
such licenses and approvals in full force and effect could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All documentation, correspondence, reports, data, analyses and
certifications relating to or regarding any medical devices of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, filed with or delivered by or on behalf of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to any Governmental Entity was in all material
respects true and accurate when so filed or delivered, and nothing has come to
the attention of the Company that causes the Company to conclude that such
documentation, correspondence, reports, data, analyses and certifications do
not remain true and correct.

   4.12. Litigation. Except as disclosed in Section 4.12 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries that, has had or could reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree that has had or could reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

   4.13. Employee Matters. Except as set forth in Section 4.13 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule:

      (a) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any other "person"
   within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(1) of the Code, that together with the
   Company or any Company Subsidiary is considered a single employer (an
   "Affiliated Organization") pursuant to Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
   the Code or Section 3(5) or 4001(b)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income
   Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), sponsors, maintains, contributes
   to, is required to contribute to or has or could have any liability of any
   nature, whether known or unknown, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent,
   with respect to, any "employee pension benefit plan" ("Pension Plan"), as
   such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, including, without
   limitation, any such plan that is excluded from coverage by Section 4 of
   ERISA or is a "Multiemployer Plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) or
   4001(a)(3) of ERISA. To the knowledge of the Company, each such Pension Plan
   that is a Multiemployer Plan has been operated in all material respects in
   accordance with its terms and in compliance in all material respects with
   the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable law. Each
   such other Pension Plan has been operated in all material respects in
   accordance with its terms and in compliance in all material respects with
   the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable law.
   All Pensions Plans which the Company operates as plans that are qualified
   under the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code satisfy in form and
   operation all applicable qualification requirements.

      (b) Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization has or could have
   any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown, direct or indirect,
   fixed or contingent, to any Pension Plan, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
   Corporation ("PBGC") or any other person, arising directly or indirectly
   under Title IV of ERISA other than liability pursuant to Section 4007 for
   premiums which are not yet due (without regard to any waiver). No
   "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, has
   occurred with respect to any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.
   Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization has ceased operations at
   any facility or withdrawn from any Pension Plan in a manner which could
   subject the Company or Affiliated Organization to liability under Section
   4062(e), 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any Affiliated
   Organization maintains, contributes to or has participated in or agreed to
   participate in any Pension Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan. Neither the
   Company nor any Affiliated Organization has been a party to a sale of assets
   to which Section 4204 of ERISA applied with respect to which it could incur
   any withdrawal liability (including any contingent or secondary withdrawal
   liability) to any Multiemployer Plan. Neither the Company nor any Affiliated
   Organization has incurred, or has experienced an event that will, within the
   ensuing 12 months, result in, a "complete withdrawal" or "partial
   withdrawal," as such terms are defined respectively in Sections 4203 and
   4205 of ERISA, with respect to a

                                     A-11

   Pension Plan which is a Multiemployer Plan, and nothing has occurred that
   could result in such a complete or partial withdrawal. Neither the Company
   nor any Affiliated Organization has incurred a decline in contributions to
   any Multiemployer Plan such that, if the current rate of contributions
   continues, a 70 percent decline in contributions (as defined in Section 4205
   of ERISA) will occur within the next three plan years.

      (c) Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization sponsors,
   maintains, contributes to, is required to contribute to, or has or could
   have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown, direct or
   indirect, fixed or contingent, with respect to any "employee welfare benefit
   plan" ("Welfare Plan"), as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA,
   whether insured or otherwise, including, without limitation, any such plan
   that is excluded from coverage by Section 4 of ERISA or is a Multiemployer
   Plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. To the knowledge of the
   Company, each such Welfare Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan has been
   operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in
   compliance in all material respects with applicable provisions of ERISA, the
   Code and other applicable law. Each such other Welfare Plan has been
   operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in
   compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
   the Code and all other applicable law. Benefits under each Welfare Plan are
   fully insured by an insurance company unrelated to the Company or any
   Affiliated Organization. No insurance policy or contract requires or permits
   retroactive increase in premiums or payments due thereunder. Neither the
   Company nor any Affiliated Organization has established or contributed to,
   is required to contribute to or has or could have any liability of any
   nature, whether known or unknown, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent,
   with respect to any "voluntary employees' beneficiary association" within
   the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, "welfare benefit fund" within
   the meaning of Section 419 of the Code, "qualified asset account" within the
   meaning of Section 419A of the Code or "multiple employer welfare
   arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. No Welfare Plan
   which is a Multiemployer Plan imposes any post-withdrawal liability or
   contribution obligations upon the Company or any Affiliated Organization.
   Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization maintains, contributes
   to or has or could have any liability of any nature, whether known or
   unknown, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, with respect to medical,
   health, life or other welfare benefits for present or future terminated
   employees or their spouses or dependents other than as required by Part 6 of
   Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or any comparable state law.

      (d) Neither the Company nor any Affiliated Organization is a party to,
   maintains, contributes to, is required to contribute to or has or could have
   any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown, direct or indirect,
   fixed or contingent, with respect to any bonus plan, incentive plan, stock
   plan or any other current or deferred compensation (other than current
   salary or wages paid in the form of cash), separation, retention, severance,
   paid time off, or similar agreement, arrangement or policy, or any
   individual employment, consulting or personal service agreement other than a
   Pension Plan or Welfare Plan ("Compensation Plans"). Each Compensation Plan
   has been operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
   in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of all
   applicable law.

      (e) There are no facts or circumstances which could, directly or
   indirectly, subject the Company or any Affiliated Organization to any (1)
   excise tax or other liability under Chapters 43, 46 or 47 of Subtitle D of
   the Code, (2) penalty tax or other liability under Chapter 68 of Subtitle F
   of the Code or (3) civil penalty, damages or other liabilities arising under
   Section 502 of ERISA.

      (f) Full payment has been made of all amounts which the Company or any
   Affiliated Organization is required, under applicable law, the terms of any
   Pension Plan, Welfare Plan or Compensation Plan (each, a "Plan" and,
   collectively, "Plans"), or any agreement relating to any Plan, to have paid
   as a contribution, premium or other remittance thereto or benefit
   thereunder. Each Pension Plan that is subject to the minimum funding
   standards of Section 412 of the Code and/or Section 302 of ERISA meets those
   standards and has not incurred any accumulated funding deficiency within the
   meaning of Section 412 or 418B of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no
   waiver of any minimum funding requirements has been applied for or obtained
   with respect to any Pension Plan. The Company and each Affiliated
   Organization has made

                                     A-12

   adequate provisions for reserves or accruals in accordance with GAAP to meet
   contribution, benefit or funding obligations arising under applicable law or
   the terms of any Plan or related agreement. There will be no change on or
   before Closing Date in the operation of any Plan or any documents with
   respect thereto which will result in an increase in the benefit liabilities
   under such Plans, except as may be required by law.

      (g) The Company and each Affiliated Organization has timely complied in
   all material respects with all reporting and disclosure obligations with
   respect to the Plans imposed by the Code, ERISA or other applicable law.

      (h) There are no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
   audits, investigations, claims, suits, grievances or other proceedings, and
   there are no facts that could give rise thereto, involving, directly or
   indirectly, any Plan, or any rights or benefits thereunder, other than the
   ordinary and usual claims for benefits by participants, dependents or
   beneficiaries.

      (i) The transactions contemplated herein do not result in any payment
   (whether of severance pay or otherwise), forgiveness of debt, distribution,
   increase in benefits, obligation to fund, or the acceleration of accrual,
   vesting, funding or payment of any contribution or benefit under any Plan.
   Except to the extent specifically disclosed on Section 4.13 of the Company
   Disclosure Schedule, no amount that could be received (whether in cash or
   property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
   contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, officer, or director of the
   Company or any of its affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such
   term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
   Plan currently in effect would be an "excess parachute payment" (as such
   term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

      (j) No action or omission of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
   director, officer, employee, or agent thereof in any way restricts, impairs
   or prohibits the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or the Company, any
   Company Subsidiary or any successor from amending, merging, or terminating
   any Plan in accordance with the express terms of any such plan and
   applicable law.

      (k) Section 4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists and the Company
   has delivered or made available to the Parent true and complete copies of:
   (i) all Plans and related trust agreements or other agreements or contracts
   evidencing any funding vehicle with respect thereto; (ii) the three most
   recent annual reports on Treasury Form 5500, including all schedules and
   attachments thereto, with respect to any Plan for which such a report is
   required; (iii) the three most recent actuarial reports with respect to any
   Pension Plan that is a "defined benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
   414(j) of the Code; (iv) the form of summary plan description, including any
   summary of material modifications thereto or other modifications
   communicated to participants, currently in effect with respect to each Plan;
   (v) the most recent determination letter with respect to each Pension Plan
   intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and the full and
   complete application therefor submitted to the Internal Revenue Service; and
   (vi) all professional opinions, material internal memoranda, material
   correspondence with regulatory authorities and administrative policies,
   manuals, interpretations and the like with respect to each Plan.

   4.14. Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a
party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract
applicable to persons employed by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout, or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threat thereof, by or with respect to any
employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

   4.15. Real Property and Leases.

      (a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have sufficient title or
   leasehold interests to all their properties and assets to conduct their
   respective businesses as currently conducted, with only such exceptions as,
   individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
   Company Material Adverse Effect.

                                     A-13

      (b) All leases of real property leased for the use or benefit of the
   Company or any Company Subsidiary to which the Company or any Company
   Subsidiary is a party, and all amendments and modifications thereto are in
   full force and effect, and there exists no material default under any such
   lease by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor any event which with
   notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a material default
   thereunder by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, which would permit any
   such lease to be terminated by the other party thereto.

   4.16. Intellectual Property.

      (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure
   Schedule, to the Company's knowledge, the Company and the Company
   Subsidiaries own, free and clear of any Lien, or are licensed to use, all
   Intellectual Property (as defined hereafter) reasonably necessary for the
   Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct their business as it is
   currently conducted (the "Company Intellectual Property"), except as could
   not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
   Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
   complete list of all (i) issued or pending non-expired patent applications,
   patents, design applications, design patents or registered industrial
   designs, utility model applications and utility model registrations owned by
   the Company, (ii) trademark applications, registered, pending and material
   unregistered trademarks for the Company, and (iii) registered copyrights,
   copyright applications, and domain names. Except as set forth in Section
   4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Company
   Subsidiaries own, free and clear of any Lien all patent applications,
   patents, design applications, design patents or registered industrial
   designs, utility model applications, utility model registrations, trademark
   applications and trademark registrations listed in Section 4.16(a) of the
   Company Disclosure Schedule.

      (b) (i) All of the registrations relating to Company Intellectual
   Property are subsisting and unexpired, and have not been abandoned, except
   as set forth in Section 4.16 of the Disclosure Schedule or as could not
   reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) to
   the knowledge of the Company, neither the use of the Company Intellectual
   Property by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the present conduct of
   its business or as proposed to be conducted as described in the Company's
   written business plans presented to the Company's Board of Directors, nor
   the manufacture, marketing, distribution, use or sale of any current product
   or service of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any proposed product
   identified for development by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the
   Company's written business plans presented to the Company's Board of
   Directors, infringes on the Intellectual Property rights of any person;
   (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, no judgment, decree, injunction, rule
   or order has been rendered by any Governmental Entity which would limit,
   cancel or question the validity of any Company Intellectual Property, or the
   Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' rights in and to any Company
   Intellectual Property, in any respect that could reasonably be expected to
   have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;
   (iv) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received notice of
   any pending or threatened suit, action or adversarial proceeding that seeks
   to limit, cancel or question the validity of any Company Intellectual
   Property, or the Company's or its Subsidiaries' rights in and to any Company
   Intellectual Property, which could reasonably be expected to have,
   individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and (v)
   neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any notice or
   communication of any pending or threatened suit, action or adversarial
   proceeding or claim that the manufacture, marketing, distribution, use or
   sale of any current product or service of the Company or any Company
   Subsidiary or any proposed product identified for development by the Company
   or any Company Subsidiary in the Company's written business plans presented
   to the Company's Board of Directors, infringes on the Intellectual Property
   rights of any person.

      (c) For purposes of this Agreement "Intellectual Property" will mean all
   rights, privileges and priorities provided under U.S., state and foreign law
   relating to intellectual property, including all (x) (1) proprietary
   inventions, discoveries, processes, formulae, designs, methods, techniques,
   procedures, concepts, developments, technology, new and useful improvements
   thereof and proprietary know-how relating thereto, whether or not patented
   or eligible for patent protection; (2) copyrights and copyrightable

                                     A-14

   works, including computer applications, programs, software, databases and
   related items; (3) trademarks, service marks, trade names, and trade dress,
   the goodwill of any business symbolized thereby, and all common-law rights
   relating thereto; (4) trade secrets and other confidential information; (y)
   all registrations, applications, and recordings for, and amendments,
   modifications and improvements to any of the foregoing and (z) licenses or
   other similar agreements granting to the Company or any of the Company
   Subsidiaries the rights to use any of the foregoing.

      (d) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company
   Subsidiary has used or made use of any confidential or proprietary
   information or trade secrets of any other person in breach of any agreement
   to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary of the Company is subject or
   in violation of any civil or criminal law, except as could not reasonably be
   expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

      (e) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has taken commercially
   reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and
   value of its trade secrets, except as could not reasonably be expected to
   have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

      (f) To the knowledge of the Company, all employees of the Company and
   each Company Subsidiary that have developed Intellectual Property in
   connection with their employment with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
   have executed written agreements with the Company or such Company Subsidiary
   requiring the employee to assign to the Company or such Company Subsidiary
   all rights to such Intellectual Property. To the Company's knowledge, no
   employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has entered into any
   agreement that restricts or limits in any way the scope or type of work in
   which the employee may be engaged or requires the employee to transfer,
   assign or disclose any Intellectual Property or information concerning the
   employee's work to anyone other than the Company or such Company Subsidiary,
   except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
   Adverse Effect.

   4.17. Taxes. The Company and each Company Subsidiary (a) have properly
prepared and timely filed or will have prepared and filed all federal, state,
local and foreign tax returns and reports in respect of taxes required to be
filed by or with respect to the Company and each Company Subsidiary through the
Effective Time (taking into account any extension of time to file); (b) paid or
accrued all taxes shown to be due on such returns and reports (and all
applicable ad valorem and value added taxes as are due from the Company and
each Company Subsidiary have been paid); and (c) paid or accrued all taxes for
which a notice of assessment or collection has been received by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (other than those being contested or which the Company
intends to contest in good faith by appropriate proceedings). Neither the
Internal Revenue Service nor any other taxing authority has asserted any claim
for taxes, or to the knowledge of the Company, is threatening to assert any
claims for taxes from the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company and
each Company Subsidiary have withheld or collected and paid over to appropriate
governmental authorities (or are properly holding for such payment) all taxes
required by law to be withheld or collected by them. There are no liens for
taxes upon the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than
liens for taxes that are not yet due or that are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings).

   4.18. Material Contracts. As of the date hereof, except as disclosed in
Section 4.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any "material contracts"
(as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K); (ii) any joint
ventures, partnerships, or similar arrangements; (iii) other agreements or
arrangements that give rise to a right of the other parties thereto to
terminate such material contract or to a right of first refusal or similar
right thereunder as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; or (iv) any agreements, licenses or other arrangements
that contain exclusive grants of rights that could, after the Effective Time,
restrict the Parent or any of its affiliates or any successor thereto, from
engaging in or competing with any line of business or in any geographic area
(collectively, the "Company Material Contracts"). The Company has provided or
made available to the Parent a

                                     A-15

true and accurate copy of all Company Material Contracts and all such Company
Material Contracts are valid and in full force and effect, except to the extent
they have previously expired in accordance with their terms or if the failure
to be in full force and effect, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has violated any provision of, or
committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Company
Material Contract, except in each case for those violations and defaults which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

   4.19. Suppliers. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
any notice or has any reason to believe that any significant supplier will not
sell raw materials, supplies, merchandise and other goods to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary at any time after the Effective Time on terms and conditions
substantially similar to those used in its current sales to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, subject only to general and customary price increases,
unless comparable raw materials, supplies, merchandise or other goods are
readily available from other sources on comparable terms and conditions.

   4.20. Environmental Matters.

      (a) The Company: (i) is in compliance with all applicable Environmental
   Laws (which compliance includes, but is not limited to, the possession by
   the Company and the Company Subsidiaries of all permits and other
   governmental authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws,
   and compliance with the terms and conditions thereof), except for such
   non-compliance which could not reasonably be expected, individually or in
   the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) has not
   received any communication (written or oral) from a Governmental Entity or
   third party that alleges that the Company is not in compliance with
   applicable Environmental Laws; (iii) has not owned or operated any property
   that is contaminated with any Hazardous Material which may be expected to
   require remediation under any Environmental Law; (iv) is not subject to
   liability for any disposal or contamination (whether on-site or off-site) of
   any Hazardous Material; and (v) is not subject to any other circumstances in
   connection with any Environmental Law that could reasonably be expected to
   have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Banc of America Securities LLC dated November 8, 2001, no act of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has given or will give rise to any claim against any of

                             PARENT AND MERGER SUB

   The Parent and Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant
to the Company as of the date hereof as follows:

   5.1. Organization and Qualification. Each of the Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the
laws of the state of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease, and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of the Parent and Merger Sub and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased, or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary and
where the failure to qualify could reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). "Parent Material Adverse Effect"
means any effect, change, event, circumstance or condition that, individually
or in the aggregate with all similar effects, changes, events, circumstances or
conditions, is or would reasonably be expected to: (i) have a material adverse
effect on the business (including its prospects, current products or products
identified for development), operations, assets, properties, results of
operations, or financial condition of the Parent and its subsidiaries,
considered as a whole, or (ii) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
Parent to perform its obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that
there will be excluded from the definition of Parent Material Adverse Effect
any adverse effect, change, event, circumstance or condition in the medical
device industry or in the economy generally (as opposed to the Parent
specifically).

   5.2. Ownership of Merger Sub. Merger Sub is a direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Parent.

   5.3. Authorization. Each of the Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized and
approved by the Boards of Directors of the Parent and Merger Sub and by the
Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. No vote
of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock of the Parent is
necessary to approve this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of the
Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its
terms, subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief, or other equitable remedies.

   5.4. Consents and Approvals. Except for (i) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state takeover and
securities laws and the HSR Act, (ii) the filing and

recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and the rules
of the NYSE and Nasdaq, and (iii) compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights of the Company's stockholders, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not: (a) violate any provision of the
Articles or Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Parent or Merger Sub
or the comparable organizational documents any of the Parent's subsidiaries;
(b) violate any statute, rule, regulation, order, or decree of any federal,
state, local or foreign body or authority by which the Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets may be bound; (c) require any filing with or permit, consent, or
approval of any Governmental Entity; or (d) result in any violation or breach
of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default under, result in the loss of any material benefit under, or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation, increased payments, or acceleration
under, or result in the creation of any Lien on any of the properties or assets
of the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries under, any of
the terms, conditions, or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
license, franchise, permit, agreement, or other instrument or obligation to
which the Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries is a
party, or by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets
may be bound, except (x) in the cases of clauses (b) or (c), where such
violation, failure to make any such filing or failure to obtain such permit,
consent or approval, could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (y) in the case of
clause (d), for any such violations, breaches, defaults, or other occurrences
that could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

   5.5. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their subsidiaries, for

Schedule 13E-3 will, (i) at the time the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3
is filed with the SEC or at any time it is amended and supplemented, (ii) on
the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of the
Company, and (iii) at the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to statements made in or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein. The Schedule 13E-3 and the portion of
Proxy Statement based on information supplied by the Parent or Merger Sub for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

   5.6. Litigation. There are no suits, actions or proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of the Parent or Merger Sub, threatened against or affecting the
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries that could
reasonably be expected to prevent, hinder or delay the timely completion of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

   5.7. Interim Operations of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has
not engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other than
in connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder.

   5.8. No Finders. No act of the Parent or Merger Sub has given or will give
rise to any claim against any of the parties hereto for a brokerage commission,
finder's fee, or other like payment in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein.

   5.9 Financing. The Parent has or at the Effective Time, the Parent will
have, and will make available to Merger Sub, the funds necessary to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and otherwise to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

   Company or the Company's Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to
   the Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated
   under the Exchange Act or from making any legally required disclosure to the
   Company's stockholders.

      (b) As used in this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any
   offer or proposal for (i) a transaction or series of related transactions
   pursuant to which any person (or "group" of persons as such term is defined
   under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than the Parent or Merger Sub
   (a "Third Party") acquires 25% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
   Common Stock, including without limitation a tender offer or an exchange
   offer which, if consummated, would result in a Third Party acquiring 25% or
   more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) a merger or
   other business combination involving the Company pursuant to which any Third
   Party acquires securities representing 25% or more of the aggregate voting

   Third Party acquires control of assets (including for this purpose the
   outstanding equity securities of any Company Subsidiary) of the Company
   having a fair market value equal to 25% or more of the fair value of all of
   the assets of the Company immediately prior to such a transaction.

      (c) As used in this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" will mean a bona
   fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company has
   reasonably and in good faith determined after consultation with, among other
   persons, its financial advisors and outside counsel, to be more favorable to
   the Company's stockholders than the Merger, taking into account all relevant
   factors (including whether, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
   Directors of the Company, such third party is reasonably able to finance the
   transaction and all regulatory approvals required in such transaction could
   reasonably be obtained).

      (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.3(a), this Agreement will
   not prohibit the Company's Board of Directors from, prior to the date on
   which the Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement in accordance with the
   DGCL, furnishing nonpublic information to or entering into discussions or
   negotiations with, any Third Party that makes an unsolicited Superior
   Proposal, if, and only to the extent that, (i) the failure of the Company's
   Board of Directors to take action with respect to a Superior Proposal would
   be a breach of the Board's fiduciary duties to its stockholders imposed by
   applicable law; (ii) prior to first furnishing nonpublic information to, or
   first entering into substantive discussions and negotiations with, such
   Third Party after the date hereof, the Company (A) provides written notice
   of at least five Business Days to the Parent to the effect that it intends
   to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with,
   such Third Party, and naming and identifying the Third Party making the
   Acquisition Proposal, and (B) receives from such Third Party an executed
   confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than
   the Confidentiality Agreement dated June 4, 2001 between the Company and the
   Parent; and (iii) the Company concurrently provides the Parent with all
   non-public information to be provided to such Third Party that the Parent
   has not previously received from the Company, and the

                                     A-22

   Company keeps Parent reasonably informed of the status and the material
   terms and conditions and all other material information with respect to any
   such discussions or negotiations.

      (e) The Company agrees that it will notify the Parent within two (2)
   Business Days if it or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition
   Proposal or any inquiry reasonably likely to lead to a Acquisition Proposal
   or if any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
   continued with the Company or its Representatives concerning an Acquisition
   Proposal, and such notification will contain the name of the Third Party
   involved and the material terms and conditions of such an Acquisition
   Proposal.

      (f) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company will immediately
   terminate all discussions with Third Parties concerning any Acquisition
   Proposal, and will request that such Third Parties promptly return any
   confidential information furnished by the Company in connection with any
   Acquisition Proposal. The Company will not waive any provision of any
   confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement entered into with any Third
   Party regarding any Acquisition Proposal, and prior to the Closing will
   enforce all such agreements in accordance with their terms.

      (g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 will (i) permit the Company to
   terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article 8
   hereof), or (ii) permit the Company to enter into any agreement providing
   for an Acquisition Proposal (other than the confidentiality agreement as
   provided, and in the circumstances and under the conditions set forth,
   above) for as long as this Agreement remains in effect.

   6.4. Company Stockholders Meeting.

      (a) The Company will promptly take all action necessary in accordance
   with the DGCL and the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
   Restated Bylaws to cause a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
   Stockholders' Meeting") to be duly called and held to consider and vote upon
   the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and the Company
   will use its commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Company
   Stockholders' Meeting as soon as practicable after the date of this
   Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company will, subject to Section
   6.4(b), recommend such approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
   Merger and will take all lawful action to solicit such approval, including,
   without limitation, timely mailing the Proxy Statement, unless such
   recommendation or solicitation would be a breach of the Company's Board of
   Directors' fiduciary duties to its stockholders imposed by applicable law.

      (b) The Board of Directors of the Company will not withdraw, or modify in
   a manner adverse to the Parent, its recommendation to its stockholders
   unless (i) the Company has complied with the terms of Section 6.3 in all
   material respects, including, without limitation, the requirement in Section
   6.3 that it notify the Parent after its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal,
   and (ii) such withdrawal or modification is required under applicable law in
   order for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary
   duties to its stockholders. Any withdrawal or modification of the
   recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors in accordance with the
   previous sentence will not constitute a breach of the Company's
   representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
   Agreement. Unless this Agreement is previously terminated in accordance with
   Article 8, the Company will submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the
   Company Stockholders' Meeting even if the Board of Directors of the Company
   determines at any time after the date hereof that it is no longer advisable
   or recommends that the Company stockholders reject it (and not postpone or
   adjourn such meeting or the vote by the Company's stockholders upon this
   Agreement and the Merger to another date without the Parent's approval).

      (c) The Parent will vote (or consent with respect to) any shares of
   common stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it, or with respect to
   which it has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be
   voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
   at any meeting of the stockholders of Merger Sub at which this Agreement
   will be submitted for adoption and at all adjournments

                                     A-23

   or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of the
   stockholders of Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting).

   6.5. Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3

      (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
   Company and the Parent will jointly prepare a Rule 13E-3 Transaction

   with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Proxy Statement and
   any amendment or supplement thereto, will be subject to the prior review of
   the Parent and all mailings to the Company's stockholders in connection with
   the transaction contemplated by this Agreement will be subject to the prior

   with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Schedule 13E-3 and
   any amendment or supplement thereto, will be subject to the prior review of

   and, if necessary, satisfactory resolution of SEC comments. The Company will
   also promptly file, and, if required, mail to the Company's stockholders,

   date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's stockholders. The
   Company and the Parent will also promptly file any amendment to the Schedule
   13E-3 which may become necessary after the date the Schedule 13E-3 is first
   filed with the SEC.

      (b) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
   13E-3 will be made by the Company without the approval of the Parent, which
   approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company will
   advise the Parent promptly after it receives notice thereof of any request
   by the SEC or Nasdaq for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
   13E-3 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
   additional information.

      (c) The Proxy Statement will include the recommendation of the Board of
   Directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company that they vote
   in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, except as
   otherwise provided in Section 6.3 or 6.4 of this Agreement.

   any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstances relating to
   the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or their respective officers
   and directors, should be discovered by the Company that should be set forth
   in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
   13E-3, the Company will promptly inform the Parent. All documents that the
   Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
   transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form in all material
   respects with the applicable requirements of the DGCL, the Securities Act,
   the Exchange Act and Nasdaq.

                                     A-24

      (e) The information supplied by the Parent included in the Schedule 13E-3
   or for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at (i) the time the Proxy

   the Proxy Statement, the Parent will promptly inform the Company. All
   documents that the Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in
   connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form
   in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the DGCL, the
   Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and Nasdaq.

   6.6. Confidentiality. The Parent and the Company will comply with, and will
cause their respective representatives to comply with, in all respects, all of
their respective obligations under the confidentiality agreement between the
parties dated June 4, 2001 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and in no event,
will the negotiation, entering into or termination of this Agreement be deemed
to waive or otherwise adversely affect the rights and obligations of the
parties under the Confidentiality Agreement, which rights and obligations will
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

   6.7. Access to Information.

      (a) Except as required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or
   similar agreement or arrangement to which the Company or any of the Company
   Subsidiaries is a party (in which case the Company will use all commercially
   reasonable efforts to provide acceptable alternative arrangements, not in
   violation of such agreement or arrangement, for disclosure to the Parent or
   its advisors) or pursuant to applicable law, the Company will afford to the
   Parent and to the Parent's accountants, officers, directors, employees,
   counsel, and other representatives reasonable access during normal business
   hours upon reasonable prior notice, from the date hereof through the
   Effective Time, to all of its properties, books, data, contracts,
   commitments, and records, and, during such period, the Company will furnish
   promptly to the Parent all information concerning the Company's and the
   Company Subsidiaries' businesses, prospects, properties, liabilities,
   results of operations, financial condition, product evaluations and testing,
   pilot studies, clinical data and studies and evaluations, patient results,
   regulatory compliance, officers, employees, third party clinical
   investigators, consultants, distributors, customers, suppliers, and others
   having dealings with the Company as the Parent may reasonably request and
   reasonable opportunity to contact and obtain information from such officers,
   employees, investigators, consultants, distributors, customers, suppliers,
   and others having dealings with the Company as the Parent may reasonably
   request. The Company's obligation to afford access and provide information
   pursuant to the preceding sentence will include, without limitation, such
   access and information as the Parent will deem necessary to enable the
   Parent, or a third party designated by the Parent, to conduct a full audit
   of the Company's product performance and quality, pilot studies, clinical
   data and results, patient results, compliance with FDA regulations, policies
   and procedures, QSR compliance, manufacturing scale-up relations and
   dealings with third party physicians and other clinical investigators and
   consultants, and related performance,  manufacturing, and compliance matters
   concerning the Company's products. During the period from the date hereof to
   the Effective Time, the parties will in good faith meet and correspond on a
   regular basis for mutual consultation concerning the conduct of the
   Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' businesses and, in connection
   therewith, Parent will be entitled to be kept informed concerning, the
   Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' operations and business planning.

      (b) No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.7 will affect any
   representation or warranty contained herein of any party hereto or any
   condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

                                     A-25

   6.8. Approvals and Consents; Cooperation.

      (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
   Agreement, each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each other and to
   use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be
   taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
   cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
   advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
   practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
   Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) the obtaining of all necessary
   actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
   Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, submissions of
   information, applications and filings (including filings with Governmental
   Entities) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
   obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
   any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining and maintenance of all necessary
   consents, approvals, permits, authorizations and other confirmations or
   waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
   legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, investigating or
   challenging this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions
   contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
   temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
   Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
   additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
   by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

      (b) The Parent and the Company will file as soon as practicable after the
   date of this Agreement notifications under the HSR Act, if required, and
   will respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries or requests
   received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the
   Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and will
   respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries and requests received
   from any State Attorney General or other Governmental Entity in connection
   with the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties will cooperate with
   each other in connection with the making of all such filings or responses,
   including providing copies of all such documents to the other party and its
   advisors prior to filing or responding. The Parent and Merger Sub agree to
   use their respective reasonable efforts to avoid the entry of (or, if
   entered, to lift, vacate or reverse) any order, decree, judgment or ruling
   of any court or Governmental Entity restraining or preventing the
   consummation of the Merger on the basis of any federal, state or local
   antitrust laws or regulations. Concurrently with the filing of notifications
   under the HSR Act or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Company and the
   Parent will each request early termination of HSR Act waiting period.
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
   any of its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, will be required (and
   the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree,
   but will, if so directed by Parent, agree, effective after the Effective
   Time) to hold separate or divest any of their respective assets or
   operations or enter into any consent decree or licensing or other
   arrangement with respect to any of their assets or operations or to
   otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of
   action with respect to, or its ability to retain, as of and after the
   Effective Time any businesses or assets of the Company, the Parent or any of
   their respective affiliates.

      (c) Each of the Company and the Parent will promptly inform the other
   party of any material communication received by such party from the Federal
   Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any
   other governmental or regulatory authority regarding any of the transactions
   contemplated hereby.

   6.9. Employee Benefits and Employee Matters. From and after the Effective
Time, the Parent will provide, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, employee benefits and programs ("Parent Employee Benefit Plans") to
the Company's employees that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable or
more favorable, as a whole, than those in existence as of the date hereof and
provided or made available to the Parent prior to the execution hereof;
provided that stock-based compensation will be comparable to that offered by
the Parent and its subsidiaries generally. To the extent the Parent satisfies
its obligations under this Section 6.9 by maintaining Company benefit plans,
the Parent will not be required to include employees of the Company in

                                     A-26

Parent Employee Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Time, the Parent
will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, grant all employees of the
Company and any Company Subsidiaries credit under any Parent Employee Benefit
Plans for purposes of eligibility, level of participation and vesting under
each employee benefit plan or arrangement maintained by Parent or the Company
for such employees service with the Company (provided, however, that no such
past service credit will be granted to the extent it would result in
duplicative accrual of benefits for the same period of service). Under no
circumstances shall employees receive credit for service accrued or deemed
accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or a Company Subsidiary,
as the case may be, for benefit accruals under any employee pension benefit
plan (as defined by Section 3(2) of ERISA) or any retiree health plan. The
Company will use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause executives and
other key employees of the Company designated by the Parent to enter into
agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Parent with the Surviving Corporation
as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement.

   6.10. Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company will take all
actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP in order that (i)
no new Offering Periods (as defined in the Company ESPP) under such plan shall
commence following the expiration of the current Offering Period which ends on
December 31, 2001 and (ii) the Company ESPP will terminate immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

   6.11. Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby will be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses, except that the Parent and the Company will share equally all the
costs of the filing fees required under the HSR Act and the filing fees
required in connection with the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3.

   6.12. Further Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided
and without being required to waive any conditions herein (whether absolute,
discretionary, or otherwise), each of the parties hereto agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement will take all such necessary action.

   6.13. Officers' and Directors' Indemnification.

      (a) The Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that the Surviving
   Corporation will provide to the directors and officers of the Company
   indemnification to the fullest extent provided by its Certificate of
   Incorporation and Bylaws with respect to matters occurring prior to the
   Effective Time, including without limitation the authorization of this
   Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby until the six year
   anniversary date of the Effective Time (or, in case of matters occurring
   prior to the Effective Time giving rise to claims that are made prior to but
   which have not been resolved by the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
   until such matters are finally resolved).

      (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Parent will,
   at its selection, either: (i) cause to be maintained in effect the Company's
   current directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a copy of which
   has been heretofore delivered or made available to the Parent or its
   advisors) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
   at or prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) extend the discovery or reporting
   period under the Company's current policy for six years from the Effective
   Time to maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance with
   respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to
   the Effective Time for those persons who are currently covered by the
   Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms no
   less favorable than the terms of such current insurance policy; or (iii)
   substitute coverage under the Parent's directors' and officers' liability
   insurance or coverage under other policies providing coverage on terms and
   conditions that are no less advantageous to

                                     A-27

   such persons than the Company's current insurance with respect to claims
   arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective
   Time; provided, however, that in no event will the Parent be required to
   expend for any such coverage an amount per year in excess of 100% of the
   annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
   provided further that if the cost per year of such coverage exceeds such
   100% amount, Parent will be obligated to obtain such coverage as is
   available for a cost per year not exceeding such amount. The Company
   represents that the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the annual
   premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance.

      (c) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 6.13 and
   not in limitation thereof (but without in any way limiting or modifying the
   obligations of any insurance carrier contemplated by this Section 6.13), the
   Parent will guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation to honor
   all indemnification obligations under the Company's Restated Certificate of
   Incorporation, the Company's Restated Bylaws and any indemnification
   agreements between the Company and any person (all copies of which have been
   previously provided or made available to Parent) as same exist, if at all,
   as of the date hereof.

   6.14. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company will give prompt written
notice to the Parent, and the Parent will give prompt written notice to the
Company, of (a) the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event the occurrence,
or nonoccurrence, of which would be likely to cause any representation or
warranty contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at
or prior to the Effective Date and (b) any material failure of the Company or
the Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.14 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

   6.15. Term Loan. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Parent will loan the
Company $5 million pursuant to a non-negotiable, secured promissory note in
substantially the form of Exhibit B attached hereto (the "Note").

   case of any consent or waiver from a Governmental Entity) and in full force
