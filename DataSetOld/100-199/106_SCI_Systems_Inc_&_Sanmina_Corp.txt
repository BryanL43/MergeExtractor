                  WE ARE PROPOSING A MERGER OF SANMINA AND SCI

Q:   WHAT IS THE PROPOSED MERGER? (SEE PAGE 42)

A.   In the proposed merger, SCI will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
     Sanmina. SCI will survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
     Sanmina. The merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
     statement/prospectus as Annex A. You are encouraged to read it carefully.

Q:   WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER? (SEE PAGES 42 AND 69)

A.   Following the merger:

     - SCI stockholders will receive, in exchange for each of their shares of
       SCI common stock, 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock.

     - Each option to purchase SCI common stock outstanding immediately before
       the completion of the merger will automatically become an option to
       purchase shares of Sanmina common stock. The number of shares of Sanmina
       common stock which may be purchased under each assumed option will be
       equal to the product of the number of SCI shares that were purchasable
       before the merger multiplied by 1.36, rounded down to the nearest number
       of whole shares of Sanmina common stock. The exercise price per share
       will be the pre-merger exercise price divided by 1.36 and rounded up to
       the nearest whole cent.

     - Instead of fractional shares in the merger, SCI stockholders will receive
       cash in an amount equal to the fraction multiplied by the average closing
       prices reported on the Nasdaq National Market System for Sanmina common
       stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the effective date
       of the merger.

Q:   WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE COMPLETED?

A.   Sanmina and SCI are working toward completing the merger as quickly as
     possible. We hope to complete the merger no later than the end of the
     fourth calendar quarter of 2001.

Q:   ARE THERE RISKS INVOLVED IN UNDERTAKING THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 20)

A.   Yes. In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the factors
     discussed in the section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled
     "Risk Factors" beginning on page 21.

Q:   ARE THERE CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER? (SEE PAGES 75-76)

A.   Yes. Sanmina's and SCI's respective obligations to complete the merger are
     subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain specified closing
     conditions. If either Sanmina or SCI waives any conditions, each company
     will consider the facts and circumstances at that time and make a
     determination whether a resolicitation of proxies from its respective
     stockholders is appropriate.

Q:   IS THE MERGER SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS? (SEE PAGES 66-67)

A.   Yes. This merger is subject to review by the Department of Justice and the
     Federal Trade Commission to determine whether it is in compliance with
     applicable antitrust laws. The merger is also subject to the approval of
     the European Commission under the competition laws of the European Union,
     and the Competition Bureau of Canada under the competition laws of Canada.
     Under the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
     1976, as amended, and the competition laws of the European Union and
     Canada, the merger may not be consummated until the specified waiting
     period requirements under those laws have been satisfied. Sanmina and SCI
     also have filed a premerger notification form with the antitrust agency in
     Brazil and may be required to file a premerger notification form with the
     antitrust agency in Mexico, and possibly other countries, and observe any
     applicable waiting periods before closing the merger. The merger may also
     be subject to regulatory review by other U.S. governmental authorities and
     by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions.

Q:   WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVALS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 74)

A.   The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of
     Sanmina common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting
     must approve the issuance of Sanmina common stock to SCI stockholders in
     the merger. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
     the shares of Sanmina common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the
     record date must approve the changing of Sanmina's corporate name to
     [          ] effective upon the consummation of the merger.

     The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of
     SCI common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date must
     approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger.

Q:   ARE THERE ANY STOCKHOLDERS ALREADY COMMITTED TO VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE
     MERGER AND THE SHARE ISSUANCE? (SEE PAGE 79)

A.   Yes.

       outstanding Sanmina common stock as of [               ], 2001 entered

     - Jure Sola, as co-chairman and chief executive officer of Sanmina;

     - A. Eugene Sapp, Jr., as co-chairman of Sanmina;

     - Randy Furr, as president and chief operating officer of Sanmina;

     - Rick Ackel, as chief financial officer of Sanmina; and

     - Robert C. Bradshaw, as president of EMS operations of Sanmina.

            OUR REASONS FOR PROPOSING THE MERGER OF SANMINA AND SCI

Q:   WHY ARE SANMINA AND SCI PROPOSING THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 45)

A.   The boards of directors of Sanmina and SCI believe that a combined company
     would be better positioned to compete in the global electronics
     manufacturing services market and will create the opportunity for Sanmina
     and SCI to:

     - build an industry-leading electronics manufacturing services company that
       is able to provide customers with a full range of manufacturing services;

     - enhance their ability to serve their existing customer base through
       increased scale and a broader global presence;

     - utilize Sanmina's fabrication capabilities across a larger revenue base
       to realize additional operating efficiencies; and

     - compete more effectively for original equipment manufacturer divestitures
       and other acquisition transactions.

Q:   DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SANMINA RECOMMEND VOTING IN FAVOR OF
     ADOPTING THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND APPROVING THE MERGER, THE SHARE ISSUANCE
     AND THE NAME CHANGE? (SEE PAGES 45-47)

A.   Yes. After careful consideration, the members of Sanmina's board of
     directors unanimously recommends that Sanmina stockholders vote in favor of
     approving the issuance of Sanmina common stock in the merger and the change
     of Sanmina's corporate name.

Q:   DOES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SCI RECOMMEND VOTING IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER
     AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER? (SEE PAGES 47-49)

A.   Yes. After careful consideration, SCI's board of directors unanimously
     recommends that its stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of
     the merger agreement and the approval of the merger.

Q:   DO PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE MERGER HAVE INTERESTS WHICH MAY CONFLICT WITH
     MINE? (SEE PAGE 63)

A.   Yes. When considering the recommendations of Sanmina's and SCI's respective
     boards of directors, you should be aware that certain SCI directors and
     officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in
     addition to, yours. These interests include the employment of the SCI
     executive officers by Sanmina or the SCI subsidiary after the merger, the
     appointment of A. Eugene Sapp, Jr., Wayne Shortridge and Jackie M. Ward to
     Sanmina's board of directors and the indemnification of directors and
     officers of SCI, as provided in the merger agreement, against certain
     liabilities both before and after the merger.

     In addition, Sanmina director Joseph M. Schell serves as chairman of global
     technology investment banking of Merrill Lynch & Co. Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
     Fenner & Smith Incorporated, the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch & Co.,
     served as Sanmina's financial advisor on the merger. Mr. Schell abstained
     from voting on proposals related to the merger.

Q:   DID SANMINA'S AND SCI'S FINANCIAL ADVISORS RENDER OPINIONS CONCERNING THE
     FAIRNESS OF THE EXCHANGE RATIO FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW? (SEE PAGES
     49-63)

A.   Yes.

     In connection with the merger:

     - Sanmina's board of directors considered the opinion it received from
       Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as to the fairness,
       from a financial point of view, on the date of such opinion, to Sanmina
       of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement; and

     - SCI's board of directors considered the opinion it received from Goldman,
       Sachs & Co. that, as of the date of such opinion, the exchange ratio
       pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view
       to the holders of SCI common stock.

     The full text of the written opinions of Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs
     dated July 13, 2001, which set forth assumptions made, matters considered
     and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinions,
     are contained in Annex B and Annex C, respectively. Merrill Lynch and
     Goldman Sachs provided their respective opinions for the information and
     assistance of the board of directors of Sanmina and SCI, respectively, in
     connection with its consideration of the merger. Neither the Merrill Lynch
     opinion nor the Goldman Sachs opinion is a recommendation as to how any
     stockholder should vote with respect to the transaction. We urge you to
     read the opinions in their entirety.

                           STEPS FOR YOU TO TAKE NOW

Q:   WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW? (SEE PAGES 36-41)

A.   After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
     joint proxy statement/ prospectus, please vote your shares by:

     - mailing your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope; or

     - granting a proxy by telephone or on the Internet.

     IF YOU DO NOT INCLUDE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO VOTE YOUR PROPERLY SIGNED
     PROXY CARD, YOUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE VOTED "FOR" APPROVAL OF MATTERS
     RELATED TO THE MERGER.

     YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT YOU OWN.

Q:   WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE VOTES TAKE PLACE? (SEE PAGES 36-41)

A.   Special meeting of Sanmina stockholders.  The Sanmina special meeting will
     be held at [               ] at [               ] on [               ],
     2001, starting at [          ], local time.

     Special meeting of SCI stockholders.  The SCI special meeting will be held
     at [               ] on [               ], 2001, starting at [          ],
     local time.

Q:   SHOULD I SEND IN MY SCI STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW? (SEE PAGE 65)

A.   No. After the merger is completed, Sanmina will send you written
     instructions for exchanging your SCI stock certificates for Sanmina stock
     certificates.

Q:   IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY
     SHARES FOR ME? (SEE PAGES 37 AND 40)

A.   No. Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on
     how to vote by following the instructions provided to you by your broker.

Q:   WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO CHANGE MY VOTE? (SEE PAGES 38 AND 41)

A.   You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your
     special meeting. There are several ways for you to do this:

     - send written notice to the secretary of Sanmina or SCI (as appropriate)
       that you wish to revoke your proxy;

     - send a completed proxy card bearing a date later than your original proxy
       card prior to the vote at the special meeting;

     - grant a new telephone or Internet proxy prior to the vote at the special
       meeting; or

     - attend the meeting and vote in person.

Q:   WHAT HAPPENS IF AN SCI STOCKHOLDER DOES NOT VOTE? (SEE PAGE 40)

A.   If an SCI stockholder fails to grant a proxy or vote at the special
     meeting, it will have the same effect as a vote against approval and
     adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. If you return
     your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be
     counted as a vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and approve the
     merger.

     If you submit a proxy and affirmatively elect to abstain from voting, your
     proxy will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the
     presence of a quorum but will not be voted at the special meeting.
     Consequently, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote against
     approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger.

Q:   WHAT HAPPENS IF A SANMINA STOCKHOLDER DOES NOT VOTE? (SEE PAGE 37)

A.   If a Sanmina stockholder does not grant a proxy or vote at the special
     meeting on the issuance of Sanmina common stock to SCI stockholders in
     connection with the merger, the shares will not be counted as present for
     purposes of determining the presence of absence of a quorum and will have
     no effect on the outcome of the proposal. If a Sanmina stockholder fails to
     grant a proxy or vote at the special meeting on the change of Sanmina's
     corporate name to [          ], it will have the same effect as a vote
     against the proposal.

     If you submit a proxy card and do not indicate how you want to vote, your
     proxy will be counted as a vote to approve these proposals.

     If you grant a proxy and affirmatively elect to abstain from voting, your
     shares will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the
     presence of a quorum but will not be voted at the special meeting.
     Consequently, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote against
     the issuance of Sanmina common stock and the change of Sanmina's corporate
     name.

Q:   AM I ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE
     MERGER? (SEE PAGE 68)

A.   No. Under Delaware law, stockholders of SCI are not entitled to dissenters'
     or appraisal rights in connection with the merger. Similarly, under
     Delaware law, stockholders of Sanmina are not entitled to dissenters' or
     appraisal rights in connection with the issuance of Sanmina common stock to
     SCI stockholders.

                           OTHER MATTERS TO CONSIDER

Q:   HOW DO THE MARKET PRICES OF SANMINA AND SCI COMMON STOCK COMPARE? (SEE PAGE
     18)

A.   Shares of Sanmina common stock are listed on the Nasdaq National Market
     System and shares of SCI are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
     Sanmina's trading symbol is "SANM" and SCI's trading symbol is "SCI." On
     July 13, 2001, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement
     of the proposed merger, the last reported sale prices were:

     - $22.14 per share of Sanmina common stock, and

     - $25.17 per share of SCI common stock.

     On [  ], 2001 the last reported sale prices were:

     - $[  ] per share of Sanmina common stock, and

     - $[  ] per share of SCI common stock.

     Sanmina and SCI urge you to obtain current market quotations.

Q:   WHAT ARE THE EXPECTED UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
     MERGER? (SEE PAGES 65-66)

A.   Sanmina and SCI each expect the merger to qualify as a reorganization for
     U.S. federal income tax purposes. SCI stockholders will not recognize gain
     or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes by exchanging their SCI shares
     for shares of Sanmina common stock. However, SCI stockholders will
     recognize gain or loss with respect to cash received in lieu of a
     fractional share of Sanmina common stock.

     A DESCRIPTION OF THE MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
     MERGER IS SET FORTH IN "THE MERGER -- MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME
     TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER." THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO EACH SCI
     STOCKHOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF THAT STOCKHOLDER'S OWN SITUATION.
     THEREFORE, SCI STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO
     DETERMINE THEIR PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES.

Q:   HOW WILL THE MERGER BE ACCOUNTED FOR? (SEE PAGE 66)

A.   The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination in
     accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
     States. Accordingly, the cost to acquire SCI will be allocated to the
     tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
     assumed based on their fair values, with any excess being treated as
     goodwill. Goodwill under the recently issued Statements of Financial
     Accounting Standards Nos. 141 and 142 "Business Combinations" and "Goodwill
     and Other Intangibles" will no longer be subject to periodic amortization,
     but rather goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for
     impairment applying a fair-value based test. Identified intangible assets
     with finite lives will be amortized over those lives.

Q.   WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT MUST BE SATISFIED FOR THE MERGER TO OCCUR?
     (SEE PAGES 75-76)

A.   Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a
     number of conditions, including (but not limited to):

     - holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of SCI common stock must
       vote in favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and
       approval of the merger;

     - holders of a majority of the shares of Sanmina common stock present or
       represented by proxy at the special meeting must approve the share
       issuance and the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
       Sanmina common stock entitled to vote on the record date must approve the
       name change;

     - the registration statement, of which this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus is a part, must be declared and remain effective by
       the Securities and Exchange Commission;

     - no law, regulation or order preventing the completion of the merger shall
       be in effect;

     - the applicable waiting periods under antitrust laws must expire or be
       terminated;

     - each company must receive an opinion from its tax counsel that the merger
       will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
       the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;

     - the shares of Sanmina common stock to be issued in the merger must be
       approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market;

     - each company must not have breached any covenant, representation or
       warranty in a material manner;

     - SCI must have obtained all consents, waivers and approvals required under
       the merger agreement; and

     - neither Sanmina nor SCI shall have had a Material Adverse Effect (as
       defined on p. 76 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus) since July 13,
       2001.

Q:   DOES THE MERGER AGREEMENT PERMIT TERMINATION OF THE MERGER? (SEE PAGES
     76-77)

A.   Yes. Sanmina and SCI may mutually agree to terminate the merger agreement
     without completing the merger. Additionally, either SCI or Sanmina may
     terminate the merger agreement under any of the following circumstances:

     - if the merger is not completed by December 31, 2001;

     - if a final court order prohibiting the merger is issued and is not
       appealable;

     - if the Sanmina stockholders do not approve the share issuance and the
       name change;

     - if the SCI stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement and
       approve the merger; or

     - if the conditions to completion of the merger would not be satisfied
       because of a breach of a representation or warranty in the merger
       agreement resulting in a Material Adverse Effect or a failure to comply
       in all material respects with a covenant or agreement in the merger
       agreement.

     Sanmina may terminate the merger agreement if:

     - SCI's board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies in a manner
       adverse to Sanmina, its recommendation in favor of the merger;

     - SCI's board of directors fails to include its recommendation in favor of
       the merger agreement and merger in any proxy statement or prospectus to
       be sent to SCI stockholders;

     - SCI's board of directors recommends any acquisition proposal from a party
       other than Sanmina or enters into a definitive agreement for an
       acquisition transaction with a party other than Sanmina, or resolves to
       take any such action;

     - SCI breaches its agreement not to solicit alternative proposals for a
       business combination with SCI; or

     - SCI's board of directors fails to send its stockholders a recommendation
       to reject any tender or exchange offer by a third party within 10 days of
       commencement of the offer.

     SCI may terminate the merger agreement if it executes a definitive
     agreement relating to an Acquisition Transaction (as defined on p. 73 of
     this joint proxy statement/prospectus).

Q:   COULD PAYMENT OF A TERMINATION FEE BE REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
     MERGER? (SEE PAGES 77-78)

A.   Yes. If the merger agreement is terminated upon some specified occurrences,
     SCI may be required to pay to Sanmina a termination fee of up to $150.0
     million. In addition, either party may be required to pay the other a fee
     of $3.0 million if the matters in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are
     not approved by that party's stockholders and the merger does not occur as
     a result.

Q:   MAY SCI NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER PARTIES? (SEE PAGES 72-74)

A.   No. SCI agreed, subject to limited exceptions for responses to unsolicited
     bona fide offers, not to initiate or engage in discussions with another
     party concerning a business combination with a party other than Sanmina
     while the merger is pending.

     Nothing in the merger agreement prevents the SCI board of directors from
     withdrawing or changing its recommendation in favor of the merger if, as a
     result of a Superior Offer (as defined on page 74 of this joint proxy
     statement/prospectus) from a third party, the board reasonably concludes in
     good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure
     to so withdraw or change its recommendation would result in a reasonable
     likelihood that the SCI board of directors would not fulfill its fiduciary
     duties to SCI's stockholders under Delaware law.

Q:   ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL SANMINA STOCK RECEIVED AS A
     RESULT OF THE MERGER? (SEE PAGE 67)

A.   All Sanmina common stock received by SCI stockholders in connection with
     the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is considered an
     affiliate of either Sanmina or SCI under the Securities Act of 1933, as
     amended. Shares of Sanmina received by affiliates of SCI in the merger may
     only be resold in compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

     Generally, an affiliate is considered to be someone who is an executive
     officer or director of a company or someone who owns more than 10% of the
     outstanding stock of a company.

                           FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

     You should not rely on forward looking statements in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. This joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus contain
forward looking statements within the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to Sanmina's and SCI's
financial conditions, operating results and businesses and on the expected
impact of the merger on Sanmina's financial performance. We use words such as
"anticipates," "believes," "plans," "expects," "future," "intends," "may,"
"will," "should," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "continue" and similar
expressions to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contemplated by the forward looking statements.

     Some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contemplated by such forward looking statements include, but are not
limited to, the following possibilities:

     - successfully integrating Sanmina's and SCI's operations, systems and
       personnel may be more difficult than we expect;

     - the combined company may not be able to retain and hire key executives,
       technical personnel and other employees;

     - the transaction may not close due to the failure to obtain required
       regulatory or stockholder approvals;

     - the combined company may not effectively manage its growth;

     - relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic partners may
       change to the combined company's disadvantage;

     - the combined company's operating costs may be higher than anticipated;

     - general economic conditions or conditions in securities markets may be
       less favorable than we currently anticipate; and

     - costs related to the merger may be more than we currently anticipate.

     Some of these factors and additional risks and uncertainties are further
discussed under the other factors identified in the "Risk Factors" section
beginning on page 20. Because such statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or
implied by such statements. Sanmina and SCI stockholders are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus or the date of any document incorporated by
reference.

         SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA

     We are providing the following summary unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial data to give you a picture of what the results of operations
and financial position of the combined businesses of Sanmina and SCI might have
looked like had the merger occurred at an earlier date. These statements give
effect to the merger accounted for as a purchase business combination. This
information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not show what
the results of operations or financial position of Sanmina would have been if
the merger actually occurred on the dates assumed. In addition, this information
is not an indicator of what Sanmina's future consolidated operating results or
consolidated financial position will be.

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial data are presented for
illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the combined
financial position or results of operations of future periods or the results
that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity
during these periods. The unaudited pro forma combined financial data are
derived from the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and should be read
in conjunction with those statements and related notes. See "UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS."

THESE PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS

     We prepared these pro forma statements on the basis of assumptions
described in the notes to them. The pro forma adjustments made in connection
with the development of the pro forma information are preliminary and have been
made solely for purposes of developing such pro forma information for
illustrative purposes necessary to comply with the disclosure requirements of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited pro forma combined
financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the results of
operations for future periods or the combined financial position or the results
that actually would have been realized had the entities been a single entity
during these periods.

COSTS RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION

     Sanmina and SCI estimate that they will incur direct transaction costs of
approximately $18.5 million and $26.8 million, respectively, associated with the
merger. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet and the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations give effect to
such costs of Sanmina, which will be included as part of the purchase cost, as
if they had been incurred as of June 30, 2001 and October 1, 2000, respectively.
Such charges of SCI, which will be expensed, will be reflected in SCI's
consolidated financial statements in the period in which the merger is
consummated.

YOU SHOULD READ THESE SUMMARY PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH THE HISTORICAL
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The Sanmina summary unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data
should be read in conjunction with the Sanmina unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements and the related notes, which begin on page 85.
They should also be read in conjunction with the historical audited and
unaudited financial statements of Sanmina and SCI which are incorporated by
reference in this document. The Sanmina summary unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial data are not necessarily indicative of what the actual
results of operations and financial position would have been had the merger
taken place on the dates indicated, and do not indicate future results of
operations or financial position.

(1) The historical basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income
    for each respective period by the number of weighted average common shares
    outstanding during the respective time period. The historical diluted net
    income per share is computed by dividing net income after adding back
    interest expense, net of related income tax effect, associated with
    convertible subordinated debt from each respective period by the common
    equivalent shares outstanding during the respective time period assuming the
    conversion of convertible subordinated debt, unless antidilutive.
(2) The historical book value per share is computed by dividing total
    stockholders' equity at the end of each respective period by the number of
    common shares outstanding at the end of each respective period.

(1) The unaudited pro forma combined basic and diluted net income per Sanmina
    common share data are based upon the unaudited pro forma combined net income
    divided by the unaudited pro forma combined, weighted average number of
    common and common equivalent shares outstanding of Sanmina and SCI of each
    respective period at an assumed exchange ratio of 1.36 shares of Sanmina
    common stock for each share of SCI common stock. The unaudited pro forma
    combined net income for the nine months ended June 30, 2001 combines
    Sanmina's nine months ended June 30, 2001 with SCI's nine months ended March
    25, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined net income for the year ended
    September 30, 2000 combines Sanmina's fiscal year end of September 30, 2000
    with SCI's fiscal year end of June 30, 2000, respectively. The unaudited pro
    forma combined and equivalent pro forma combined data do not present like
    periods. The use of different closing dates is necessary as each entity has
    different year ends. The pro forma reporting with respect to combining
    Sanmina and SCI's annual period results with different fiscal year ends that
    are within 93 days is in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
    guidance.
(2) The unaudited pro forma combined book value per Sanmina share is computed by
    dividing the unaudited pro forma combined stockholders' equity at the end of
    each respective period by the number of pro forma combined common shares
    outstanding at the end of the period, at an assumed exchange ratio of 1.36
    shares of Sanmina common stock for each share of SCI common stock.
(3) The unaudited equivalent pro forma combined basic and diluted net income per
    SCI share amounts and the unaudited equivalent pro forma book value per SCI
    share amount are calculated by multiplying the respective unaudited pro
    forma combined Sanmina per share amounts by an assumed exchange ratio of
    1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock for each share of SCI common stock.

                    COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE DATA

     Sanmina common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "SANM." SCI common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol "SCI." Because the market price of Sanmina common stock that you will
receive in the merger may increase or decrease before the merger, you are urged
to obtain current market quotations.

     The following table sets forth, for the quarters indicated, the intraday
high and low prices per share of Sanmina common stock as reported on the Nasdaq
National Market and SCI common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sanmina common stock began trading on the Nasdaq National Market on June 23,

                                DIVIDEND POLICY

     Neither Sanmina nor SCI has paid cash dividends on their common stock.
SCI's bank agreements restrict its ability to pay dividends by requiring it to
maintain a certain consolidated net worth which required amount at June 30, 2000
was $1,027,200,000. After the merger is completed, Sanmina does not anticipate
paying any cash dividends.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In evaluating the merger, you should carefully consider the discussion of
risks and uncertainties below and you should refer to the matters discussed
under the caption "Forward Looking Statements" in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus on page 11.

     By voting in favor of the merger, SCI stockholders will be choosing to
invest in Sanmina common stock. An investment in Sanmina common stock involves a
high degree of risk. By voting in favor of the share issuance in connection with
the merger, current Sanmina stockholders will face dilution of their ownership
interest in Sanmina. In addition to the other information contained in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider all of the
following risk factors relating to the proposed merger, the combined company,
Sanmina and SCI in deciding whether to vote for the merger.

                          RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

SANMINA FACES UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE INTEGRATION OF SANMINA'S AND SCI'S
OPERATIONS, SYSTEMS AND PERSONNEL.

     Integrating the operations, systems and personnel of Sanmina and SCI will
be a complex process, and Sanmina and SCI are uncertain that the integration
will be completed in a timely manner or will achieve the anticipated benefits of
the merger. The challenges involved in this integration include:

     - retaining existing customers, suppliers and other business partners of
       each company;

     - retaining and integrating management and other key employees of both
       Sanmina and SCI;

     - combining product and service offerings effectively, quickly and without
       disruption to Sanmina's or SCI's ongoing businesses;

     - transitioning all systems to a common information technology system;

     - persuading employees that the business cultures of Sanmina and SCI are
       compatible; and

     - developing, maintaining and combining uniform standards, controls,
       procedures and policies.

     The combined company may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other
problems encountered in connection with the merger. The diversion of the
attention of Sanmina's and SCI's management and any difficulties encountered in
the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of, or a loss
of momentum in, the activities of Sanmina's and SCI's businesses. In addition,
there may be unanticipated expenses related to integration of the two companies.
Further, neither Sanmina nor SCI can assure you that the growth rate of the
combined company will equal the historical growth rates experienced by either
company.

THE VALUE OF THE SANMINA COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED BY SCI STOCKHOLDERS WILL
FLUCTUATE WITH SANMINA'S SHARE PRICE, AND NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE EXCHANGE RATIO
WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE MARKET PRICE OF SANMINA OR SCI COMMON
STOCK.

     At the closing of the merger, each share of SCI common stock will be
exchanged for 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock. This exchange ratio will not
be adjusted for changes in the market price of Sanmina common stock or SCI
common stock. SCI stockholders will not know the exact market value of Sanmina's
common stock which will be issued to them in the merger at the time of the
special meeting of SCI stockholders. Neither Sanmina nor SCI may terminate or
renegotiate the merger agreement, and SCI may not resolicit the vote of its
stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of Sanmina common
stock or SCI common stock. If Sanmina's common stock price declines prior to or
on the closing of the merger, the Sanmina common stock received by SCI
stockholders at the closing will have a market value less than the current
market value of Sanmina common stock.

     The market price of Sanmina's common stock, like that of the shares of many
other technology companies, has been and is expected to continue to be volatile.
For example, during the twelve months ended on August 9, 2001, Sanmina common
stock traded as high as $60.50 per share and as low as $17.53 per share. The
market price of Sanmina common stock is expected to continue to fluctuate
significantly.

CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE MERGER COULD HARM THE COMBINED
COMPANY.

     Sanmina's and SCI's customers may, in response to the announcement or
consummation of the merger, seek alternative sources of product supply or
service, or change orders for products due to uncertainty over the integration
of the two companies or the strategic position of the combined company. As a
result, the combined company may experience some customer attrition prior to or
following the merger which could harm the combined company's results of
operations. In addition, employees of both companies may experience uncertainty
about their future roles with the combined company until or after Sanmina
announces and executes its integration plan with regard to employees. This may
adversely affect the combined company's ability to attract and retain key
management, marketing and technical personnel.

IF SANMINA DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE SCI OR THE MERGER'S BENEFITS DO NOT
MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF INVESTORS OR FINANCIAL OR INDUSTRY ANALYSTS, THE MARKET
PRICE OF SANMINA COMMON STOCK MAY DECLINE AFTER THE MERGER.

     The market price of Sanmina common stock may decline as a result of the
merger if:

     - the integration of Sanmina and SCI is not completed in a timely and
       efficient manner;

     - the perceived benefits of the merger are not achieved as rapidly or to
       the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;

     - the effect of the merger on the combined company's financial results is
       not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts;
       or

     - significant stockholders of Sanmina decide to dispose of their shares
       after the merger because the results of the merger are not consistent
       with their expectations.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE MARKET PRICE OF
SANMINA COMMON STOCK AND SCI COMMON STOCK.

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, Sanmina and SCI will be
subject to a number of material risks, including:

     - the provision in the merger agreement which provides that SCI could be
       required to pay Sanmina fees aggregating up to $150.0 million for
       terminating the merger agreement, entering into a merger agreement with
       another company or consummating a business combination transaction with
       another company within 15 months after termination of the merger
       agreement;

     - the market prices of Sanmina common stock and SCI common stock may
       decline to the extent that the current market price of those shares
       reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed;

     - significant costs related to the merger, such as filing fees, printing
       costs, legal and accounting fees and a portion of the investment banking
       fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed; and

     - benefits that Sanmina and SCI expect to realize from the merger, such as
       the potentially enhanced competitive position of the combined company,
       may not be realized.

     If the merger agreement is terminated and the SCI board of directors seeks
another merger or business combination, SCI stockholders cannot be certain that
SCI will be able to find another party willing to pay an equivalent or more
attractive price than the price to be paid by Sanmina in the merger.

THE MERGER WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO SANMINA AND SCI.

     Costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies are
difficult to estimate. Direct transaction costs to Sanmina, which will be
included as part of the total purchase price for accounting purposes, are
estimated at approximately $18.5 million. Direct transaction costs of SCI, which
will be expensed in the quarter that the merger closes, are estimated at
approximately $26.8 million. These costs are expected to consist primarily of
fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, filing fees and financial
printing. The aggregate amount of these costs may be greater than currently
anticipated. A substantial amount of these costs will be incurred whether or not
the merger is completed. Sanmina believes the combined company may incur charges
to operations, which are not currently reasonably estimable, in the quarter in
which the merger is completed or the following quarters, to reflect costs
associated with integrating the businesses and operations of Sanmina and SCI.
There can be no assurance that the combined company will not incur additional
material charges in subsequent quarters to reflect additional costs associated
with the merger.

PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND THE IMPACT OF
AMORTIZATION OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SANMINA'S
OPERATING RESULTS.

     Under United States generally accepted accounting principles that apply to
Sanmina, Sanmina will account for the merger as a purchase business combination.
Sanmina will record the following as the cost of acquiring SCI:

     - the market value of Sanmina common stock issued in connection with the
       merger;

     - the fair value of the options to purchase SCI common stock that will be
       converted into options to purchase Sanmina common stock in connection
       with the merger; and

     - the amount of direct transaction costs incurred by Sanmina.

     Sanmina will allocate the cost of the items described above to the
individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including deferred
compensation and identifiable intangible assets such as technology-based
intangible assets, based on their respective fair values. Identifiable
intangible assets with finite lives will be amortized over those lives.
Intangible assets, including goodwill, with indefinite lives will not be
amortized. The amount of purchase cost allocated to goodwill and identifiable
intangibles are estimated to be approximately $3.2 billion and $0.4 million,
respectively, computed using the estimated purchase price of $4.4 billion which
is based on the average closing price of Sanmina's common stock during the five
trading day period ended July 17, 2001, or $20.87 per share. Identified
intangible assets will be amortized over estimated lives of five to eight years,
or six years on average. Deferred compensation will be amortized over the
remaining vesting period of SCI's outstanding stock options of up to four years.
The amount of purchase cost allocated to deferred compensation is estimated at
$6.6 million. If identifiable intangible assets were amortized in equal
quarterly amounts over a six year period following the completion of the merger,
and deferred compensation were amortized in equal quarterly amounts over the
average remaining vesting period of the related stock options, the accounting
charge attributable to these items would be approximately $17.2 million per
quarter and $68.9 million per fiscal year in the year following the closing date
of the merger. As a result, business combination accounting treatment of the
merger will decrease the net income of Sanmina in the foreseeable future, which
could have a material adverse effect on the market value of Sanmina common stock
following the completion of the merger. These amounts are only estimates,
however, and actual amounts may differ from these estimates.

DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE MERGER, SCI MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO A MERGER OR
BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH ANOTHER PARTY AT A FAVORABLE PRICE BECAUSE OF
RESTRICTIONS IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
subject to specified exceptions, SCI is prohibited from entering into or
soliciting, initiating or encouraging any inquiries or proposals that may lead
to a proposal or offer for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale
of substantial assets, tender offer, sale of shares of capital stock or other
similar transactions regarding SCI as a whole with any person or

entity other than Sanmina. In addition, SCI agreed to pay a termination fee of
up to $150.0 million in specified circumstances. These provisions could
discourage other companies from seeking to acquire SCI even though those other
companies might be willing to offer greater value to SCI stockholders than
Sanmina has offered in the merger. The payment of the termination fee could also
have a material adverse effect on SCI's financial condition.

NEED FOR GOVERNMENTAL CLEARANCES MAY DELAY CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER.

     This merger is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the European Union Council Regulation No.
4064/89 and the Competition Act of Canada. Sanmina and SCI also have filed a
premerger notification form with the antitrust agency in Brazil. In addition,
other filings with, notifications to, and authorizations and approvals of, the
antitrust agency in Mexico, and possibly antitrust agencies in other
jurisdictions, may be required to be made and received prior to consummation of
the merger. Sanmina and SCI are seeking to obtain all required regulatory
clearances prior to the scheduled completion of these transactions. However, all
required regulatory clearances may not be obtained on that timetable.
Restrictions on the combined operations of, or divestitures by, the two
companies may be sought by governmental agencies as a condition to obtaining
these clearances. Notwithstanding any agreements regarding operating
restrictions or divestitures that may be required under applicable U.S. or
non-U.S. law or by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities, neither Sanmina nor SCI is
required to agree under the terms of the merger agreement, to any divestiture of
capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Sanmina, SCI or their
subsidiaries or affiliates, or the imposition of any material limitation on the
ability of any of these parties to conduct their businesses or to own or
exercise control of assets, property or stock.

     The combined company may be required to agree to various operating
restrictions, before or after receipt of stockholder approval, in order to
obtain the necessary approvals of the merger under U.S. or non-U.S. antitrust
laws, or to assure that non-U.S. governmental authorities do not seek to block
the merger. No additional stockholder approval is expected to be required or
sought for any decision by Sanmina or SCI after the special meetings of
Sanmina's and SCI's stockholders to agree to any terms and conditions necessary
to resolve any regulatory objections to the merger, and stockholder approval
will not be sought unless such stockholder approval is required to approve the
terms and conditions under applicable law.

     Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, any federal, state or non-U.S.
governmental entity or any private person may challenge the merger at any time
before or after its completion.

SCI EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE INTERESTS THAT MAY INFLUENCE THEM TO
SUPPORT AND APPROVE THE MERGER.

     Some of the directors and executive officers of SCI will receive continuing
indemnification against liabilities and have SCI stock options and employment
offers that provide them with interests in the merger that are different from,
or are in addition to, your interests in the merger. For example, A. Eugene
Sapp, Jr., SCI's chief executive officer and an SCI director, has entered into
an employment agreement with SCI and Sanmina, and James E. Moylan, Jr., SCI's
senior vice president and chief financial officer, intends to enter into an
employment agreement with Sanmina and SCI. Robert C. Bradshaw, SCI's president
and chief operating officer, also intends to enter into an employment agreement
with Sanmina. Further, Mr. Sapp, Wayne Shortridge and Jackie M. Ward, currently
directors of SCI, will become members of the board of directors of Sanmina upon
completion of the merger. As a result, these directors and officers may be more
likely to vote to adopt and approve the merger agreement and approve the merger
than if they did not have these interests. See the section entitled "THE
MERGER -- Interests of SCI Directors and Officers in the Merger" beginning on
page 63 of this document.

               RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMBINED COMPANY OPERATIONS

SANMINA AND SCI ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY IN GENERAL AND
THE COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR IN PARTICULAR, AND CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY COULD HARM
THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

     Sanmina's and SCI's businesses are heavily dependent on the health of the
electronics industry. Sanmina's customers are manufacturers in the
communications, industrial and medical instrumentation and high-speed computer
systems sectors of the electronics industry. SCI's customers are manufacturers
of electronics products in various sectors, including the computer, peripheral,
communications, medical, industrial, consumer, aerospace, defense and
entertainment sectors. These industry sectors, and the electronics industry as a
whole, are subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence.
Sanmina's and SCI's customers can discontinue or modify products containing
components manufactured by them. Any discontinuance or modification of orders or
commitments could harm Sanmina's and SCI's operating results.

     A substantial portion of Sanmina's revenues are derived from the
communications sector. SCI also has several significant customers in this
sector. During 2001, the communications sector has undergone a significant
downturn and many major communications companies have reported declining sales
and operating results. The downtown in this sector has resulted in rescheduling
of customer orders and shipments and has adversely affected Sanmina's, and to a
lesser extent, SCI's, operating results. In the event this downtown continues,
the combined company's operating results will continue to be harmed.

     The electronics industry is also subject to economic cycles and has in the
past experienced, and is likely in the future to experience, recessionary
periods. In particular, many sectors of the electronics industry are currently
experiencing the effects of a downturn in economic conditions. This downturn is
leading to reduced demand for the services provided by electronic manufacturing
services companies. These changes in demand and in economic conditions have
resulted and may continue to result in customer cancellation or rescheduling of
orders and shipments, which could affect the combined company's results of
operations. In addition, a protracted general recession in the electronics
industry could have a material adverse effect on the combined company's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

     In addition, Sanmina and SCI have experienced, and the combined company may
continue to experience, the risk that customers will be unable or unwilling to
pay for products and services already provided to them. On June 13, 2001,
Sanmina filed a complaint against Metricom, Inc. in California state court. The
complaint arose out of a July 2, 1999 agreement for electronic manufacturing
services and seeks compensation for cancellation charges arising under this
agreement. Sanmina's damages consist of the cost of certain materials and
work-in-process. Metricom has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and, as a result,
Sanmina's claim has been stayed. Accordingly, Sanmina has filed a claim for its
damages in the bankruptcy proceedings. Based on Sanmina's reserves allocated for
the Metricom situation as well as current estimates of funds that will be
available to satisfy claims of trade creditors in the Metricom bankruptcy
proceeding, Sanmina currently estimates its potential exposure on this matter
will not exceed $10 million (after exhausting reserves). The actual amount of
exposure will depend on actions taken by the bankruptcy court, and the amount
realized from Metricom's assets in the bankruptcy proceeding that are available
to be distributed to unsecured creditors. Accordingly, Sanmina's actual exposure
in this matter could be in excess of the estimated amount.

SANMINA AND SCI TYPICALLY DO NOT OBTAIN LONG-TERM VOLUME PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
FROM CUSTOMERS, AND CANCELLATIONS AND RESCHEDULING OF PURCHASE ORDERS COULD HARM
THE COMBINED COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND CAUSE THE COMBINED COMPANY'S STOCK
PRICE TO DECLINE.

     Sanmina and SCI typically do not obtain long-term volume purchase
commitments from their customers. Customer orders may be canceled and volume
levels may be changed or delayed. For example, Sanmina and SCI have recently
experienced certain cancellation and rescheduling of shipment dates of customer
orders. As a result, Sanmina's and SCI's results of operations for the second
calendar quarter of 2001 were adversely affected. Results of operations in
future fiscal periods may continue to be affected by customer cancellations

and reschedulings as well as by changes in shipment volumes. Sanmina and SCI
cannot assure you that they will be able to replace canceled, delayed or reduced
contracts or purchase orders with new business. As a result, future
cancellations or rescheduling of orders or commitments could cause the combined
company's operating results to be below expectations, which would likely cause
the combined company's stock price to decline.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY, WHICH MAY
CAUSE ITS STOCK PRICE TO FALL.

     Sanmina's and SCI's quarterly and annual results of operations have varied
in the past, and the combined company's operating results may vary significantly
in the future due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the
following:

     - timing of orders from major customers;

     - mix of products ordered by and shipped to major customers;

     - the volume of orders as related to each company's capacity;

     - pricing and other competitive pressures;

     - component shortages, which could cause the combined company to be unable
       to meet customer delivery schedules;

     - fluctuations in component prices;

     - economic conditions in the electronics industry;

     - the combined company's ability to effectively manage inventory and fixed
       assets; and

     - the combined company's ability to time expenditures in anticipation of
       future sales.

     The combined company's results can also be significantly influenced by the
development and introduction of new products by its customers. From time to
time, Sanmina and SCI experience changes in the volume of sales to each of their
principal customers, and operating results may be affected on a period-to-period
basis by these changes. Sanmina's and SCI's customers generally require short
delivery cycles, and a substantial portion of each of their backlogs are
typically scheduled for delivery within six months. Quarterly sales and
operating results therefore depend in large part on the volume and timing of
bookings received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast.

     Sanmina's and SCI's backlogs also affect their ability to plan production
and inventory levels, which could lead to fluctuations in operating results. In
addition, a significant portion of Sanmina's and SCI's operating expenses are
relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on
anticipated orders. Any inability to adjust spending quickly enough to
compensate for any revenue shortfall may magnify the adverse impact of such
revenue shortfall on Sanmina's and SCI's results of operations. Results of
operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to
be expected for the combined company in any future period. In addition,
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price
of the combined company's common stock.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL RELY ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR A
SUBSTANTIAL PART OF ITS REVENUES, AND DECLINES IN SALES TO MAJOR CUSTOMERS COULD
HARM THE COMBINED COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS.

     Sales to a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant
portion of each of Sanmina's and SCI's revenues in each fiscal period. Sanmina
and SCI expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to
account for a substantial portion of the combined company's total revenues in
future periods. Sanmina and SCI each has experienced periods in which sales to
some of their respective major customers, as a percentage of total revenues,
have fluctuated due to delays or failures to place expected orders.

     During fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, sales to Sanmina's ten largest customers
accounted for approximately 55%, 48% and 40%, respectively, of Sanmina's net
sales. For fiscal 2000, only sales to one customer, Nortel

Networks, represented more than 10% of Sanmina's net sales. For fiscal 1999 and
1998, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. This customer
information gives effect to the restatement of Sanmina's results of operations
to reflect its recent acquisition of AB Segerstrom and Svensson.

     During fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, SCI's ten largest customers contributed
more than 75% of SCI's revenues. For fiscal 2000, sales to Hewlett-Packard
Company and Nortel Networks Corporation each represented more than 10% of SCI's
revenues. For fiscal 1999, sales to Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Compaq each
represented more than 10% of SCI's revenues and for fiscal 1998, sales to
Hewlett-Packard represented more than 10% of SCI's revenues.

     Although Sanmina and SCI cannot assure you that the combined company's
principal customers will continue to purchase products and services at current
levels, if at all, Sanmina and SCI expect that the combined company will
continue to depend upon its principal customers for a significant portion of
their net sales. The combined company's customer concentration could increase or
decrease, depending on future customer requirements, which will depend in large
part on market conditions in the electronics industry segments in which the
combined company's customers participate. The loss of one or more major
customers or declines in sales to major customers could significantly harm the
combined company's business and operating results and lead to declines in the
price of the combined company's common stock.

SANMINA AND SCI ARE EACH SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS, AND
THESE RISKS COULD HARM THE COMBINED COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND CAUSE ITS
STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.

     Sanmina and SCI each have, for the past several fiscal years, pursued a
strategy of growth through acquisitions. In Sanmina's case, these acquisitions
have primarily involved acquisitions of entire companies. In addition, Sanmina
and SCI have acquired selected assets from electronics industry OEMs,
principally equipment, inventory and in certain cases facilities or facility
leases. These transactions also typically involve new supply agreements with
OEMs. Acquisitions of companies and businesses and expansion of operations
involve certain risks, including the following:

     - the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and
       businesses or to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or
       other value;

     - diversion of management's attention;

     - difficulties in scaling up production at new sites and coordinating
       management of operations at new sites;

     - difficulties associated with managing and integrating operations in
       distant geographic locations, such as Europe, the Middle East, Asia and
       Latin America;

     - the possible need to restructure, modify or terminate customer
       relationships of the acquired company; and

     - loss of key employees of acquired operations.

     Accordingly, the combined company may experience problems in integrating
operations recently acquired by Sanmina or SCI or operations associated with any
future acquisition. Sanmina and SCI therefore cannot assure you that any recent
or future acquisition will result in a positive contribution to the combined
company's results of operations. Furthermore, Sanmina and SCI cannot assure you
that the combined company will realize value from any acquisition which equals
or exceeds the consideration paid. In particular, the successful combination of
the combined company with any businesses the combined company acquires in the
future will require substantial effort from each company, including the
integration and coordination of sales and marketing efforts. The diversion of
the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition
process, including, the interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the
activities of any future acquisition, problems associated with integration of
management information and reporting systems, and delays in implementation of
consolidation plans, could harm the combined company's ability to realize the
anticipated benefits of any future acquisition. Any failure by the combined
company to realize the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions could harm its
business and operating results, and could cause the price of the

combined company's common stock to decline. In addition, future acquisitions may
result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of additional
debt, large one-time write-offs and the creation of goodwill or other intangible
assets that could result in amortization expense or impairment charges. These
factors could harm the combined company's business and operating results and
cause the price of the combined company's common stock to decline.

OEM ASSET DIVESTITURE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS THAT COULD HARM THE
COMBINED COMPANY.

     Sanmina and SCI have pursued and both companies expect to continue to
pursue opportunities to acquire assembly operations being divested by
electronics industry OEMs. Sanmina and SCI expect that competition for these
opportunities among electronics manufacturing services firms will be intense as
these transactions typically enable the acquiror to enter into long-term supply
arrangements with the divesting OEM. Accordingly, the combined company's future
results of operations could be harmed if it is not successful in consummating a
significant portion of the OEM divestiture transactions it pursues. In addition,
due to the large scale and long-term nature of supply arrangements typically
entered into in OEM divestiture transactions and because cost reductions are
generally a major reason why the OEM is divesting operations, pricing of
manufacturing services may be less favorable to the manufacturer than in
standard contractual relationships. For example, Sanmina experienced declines in
gross margins during fiscal 2000 due to Sanmina's increase in sales to Nortel
Networks under Sanmina's supply agreement relating to the operations it
acquired. In addition, premiums paid to the divesting OEM may be in excess of
the value that can be realized from the transaction. Furthermore, because these
transactions involve customers, they can present difficult managerial and
organizational challenges, particularly with respect to excess inventory, excess
capacity and similar problems. If the combined company enters into OEM
divestiture transactions, it may experience erosion in gross margins as a result
of the pricing structure in such transactions as well as problems arising from
excess inventory and capacity.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE COMPONENT SHORTAGES, WHICH WOULD CAUSE IT TO
DELAY SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, RESULTING IN POTENTIAL DECLINES IN REVENUES AND
OPERATING RESULTS.

     Recently, a number of components purchased by each of Sanmina and SCI and
incorporated into assemblies and subassemblies they each produce have been
subject to shortages. These components include application-specific integrated
circuits, capacitors and connectors. Unanticipated component shortages caused
Sanmina to be unable to make certain scheduled shipments to customers during
fiscal 2000 and may do so in the future. SCI also has experienced shipment
delays due to component shortages. The inability to make scheduled shipments in
the future could cause the combined company to experience a shortfall in
revenues and cost absorption. The combined company could also experience
negative customer goodwill due to the delay in shipment. Component shortages may
also increase the combined company's cost of goods due to premium charges it
must pay to purchase components in short supply and due to changes in the mix of
assemblies shipped to customers. For example, shortages in certain components
negatively affected Sanmina's and SCI's operating results and contributed to an
increase in inventory levels during fiscal 2001. Accordingly, component
shortages could harm the combined company's operating results for a particular
fiscal period due to the resulting revenue shortfall, cost absorption or cost
increases and could also damage customer relationships over a longer-term
period.

THE COMBINED COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITION AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND ITS
BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED BY COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND FAILURE TO ADAPT TO
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES.

     Because SCI and Sanmina operate to a considerable degree in different
markets, each of SCI and Sanmina will be affected differently by competition and
technological change. The combined company will be affected by competition and
technological change in the same manner as each company is affected, in addition
to facing new competitive and technological challenges as a result of the
merger.

     The electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive.
Sanmina and SCI compete on a worldwide basis to provide electronics
manufacturing services to OEM's. Sanmina and SCI must continually develop
improved manufacturing processes to accommodate customers' needs for
increasingly complex

products. Sanmina's and SCI's competitors include large independent
manufacturers such as Solectron Corporation, Flextronics International Ltd.,
Celestica, Inc. and Jabil Circuit, Inc. Some of these companies have greater
manufacturing and financial resources than Sanmina and SCI individually and as a
combined company. In addition, Sanmina and SCI face competition from OEMs that
manufacture their own products.

     The communications equipment industry is highly fragmented and
characterized by intense competition. Sanmina offers products and services in
the communications equipment product space, which is highly competitive but is
less fragmented than the electronics manufacturing services industry as a whole.
Sanmina's competitors also manufacture communications equipment products, and
some of these competitors have greater manufacturing and financial resources
than Sanmina, as well as greater surface mount assembly capacity. Consequently,
as a participant in the communications equipment product space, Sanmina must
continually develop improved manufacturing processes to accommodate Sanmina's
customers' needs for increasingly complex products. During periods of recession
in the electronics industry, Sanmina's competitive advantages in the areas of
quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced
importance to OEMs, who may become more price sensitive. Sanmina may also be at
a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers
with lower cost structures, particularly those with offshore facilities where
labor and other costs are lower.

     SCI competes against numerous domestic and international companies which
participate in the electronics manufacturing services industry. Additionally,
SCI faces competition from current and prospective customers who evaluate SCI's
services and capabilities against the merits of internal manufacturing.

     The combined company will experience intense competition which is expected
to intensify further as more companies enter markets in which the combined
company operates, as existing competitors expand capacity and as the industry
consolidates. To remain competitive, the combined company must develop and
provide technologically advanced engineering services, information systems and
manufacturing processes. In addition, the combined company must maintain high
quality products and services, offer flexible delivery schedules and deliver
products on a timely basis. Failure to satisfy these or other requirements could
adversely affect the combined company.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY.

     Although SCI's business historically has not been consistently seasonal,
seasonal demands for products produced by SCI for its customers and sold by them
to consumers may impact the combined company's quarterly revenues. The effect of
seasonality has increased in recent quarters, as the proportion of SCI's
customers' products ultimately sold at retail, has increased. SCI's operating
margins have undergone seasonal fluctuations in the past, particularly in the
first fiscal quarter due to the slowing effects of the summer season. Sanmina
and SCI believe these seasonality effects may continue at the combined company.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARE A KEY CONSIDERATION IN EACH OF SANMINA'S AND SCI'S
BUSINESS AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS COULD
HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     Both Sanmina and SCI are subject to a variety of local, state and federal
environmental laws in the United States and elsewhere and regulations relating
to the storage, use, discharge and disposal of chemicals, solid waste and other
hazardous materials used during their manufacturing processes, as well as air
quality regulations and restrictions on water use. Proper waste disposal is a
major consideration for printed circuit board manufacturers, such as Sanmina,
because metals and chemicals are used in the manufacturing process. Maintenance
of environmental controls is also important in the electronics assembly process.
When violations of environmental laws occur, Sanmina and SCI can be held liable
for damages and the costs of remedial actions and can also be subject to
revocation of permits necessary to conduct their businesses. There can be no
assurance that violations of environmental laws will not occur in the future as
a result of the inability to obtain permits, human error, equipment failure or
other causes. Any permit revocations could require the combined company to cease
or limit production at one or more facilities, which could seriously harm the
combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, the failure to comply with present and future regulations could
restrict the combined company's ability to expand facilities or could require
the

combined company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant
expenses to comply with environmental regulations.

     Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater
compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.
The combined company will operate in several environmentally sensitive locations
and will be subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas
of political, business and environmental groups. Changes or restrictions on
discharge limits, emissions levels, permitting requirements and material storage
or handling may require a higher than anticipated level of capital investment
or, depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors, plant
relocation. Compliance with new or existing regulations could seriously harm the
combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

SANMINA IS SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES AT SITES OPERATED BY ACQUIRED
COMPANIES AND COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND
RELATED ACTIVITIES AT THESE SITES.

     In November 1997, Sanmina acquired Elexsys International Inc., which became
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina. Several facilities owned or occupied by
Elexsys at the time of the acquisition, or formerly owned or occupied by Elexsys
or companies acquired by Elexsys, had either soil or groundwater contamination
underneath or near the facility. For example, the Von Karman Avenue, Irvine,
California facility, a printed circuit board manufacturing plant, has solvent
contamination in soil and groundwater and is currently under investigation by
the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). Sanmina has been
pumping and treating groundwater for a number of years. By letter dated June 8,
2001, the RWQCB threatened to issue a Clean-up and Abatement Order to address
concerns about additional investigation and remediation. No such order has been
issued, and Sanmina is working with the RWQCB to address their concerns. To
date, the cost of the various investigations and of operating the remediation
system at the Irvine facility have not materially affected Sanmina's financial
condition. In the event Sanmina is required to undertake additional groundwater
or soil cleanup, the cost of such cleanup is likely to be substantial. However,
Sanmina believes, based on the information currently available to it, that the
potential cost of any groundwater or soil clean-up would not materially affect
Sanmina's financial condition. Currently, Sanmina is unable to anticipate
whether any third party claims will be brought against it for the existence of
the contamination at the Irvine facility.

     At two facilities formerly owned or occupied by a predecessor company to
Elexsys in Mountain View, California, Sanmina has been required by the
California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) to undertake
investigation of soil and groundwater. DTSC has advised Sanmina that no further
investigation will be required at one of the two facilities. At the other
facility, test results have not been sufficient to enable Sanmina to determine
whether or not cleanup activities will be required; however, Sanmina does not
believe any such activities will be required. Sanmina has not been ordered to
undertake any soil or groundwater cleanup activities at either of the two former
Mountain View facilities. Nevertheless, the process of remediating contaminated
soil and groundwater is costly, and if Sanmina is required to undertake
substantial remediation activities at one or more of the former Elexsys
facilities, the costs of such activities may materially affect Sanmina's
financial condition.

     In November 1998, Sanmina acquired Altron Incorporated, which became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina. Altron was advised in 1993 by Olin
Corporation that contamination resulting from activities of prior owners of
property owned by Olin and located close to the Altron manufacturing plant in
Wilmington, Massachusetts, had migrated under the Altron plant. Olin has assumed
full responsibility for any remediation activities that may be required and has
agreed to indemnify and hold Altron harmless from any and all costs,
liabilities, fines, penalties, charges and expenses arising from and relating to
any action or requirement, whether imposed by statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, order, decree or by general principles of law to remediate, clean up
or abate contamination emanating from the Olin site. Although Sanmina believes
that Olin's assumption of responsibility will result in no remediation cost to
Altron from the contamination, there can be no assurance that Altron will not be
subject to some costs regarding this matter. Sanmina does not anticipate costs
relating to this matter, if any, will materially affect its financial condition.

     Sanmina has been named as a potentially responsible party at several
contaminated disposal sites as a result of the past disposal of hazardous waste
by companies acquired by Sanmina or their corporate predecessors. While
liabilities for such historic disposal activities have not materially affected
Sanmina's financial condition to date, there can be no guarantee that past
disposal activities will not result in liability which will materially affect
Sanmina in the future.

HADCO, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF SANMINA, IS SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL
CONTINGENCIES AT SITES CURRENTLY OR FORMERLY OPERATED BY IT AND COULD INCUR
SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RELATED ACTIVITIES AT THESE
SITES.

     Hadco is aware of certain chemicals that exist in the ground at certain of
its facilities. Hadco has notified various governmental agencies and continues
to work with them to monitor and resolve these matters. During March 1995, Hadco
received a Record Of Decision (ROD) from the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), regarding soil and groundwater
contamination at its Owego, New York facility. Based on a Remedial Investigation
and Feasibility Study (RIFS) for apparent on-site contamination at that facility
and a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS), each prepared by environmental
consultants of Hadco, the NYSDEC has approved a remediation program of
groundwater withdrawal and treatment and iterative soil flushing. Hadco has
executed a Modification of the Order on Consent to implement the approved ROD.
Capital equipment for this remediation has already been acquired by Hadco, and
future operation and maintenance costs, which will be incurred and expended over
the estimated life of the program of the next 28 years, are estimated at between
$40,000 and $100,000 per year. In the summer of 1998, NYSDEC took additional
samples from a wetland area near Hadco's Owego facility. Analytical reports of
earlier sediment samples indicated the presence of certain inorganics. The new
samples showed elevated levels of certain metals, but NYSDEC has not made a
determination as to the potential source of such metals, the remedial action to
be taken, or the persons to undertake and/or pay for any remediation. There can
be no assurance that Hadco and/or other third parties will not be required to
conduct additional investigations and remediation at that location, the costs of
which are currently indeterminable.

     Hadco has commenced the operation of a groundwater extraction system at its
Derry, New Hampshire, facility to address certain groundwater contamination and
migration control issues. It is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the
length of time remedial activity will have to be performed. However, it is
anticipated that the groundwater extraction system will be operated for at least
30 years. There can be no assurance that Hadco will not be required to conduct
additional investigations and remediation relating to the Derry facility. The
total costs of such groundwater extraction system and of conducting any
additional investigations and remediation relating to the Derry facility are not
fully determinable.

     From 1974 to 1980, Hadco operated a printed circuit manufacturing facility
in Florida as a lessee. In June 1999, Hadco, Gould Electronics, Inc. and the
Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) entered into a Settlement
Agreement which provides that Hadco and Gould will undertake remedial action
based on a Supplemental Contamination Assessment Report and a later Feasibility
Study, which has been prepared by a consultant to Hadco and Gould and approved
by the FDEP. The remedial capital costs are estimated to be $1.4 million. In
addition, ongoing monitoring and operation and maintenance costs are estimated
to be $1.4 million, which includes operation of the remediation system for 8
years and monitoring for 30 years. Actual remedial activities have not yet
commenced.

     In March 1993, the EPA notified Hadco Santa Clara of its potential
liability for maintenance and remediation costs in connection with a hazardous
waste disposal facility operated by Casmalia Resources, a California Limited
Partnership, in Santa Barbara County, California. In June 1997, the United
States District Court in Los Angeles, California, approved and entered a Consent
Decree among the EPA and 49 entities (including Hadco Santa Clara) acting
through the Casmalia Steering Committee (CSC). The Consent Decree sets forth the
terms and conditions under which the CSC will carry out work aimed at final
closure of the site. Certain closure activities will be performed by the CSC.
Under the Consent Decree, the settling parties will work with the EPA to pursue
the non-settling parties to ensure they participate in contributing to the
closure and long-term operation and maintenance of the facility.

     In May 2000, Sanmina was notified by the city of Santa Clara, California,
of a number of alleged wastewater discharge and other violations of
environmental laws by one of Sanmina's plants. Sanmina cooperated with Santa
Clara to address the city's concerns regarding the plant's operations and
subsequently settled this matter with the city. Santa Clara did not file any
lawsuit against Sanmina in connection with this matter.

     In March 2001, Sanmina acquired approximately 94% of the outstanding shares
and convertible debentures of Segerstrom. It is possible that previous
operations have contaminated soil and/or groundwater at Segerstrom facilities.
At the current time, Sanmina believes that the estimated environmental
liabilities associated with the Segerstrom facilities are approximately $4.4
million. Sanmina believes, based on the limited information currently available,
that the cost of any groundwater or soil clean-up that may be required would not
harm Sanmina's business, financial condition and results of operations.
Nevertheless, the process of remediating contaminated soil and groundwater is
costly, and if Sanmina is required to undertake substantial remediation
activities at one or more of the former Segerstrom facilities, there can be no
assurance that the costs of such activities would not harm Sanmina's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

SCI IS SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES AT SITES OPERATED BY SCI AND COULD
INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND RELATED ACTIVITIES AT
THESE SITES.

     SCI has undertaken remediation activities for groundwater contamination at
Plants 1 and 4 in Huntsville, Alabama. The applicable regulatory authorities
have granted "no further action status" with regard to these remediation
projects. In addition, Plant 34 in Brockville, Ontario, Canada has contaminated
soil and groundwater which Nortel Networks is remediating. In addition, Plant 34
in Brockville, Ontario, Canada has groundwater contamination that Nortel
Networks is remediating to comply with applicable standards. Nortel Networks has
agreed to indemnify SCI for any loss it incurs as a result of claims by third
parties relating to the groundwater contamination or the work associated with
the cleanup of the contamination. However, there may also be soil and/or
groundwater contamination at other current or former SCI manufacturing
facilities which has yet to be discovered and could give rise to material
remediation obligations and/or other liabilities.

     In the course of preparing its plants located in Arab, Alabama, and
Colorado Springs, Colorado, for sale, SCI conducted a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment and Limited Compliance Review at both facilities. Both procedures
indicated the presence of lead in wipe samples obtained from surfaces in the
interior of these plants. While there are no standards for lead on surfaces in
commercial buildings, these concentrations are above residential standards not
applicable to these facilities. Remediation activities to reduce the lead
concentrations are currently underway at both plants. Lead dust has also been
identified at SCI's San Jose, California, facility. The estimated clean up costs
for identified remediation activities at these plants is approximately $900,000.

     As the manufacturing equipment that generated the lead dust is used at most
SCI manufacturing facilities, it is possible that lead dust could be present in
the interior of some or all of its current and former manufacturing facilities.
While SCI regularly monitors for airborne concentrations of lead in its
buildings and is not aware of any significant lead concentrations in excess of
the applicable OSHA standards, the presence of lead dust in these facilities
could give rise to affirmative remediation obligations and/or other liabilities
if the levels are found to be sufficiently high.

     Asbestos is present at several SCI manufacturing facilities. While this
asbestos is being managed in place pursuant to asbestos operations and
maintenance plans, the presence of asbestos could give rise to affirmative
remediation obligations and other liabilities.

     On February 1, 2000, SCI was named as a third-party defendant in an action
brought pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act based on releases of hazardous substances to the soil and
groundwater at the Allworth, Inc. solvent recycling facility in Tarrant City,
Alabama. Plaintiff Southdown, Inc., former owner of Allworth, initially brought
this cost recovery action against other prior owners of Allworth and current and
former customers of Allworth. In turn, the customer defendants named additional
customers, including SCI. On November 7, 2000, the District Court dismissed the
claims against all former customer defendants with prejudice. On December 4,
2000, Southdown, Inc. and

Southdown Environmental LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Southdown,
Inc., filed a notice of appeal of the District Court's November 7, 2000 Order,
which appeal is pending. The parties to this action have agreed to settle the
case and dismiss all claims with prejudice with each party bearing its own
costs. The current owners of the Allworth facility have agreed to indemnify the
customers of the facility, including SCI, for all necessary remediation costs.
However, should the current owner of the Allworth facility not be able to honor
its indemnification of SCI, it is possible that state or federal authorities
could require SCI to participate, along with the numerous other potentially
responsible parties, in the remediation of the soil and groundwater at the
Allworth facility.

SOME EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND KEY PERSONNEL ARE CRITICAL TO THE BUSINESS OF THE
COMBINED COMPANY AND THESE OFFICERS AND KEY PERSONNEL MAY NOT REMAIN WITH THE
COMPANY IN THE FUTURE.

     The success of the combined company depends upon the continued service of
some executive officers and other key personnel. Generally, neither Sanmina's
nor SCI's employees are bound by employment or noncompetition agreements, and
there can be no assurance that the combined company will retain its officers and
key employees, particularly its highly skilled design, process and test
engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development
of new products and processes. The competition for these employees is intense,
and the loss of key employees could negatively affect the combined company. Upon
completion of the merger, A. Eugene Sapp, Jr., chief executive officer of SCI,
will become co-chairman of Sanmina and Robert C. Bradshaw, president and chief
operating officer of SCI, will become president of EMS operations of Sanmina. If
the combined company loses the services of Jure Sola, chairman and chief
executive officer of Sanmina, Randy Furr, president and chief operating officer
of Sanmina, Mr. Sapp, Mr. Bradshaw, one or more of its other executive officers
or key employees, or if one or more of these individuals decides to join a
competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with the combined
company, the combined company's business, operating results and financial
condition could be seriously harmed.

THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS, SOME OF WHICH IS
VARIABLE INTEREST DEBT THAT IS AFFECTED BY INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS.

     In May 1999, Sanmina raised approximately $350 million through an offering
of four and one-quarter percent convertible subordinated notes due 2004 to
qualified institutional investors. In September 2000, Sanmina raised
approximately $750 million through an offering of zero coupon convertible
subordinated debentures due 2020 to qualified institutional investors. For a
description of Sanmina's outstanding indebtedness, refer to Sanmina's audited
and unaudited financial statements incorporated into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. Sanmina's other indebtedness is principally
comprised of operating, synthetic and capital leases.

     In July 1996, SCI borrowed $100 million under adjustable rate senior notes
due 2006 issued to a group of institutional investors. In March 2001, SCI
borrowed $600 million under adjustable rate senior notes due 2006 issued to a
second group of institutional investors. The interest rates under these issues
of senior notes adjust on the basis of certain changes in financial covenants
applicable to SCI. SCI also has in place two credit facilities with a group of
domestic and international banks under which SCI may borrow principal amounts up
to $325 million under a 364-day revolving credit line and up to $200 million
under a five-year credit line. SCI further has a $210 million asset
securitization program expiring November 2001 under which certain accounts
receivable may be sold by a special purpose subsidiary of SCI, with limited
recourse. In March 2000, SCI issued $575 million of its 3% convertible
subordinated notes due March 2007. The notes are convertible into SCI's common
stock and will become convertible into Sanmina common stock following the
merger. For a complete description of SCI's outstanding indebtedness, refer to
SCI's audited and unaudited financial statements incorporated herein by
reference. SCI's other debt-related liabilities include lease or guarantee
obligations under industrial revenue bonds.

     Included in the debt described above is approximately $422 million of
variable interest debt, at March 25, 2001, incurred by SCI. Short term interest
rate changes can impact SCI's interest expense on this debt, as well as the
discount (reflected in interest expense) on its accounts receivable sold under
SCI's asset

securitization agreement. The fluctuations in interest rates may have an effect
on operating results of the combined company.

     The level of the combined company's indebtedness, among other things,
could:

     - make it difficult for the combined company to make payments on the notes
       and leases;

     - make it difficult for the combined company to obtain any necessary future
       financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
       requirements or other purposes;

     - require the combined company to dedicate a substantial portion of its
       expected cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, which
       would reduce the amount of its expected cash flow available for other
       purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures;

     - limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the
       combined company's business; and

     - make the combined company more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in
       its business.

     The combined company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the
future.

FAILURE TO MANAGE THE COMBINED COMPANY'S GROWTH MAY SERIOUSLY HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     Sanmina's and SCI's businesses have grown in recent years through both
internal expansion and acquisitions, and continued growth may cause a
significant strain on the combined company's infrastructure and internal
systems. To manage the combined company's growth effectively, the combined
company must continue to improve and expand its management information systems.
The combined company will face additional growth management challenges,
particularly as a result of Sanmina's recent acquisitions in Europe and Brazil.
Future acquisitions, both in the United States and internationally, could place
additional strains on the combined company's management infrastructure. If the
combined company is unable to manage growth effectively, its results of
operations could be harmed.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS MAY HARM THE OPERATIONS OF THE
COMBINED COMPANY.

     Sanmina's and SCI's existing international operations and plans to expand
international operations involve risks, and the failure to effectively expand
internationally could harm the combined company's operating results. Sanmina
opened its first overseas facility, located in Dublin, Ireland, in June 1997.
During June 2000 and July 2000, Sanmina acquired operations in Ireland, Sweden,
Finland, Malaysia and China. In October 2000, Sanmina acquired a 49.9% ownership
interest in INBOARD, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Siemens AG, located in
Germany. By virtue of the Segerstrom acquisition, Sanmina acquired operations in
Sweden, Finland, Brazil, Hungary, and Scotland. SCI currently generates more
than half of its revenue from its non-U.S. operations. Additionally, much of
SCI's manufacturing material is provided by international suppliers.

     U.S. export sales by SCI approximated $175 million, $116 million and $185
million for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Sales by SCI's non-U.S.
operations amounted to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2000, $2.8 billion in fiscal 1999
and $2.1 billion in fiscal 1998. Non-U.S. sales represented 50.5% of
consolidated sales in fiscal 2000, 41.8% in fiscal 1999 and 30.9% in fiscal
1998. Property, plant and equipment investments by SCI in non-U.S. operations
were $427 million, $308 million and $271 million at June 30, 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

     Sanmina's and SCI's international sales and operations may be limited or
disrupted by the imposition of government controls, export license requirements,
political and economic instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs,
labor unrest and difficulties in staffing, coordinating communications among and
managing international operations. Additionally, the combined company's business
and operating results may be harmed by fluctuations in international currency
exchange rates as well as increases in duty rates, earnings expatriation
restrictions, difficulties in obtaining export licenses, misappropriation of
intellectual property, constraints on the combined company's ability to maintain
or increase prices and competition. Sanmina and SCI cannot assure you that the
combined company will realize the anticipated strategic benefits of its
international

expansion or that international operations will contribute positively to the
combined company's business and operating results.

     To respond to competitive pressures and customer requirements, the combined
company may further expand internationally in lower cost locations, particularly
additional locations in Asia, Central Europe and Latin America. As a result of
this possible expansion, the combined company could encounter difficulties in
scaling up production at overseas facilities and in coordinating its U.S. and
international operations. The combined company may not realize anticipated
revenue growth at new international operations. The combined company may elect
to establish start-up operations rather than acquiring existing businesses,
which would require it to recruit management and other personnel and build a
customer base at a completely new operation. Accordingly, unanticipated problems
the combined company encounters in establishing new international operations
could harm its business and operating results and cause its stock price to
decline.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN
INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES.

     SCI currently primarily conducts its international sales and purchase
transactions in U.S. dollars or under customer contract provisions that protect
against most major currency risks. SCI's largest currency risk is that
associated with its Brazilian operation. Unlike SCI's other international
operations, its Brazilian plant is directly exposed to the effects of currency
devaluation on certain customers' contracts until forward pricing is adjusted
accordingly (normally quarterly). Other currency exchange risks associated with
SCI's international operations primarily relate to current assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although SCI
endeavors to balance such items against each other where possible at individual
operations, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in mitigating
the effects of changes in currency exchange rates upon such international dollar
transactions. Changes in some international currency exchange rates impact the
geographic areas where SCI's revenue is derived. When international currencies
are devalued, manufacturing costs of plants in those countries may become more
competitive with other established plants. Sanmina's international purchase and
sale transactions are also primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, except that
Segerstrom's transactions are denominated primarily in Euros, Swedish kronors or
other European currencies. Accordingly, the combined company will be subject to
risks associated with currency fluctuations and devaluations.

SANMINA AND SCI ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
HELD BY THIRD PARTIES.

     Sanmina and SCI are subject to risks related to intellectual property
rights held by third parties. In certain cases, the combined company may find it
necessary or desirable to license or otherwise acquire rights to intellectual
property held by others. In July 2000, Sanmina settled one such dispute through
a licensing arrangement with the Lemelson Foundation. SCI is currently in
litigation with the Lemelson Foundation regarding claims that certain activities
of SCI infringe United States patents held by the Lemelson Foundation. Other
such disputes, which could involve the combined company in litigation or in
administrative proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office
or patent authorities in other countries, could arise in the future. These
proceedings could be costly to conduct and could also result in the diversion of
management time and attention. In addition, adverse determinations in any
proceedings of this nature could require the combined company to pay monetary
damages and could also result in the loss of intellectual property rights. In
the event the combined company was able to settle disputes through licensing or
similar arrangements, the costs of these licenses could be substantial.
Accordingly, future disputes regarding intellectual property rights could harm
the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

     On February 14, 2001, Gemstar-TV Guide International, Inc. and StarSight
Telecast, Inc. filed a complaint against SCI and four other respondents with the
United States International Trade Commission. With respect to SCI, the complaint
alleged certain unfair acts, including patent infringement, in the importation
of set top boxes manufactured by SCI for EchoStar Communications Corporation,
another respondent in the case. The Commission instituted an investigation
following publication of its notice in the Federal Register on March 21, 2001.
The matter is in the discovery phase, and trial is currently scheduled to
commence on December 3, 2001.

THE COMBINED COMPANY'S BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED BY THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRICAL POWER
CRISIS.

     A significant portion of Sanmina's customer base and operations are located
in the State of California, which is in the midst of an energy crisis that could
disrupt Sanmina's operations and increase Sanmina's expenses. In the event of an
acute power shortage, that is, when power reserves for the State of California
fall below 1.5%, California has on some occasions implemented, and may in the
future continue to implement, rolling blackouts throughout California. If
blackouts interrupt Sanmina's power supply, Sanmina could be temporarily unable
to continue operations at certain of its California facilities. In addition,
concerns exist that the California energy crisis could lead to worsening of
economic conditions in California which could affect the combined company's
customers in California. Power shortages in California have also caused the
wholesale price of electricity to increase, which will likely cause operating
expenses for California facilities to increase. Accordingly, the California
energy situation could adversely affect the combined company's business and
results of operations.

THE COMBINED COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO A SECURITIES CLASS ACTION SUIT IF ITS
STOCK PRICE FALLS.

     Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's stock,
some stockholders may file a securities class action litigation. Any future
securities class action litigation could be expensive and divert management's
attention and harm the combined company's business, regardless of its merits.

THE TRADING PRICE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY'S SECURITIES, INCLUDING COMMON STOCK
AND CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES, MAY BE VOLATILE, AND THE VALUE OF YOUR
INVESTMENT COULD DECLINE.

     The trading price of Sanmina's common stock and SCI's common stock has been
and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to
variations in quarterly operating results, developments in the electronics
industry, changes in general economic conditions and economic conditions in the
electronics industry and the communications sector in particular, changes in
securities analysts' recommendations regarding Sanmina's and SCI's securities
and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market prices
of technology companies and which have been unrelated to or disproportionately
impacted by the operating performance of those companies. For example, Sanmina's
common stock price has fluctuated from a high of approximately $60.50 to a low
of approximately $17.53 during the 52 weeks ended August 9, 2001, and SCI's
common stock price has fluctuated from a high of approximately $65.125 to a low
of approximately $15.53 during the 52 weeks ended August 9. These broad market
fluctuations may cause the market price of the combined company's common stock
to decline, which could diminish the value of your investment.

     In addition, Sanmina and SCI each have outstanding several classes of
convertible subordinated notes. The Sanmina notes are not traded on a national
securities exchange or market. However, inter-institutional trading markets do
exist for these securities. The SCI 3% convertible subordinated notes are listed
on the New York Stock Exchange and will remain outstanding as an obligation of
SCI following the merger. As a result of the merger, the SCI 3% notes may not
qualify for continued listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The market price
of these securities is likely to be affected by the same factors that will
affect the market price for the combined company's common stock.

                  THE SPECIAL MEETING OF SANMINA STOCKHOLDERS

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by Sanmina's board of directors in
connection with the proposed merger. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is
first being furnished to stockholders of Sanmina on or about [          ], 2001.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting of stockholders of Sanmina is scheduled to be held as

         [          ], 2001
         [          ], local time
         [LOCATION]

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting is being held to approve the issuance of shares of
Sanmina common stock to SCI stockholders in connection with the merger, to
change Sanmina's corporate name to [          ] effective upon the consummation
of the merger and to transact any other business that properly comes before the
special meeting or any adjournment thereof.

     If the Sanmina stockholders do not approve the proposal to change Sanmina's
corporate name to [          ], SCI will not be obligated to complete the
merger. Accordingly, unless SCI waives this condition, the merger would not be
consummated even if Sanmina's stockholders approved the issuance of Sanmina
common stock to the SCI stockholders.

     If the stockholders of Sanmina approve the proposals and the other
conditions to the completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, Sun
Acquisition Subsidiary will merge with and into SCI, and SCI will survive the
merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina. You will not receive any
additional shares of Sanmina common stock or be required to exchange your
Sanmina stock certificates in connection with the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE SANMINA BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The members of the board of directors of Sanmina, excluding Joseph M.
Schell who abstained from voting, unanimously concluded that the merger
agreement and the merger are fair to and in the best interests of Sanmina's
stockholders, and the board unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote
FOR the proposal to approve the issuance of Sanmina common stock to SCI
stockholders in connection with the merger and the change of Sanmina's corporate
name to [          ] effective upon the consummation of the merger.

STOCKHOLDER RECORD DATE FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING

     Sanmina's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
[          ], 2001 as the record date for determination of Sanmina stockholders
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date,
there were [          ] shares of Sanmina common stock outstanding, held by
approximately [       ] holders of record.

MAJORITY VOTE OF SANMINA STOCKHOLDERS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE STOCKHOLDER
PROPOSALS

     A majority of the outstanding shares of Sanmina common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting must be represented, either in person or by proxy,
to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. The affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the shares of Sanmina common stock represented
at the special meeting is required to approve the issuance of Sanmina common
stock in connection with the merger. The affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the shares of Sanmina common stock outstanding and entitled
to vote is required to approve the change of Sanmina's corporate name to [     ]
effective upon the consummation of the merger. You are entitled to one vote for
each share of Sanmina common stock held by you on the record date on each
proposal to be presented to stockholders at the special meeting.

     On the record date for the special meeting, directors and executive
officers of Sanmina and their affiliates held approximately [       ] shares of
Sanmina common stock representing approximately [  ]% of all outstanding shares
of Sanmina common stock as of the record date.

     Sanmina executive officers and directors, in their capacity as
stockholders, have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of a voting
agreement with Sanmina and SCI, to vote their shares of Sanmina common stock in
favor of the approval of share issuance and the name change. As of the record
date these stockholders held approximately [       ] shares of Sanmina common
stock representing approximately [  ]% of the outstanding shares of Sanmina
common stock as of the record date.

PROXIES

  Voting By Proxy Card

     All shares of Sanmina common stock represented by properly executed proxy
card received before or at the special meeting will, unless the proxies are
revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxy
cards. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card, the
shares will be voted FOR approval of the share issuance and the name change. You
are urged to mark a box on the proxy card to indicate how to vote your shares.

     If a properly executed proxy card is returned and the stockholder has
instructed the proxies to abstain from voting on the share issuance in
connection with the merger, the Sanmina common stock represented by the proxy
will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining a
quorum, but will not be voted for or against the stockholder proposals, thereby
having the effect of being a vote against the stockholder proposals. If your
shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct
such institution how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned
by a broker holding shares in the name of a brokerage firm or bank, which
indicates that the broker or bank does not have instructions or discretionary
authority to vote on approval of the proposals, the shares will be considered
present at the meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum, but will not be
considered to have been voted in favor of approval of the proposals. Your broker
or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by
following the information provided to you by your broker or bank.

     Because the approval of the name change requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of Sanmina common stock outstanding on the record date,
abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes will have the same effect as
a vote against this proposal.

     Sanmina does not expect that any matters other than those set forth above
will be brought before the special meeting. If, however, other matters are
properly presented, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with
their judgment with respect to those matters, unless authority to do so is
withheld in the proxy.

  Voting by Telephone or on the Internet

     Registered stockholders of Sanmina can simplify their voting and save us
expense by calling 1-800-240-6326 or by voting via the Internet at
http://www.eproxy.com/sanm/. We provide telephone and Internet voting
information on the proxy card. A company number and a control number, located at
the top right on the back of the proxy card, is designed to verify the
stockholder's identity, allow the stockholder to vote such stockholder's shares
and confirm that we have properly recorded such stockholder's voting
instructions.

     If you do not choose to vote by telephone or Internet, you may still return
your proxy card, properly signed, and we will vote the shares in accordance with
your directions. You can specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes
on your proxy card. If you sign and return your proxy card without specifying
choices, we will vote the shares as recommended by our board of directors. IF
YOU DO VOTE BY TELEPHONE OR ON THE INTERNET, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO RETURN YOUR
PROXY CARD.

REVOCATION OF PROXIES

     You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by:

     - notifying in writing the secretary of Sanmina at 2700 North First Street,
       San Jose, California 95134;

     - properly submitting a subsequent proxy card;

     - properly submitting a subsequent proxy by telephone or on the Internet;
       or

     - appearing in person and voting at the special meeting.

     Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself constitute the
revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Sanmina and SCI will share the expenses incurred in connection with the
printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Sanmina will also
request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of Sanmina common
stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy statement/prospectus
to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will reimburse the
holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Sanmina has retained
[          ] to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify records related
to the solicitations. [          ] will receive a fee of approximately
$[          ] plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for such services.
Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and
other electronic means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the
directors, officers or employees of Sanmina. No additional compensation will be
paid to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation.

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to you in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by SCI's board of directors in
connection with the proposed merger. This joint proxy statement/ prospectus is
first being furnished to stockholders of SCI on or about [               ],
2001.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting of stockholders of SCI is scheduled to be held as
follows:

         [               ], 2001
         [          ], local time
         [LOCATION]

PURPOSE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting, SCI will ask you to consider and vote upon a
proposal to approve and adopt the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of July 13, 2001, by and among Sanmina Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina, and SCI Systems, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, and the merger provided for therein.

     If the stockholders of SCI approve and adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger and the other conditions to completion of the merger are
satisfied or waived, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary will merge with and into SCI,
and SCI will survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina. You
will be entitled to receive 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock for each share
of SCI common stock you hold at the effective time of the merger.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE SCI BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors of SCI has approved and adopted the merger agreement
and has determined that the merger, upon the terms and conditions contained in
the merger agreement, is in the best interests of, and is on terms that are fair
to, SCI's stockholders. The board of directors unanimously recommends that the
stockholders vote FOR the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
approve the merger.

STOCKHOLDERS RECORD DATE FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING

     SCI's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
[               ], 2001 as the record date for determination of SCI stockholders
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. On the record date,
there were [       ] shares of SCI common stock outstanding, held by
approximately [     ] holders of record.

MAJORITY VOTE OF SCI STOCKHOLDERS REQUIRED FOR ADOPTION AND APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT

     You are entitled to one vote for each share of SCI common stock held by you
on the record date on each proposal to be presented to stockholders at the
special meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares of SCI common stock
entitled to vote at the special meeting must be represented, either in person or
by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the special meeting. SCI will count shares
of its common stock represented in person or by proxy for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting. SCI will also
treat shares that abstain from voting as shares that are present and entitled to
vote at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

     The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of
SCI common stock outstanding on the record date is required to approve and adopt
the merger agreement and approve the merger.

     SCI executive officers and directors, including [       ], in their
capacity as stockholders, have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of a
voting agreement with SCI and Sanmina, to vote their shares of SCI common stock
in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of
the merger. These executive officers and directors have delivered proxies to
Sanmina which give Sanmina the initial right to vote such shares in favor of the
merger. As of the record date these stockholders held approximately [       ]
shares of SCI common stock representing approximately [     ]% of the
outstanding shares of SCI common stock as of the record date.

PROXIES

  Voting By Proxy Card

     All shares of SCI common stock represented by properly executed proxy cards
received before or at the special meeting will, unless the proxies are revoked,
be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxy cards. If no
instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card, the shares will be
voted FOR approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the merger. You are
urged to mark a box on the proxy card to indicate how to vote your shares.

     If a properly executed proxy card is returned and the stockholder has
instructed the proxies to abstain from voting on approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and approval of the merger, the SCI common stock represented by
the proxy will be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of
determining a quorum, but will not be voted for or against approval of the
merger, thereby having the effect of being a vote against approval of the
merger. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you
must instruct such institution how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy
card is returned by a broker holding shares in the name of a brokerage firm or
bank, which indicates that the broker or bank does not have instructions or
discretionary authority to vote on adoption of the merger agreement, the shares
will be considered present at the meeting for the purpose of determining a
quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of approval and
adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of merger. Your broker or bank
will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by
following the information provided to you by your broker or bank.

     Because approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of SCI common
stock outstanding on the record date, abstentions, failures to vote and broker
non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the merger.

     SCI does not expect that any matter other than approval and adoption of the
merger agreement and approval of the merger will be brought before the special
meeting. If, however, other matters are properly presented, the persons named as
proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment with respect to those
matters, unless authority to do so is withheld in the proxy.

  Voting by Telephone or on the Internet

     Registered stockholders of SCI can simplify their voting and save us
expense by calling [          ] or by voting via the Internet at
[               ]. We provide telephone and Internet voting information on the
proxy card. A control number, located above the stockholder's name and address
on the lower left of the proxy card, is designed to verify the stockholder's
identity, allow the stockholder to vote such stockholder's shares and confirm
that we have properly recorded such stockholder's voting instructions.

     If you do not choose to vote by telephone or Internet, you may still return
your proxy card, properly signed, and we will vote the shares in accordance with
your directions. You can specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes
on your proxy card. If you sign and return your proxy card without specifying
choices, we will vote the shares as recommended by our board of directors. IF
YOU DO VOTE BY TELEPHONE OR ON THE INTERNET, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO RETURN YOUR
PROXY CARD.

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     Any proxy you give may be revoked at any time before it is voted at the
special meeting. You may revoke a proxy by doing any of the following:

     - sending a signed written notice stating that you would like to revoke
       your proxy;

     - completing and submitting a new proxy card;

     - attending the special meeting and voting in person; or

     - properly submitting a subsequent proxy by telephone or on the Internet.

     Simply attending the special meeting will not revoke your proxy; you must
request a ballot and vote at the special meeting.

     To be effective, any written notice of revocation or any new proxy card
must be received by SCI Systems, Inc., 2101 West Clinton Avenue, Huntsville,
Alabama 35805, Attention: Michael M. Sullivan, Secretary, prior to the time of
the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself
constitute the revocation of a proxy.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Sanmina and SCI will share the expenses incurred in connection with the
printing and mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. SCI will also
request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of SCI common
stock beneficially owned by others to send this joint proxy statement/prospectus
to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will reimburse the
holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Sanmina has retained
[          ] to aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify records related
to the solicitations. [          ] will receive a fee of approximately
$[          ] plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for such services.
Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and
other electronic means, advertisements and personal solicitation by the
directors, officers or employees of SCI. No additional compensation will be paid
to directors, officers or employees for such solicitation.

     YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY SCI STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. A
TRANSMITTAL LETTER WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SURRENDER OF STOCK CERTIFICATES
WILL BE MAILED TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER COMPLETION OF THE MERGER.

                                   THE MERGER

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes material
aspects of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement. While we believe
that the description covers the material terms of the merger, this summary may
not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read
this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents we refer to
carefully for a more complete understanding of the merger. In addition, we
incorporate important business and financial information about Sanmina and SCI
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. You may obtain the
information incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus
without charge by following the instructions in the section entitled "WHERE YOU
CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" on page 9 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

EFFECT OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF SCI COMMON STOCK

     Upon the closing of the merger, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina, will merge with and into SCI, and SCI will
survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina. Following the
merger, SCI will continue its operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Sanmina. SCI stockholders will become Sanmina stockholders, and their rights as
stockholders will be governed by the Sanmina certificate of incorporation, as
amended, the Sanmina bylaws and the laws of the State of Delaware. See
"COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SANMINA COMMON STOCK AND SCI COMMON STOCK"
on page 95 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     At the closing of the merger, by virtue of the merger and without any
action on the part of Sanmina, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary, SCI or any of their
stockholders, each share of SCI common stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time will be cancelled, extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock upon
surrender of the certificate representing such share of SCI common stock in the
manner provided for in the merger agreement, or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and bond, if required. The
exchange ratio in the merger will be appropriately adjusted in the event of any
stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification
or similar change with respect to Sanmina common stock or SCI common stock
occurring prior to the closing of the merger. However, no adjustment in the
exchange ratio will be made for changes in the relative market prices of SCI's
and Sanmina's shares. No fractional shares of Sanmina common stock will be
issued in connection with the merger. SCI stockholders will receive cash,
without interest, in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of Sanmina
common stock which would have been otherwise issuable to SCI stockholders as a
result of the merger. Each share of SCI common stock held by SCI or any direct
or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SCI immediately prior to the closing of
the merger will be cancelled and extinguished.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     During the latter half of calendar year 2000 and early calendar year 2001,
Sanmina management began considering and exploring various strategic
alternatives to broaden Sanmina's global electronics manufacturing services
presence. The objective of this strategic initiative was to expand Sanmina's
global footprint and overall electronics manufacturing services offerings in
order to better position Sanmina to meet the increasingly global manufacturing
and product requirements of Sanmina's current and potential future customers. In
particular, Sanmina's senior management believed that a larger, more global
presence and a broader range of full electronics manufacturing services would be
necessary to successfully compete for the growing number of divestiture
transactions being proposed by OEMs in the electronics industry.

     In April and May 2001, Jure Sola and Randy Furr, Sanmina's chairman and
president, respectively, and A. Eugene Sapp, Jr., SCI's chairman and chief
executive officer, engaged in informal discussions regarding a possible business
combination through a series of telephone calls and meetings. Mr. Sola and Mr.
Furr had previously discussed with Mr. Sapp the possible benefits of combining
Sanmina and SCI on a number of occasions over the past few years. In the past,
Mr. Sapp had expressed SCI's view that it wanted to pursue an independent growth
strategy. Based on a reassessment of the strategic positioning of the two
companies,

Messrs. Sola, Furr and Sapp agreed in May 2001 that there were significant
merits in considering a possible combination of the two companies. Mr. Sapp
invited Mr. Sola to provide a proposal to SCI which Mr. Sapp could present to
SCI's board of directors for its consideration.

     On May 24, 2001, Mr. Sapp received a letter from Mr. Sola proposing a stock
for stock merger at a one to one exchange ratio. Mr. Sapp advised the executive
committee of the SCI board of the proposal by Mr. Sola and of his intention to
reject the proposed exchange ratio, as to which the executive committee
concurred. Mr. Sapp responded by telephone on May 25 and expressed SCI's view
that the exchange ratio was not adequate for SCI stockholders and that an
exchange ratio should be based on relative financial contributions by each of
SCI and Sanmina to the combined company. Mr. Sapp nonetheless agreed that the
parties should further develop their understanding of each others' businesses
and the strategic merits of a possible combination and should engage in a
valuation discussion to see if the parties could come to an agreement.

     In May 2001, SCI reached agreement with Goldman Sachs as to the terms upon
which Goldman Sachs would act as SCI's financial advisor in a potential sale of
SCI.

     On May 30, 2001, Sanmina and Merrill Lynch executed an engagement letter
pursuant to which Sanmina retained Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor for a
possible business combination with SCI. The terms of this engagement letter were
approved by Sanmina's board of directors, with director Joseph M. Schell,
chairman of Merrill Lynch's technology investment banking practice, abstaining.

     In late May and early June 2001, a series of telephone conversations
involving Mr. Sapp and Mr. Sola took place. In these conversations, both parties
engaged in preliminary discussions regarding the possibility of combining the
companies. As a result of these conversations, Mr. Sapp and Sanmina's senior
management concluded that a common ground for proceeding with additional
discussions existed, and the parties determined to meet again during the week of
June 11.

     On June 6, 2001, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the SCI board of
directors, Mr. Sapp apprised the board of his discussions with Mr. Sola and the
engagement of Goldman Sachs as SCI's financial advisor. SCI's board of directors
agreed that discussions with Sanmina should proceed.

     On June 11, 2001, a regularly scheduled meeting of Sanmina's board of
directors took place. Representatives of Merrill Lynch attended this meeting and
gave a presentation regarding SCI and the strategic benefits and synergies
expected to result from the merger, as provided by Sanmina management, that the
combined company could potentially realize. Messrs. Sola and Furr presented
their strategic rationale for the transaction to the Sanmina board. The Merrill
Lynch representatives then presented a range of possible exchange ratios and
other financial analyses related to a possible combination of Sanmina and SCI.

     On June 12, 2001, Sanmina and SCI entered into a mutual nondisclosure
agreement.

     On June 12 and 13, 2001, Sanmina and SCI senior management, together with
representatives of Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, met to exchange and review
information regarding the respective companies and discuss the merits of a
possible combination. At this meeting, it was agreed that the parties needed to
review more detailed financial information regarding the respective companies,
and a follow-up meeting was scheduled for this review.

     On June 15 and 16, 2001, Mr. Sola and Mr. Sapp had several telephone
conversations in which various exchange ratios were discussed but not agreed to.

     On July 2 and 3, 2001, Sanmina and SCI senior management, together with
representatives of Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, met again and discussed the
business and financial prospects of the two companies, potential exchange ratios
and other transaction terms. At these meetings, the parties agreed in principle
upon a fixed exchange ratio of 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock per share of
SCI common stock, subject to mutual due diligence investigations, agreement on a
definitive merger agreement and approval by the respective boards of directors.
The parties also discussed other concerns including composition of the combined
company's board of directors, roles of senior SCI management, employment
arrangements for key SCI personnel and other matters.

     On July 5, 2001, Sanmina and SCI and each of their legal and accounting
advisors began the process of conducting detailed business, legal and accounting
due diligence with respect to each other. Over the course of the next eight
days, Sanmina and SCI and their representatives and their respective legal and
financial advisors conducted negotiations relating to a definitive merger
agreement and related documents. Due diligence activities also continued during
this time.

     On July 9, 2001, the board of directors of SCI met in Atlanta and received
a report from Mr. Sapp regarding the discussions held with representatives of
Sanmina and with respect to SCI's current condition and prospects.
Representatives of Goldman Sachs and counsel to SCI also attended this meeting.
G. William Speer of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy LLP, SCI's outside legal
counsel, advised the members of the board concerning their legal requirements as
directors generally and, more particularly, in the context of a merger
transaction. The board of directors of SCI considered the terms of the proposed
merger, discussed the advantages and disadvantages to SCI and its stockholders
as a result of the proposed merger, discussed with Goldman Sachs certain
financial aspects of the proposed merger and authorized management to continue
discussions relating to the proposed merger, subject to further action by the
board of directors of SCI.

     On July 13, 2001, the board of directors of SCI held a meeting in the
offices of Goldman Sachs in New York to discuss and review the draft merger
agreement. All directors participated in the meeting. Mr. Sapp reviewed the
current conditions of SCI, the history of the meetings and discussions held
between SCI and Sanmina and the possible effects of a combination of SCI and
Sanmina. Mr. Sapp, James E. Moylan, Jr., SCI's senior vice president and chief
financial officer, and Mr. Speer briefed the directors on the results of the
business and legal due diligence investigation conducted with respect to Sanmina
and Mr. Speer reviewed the draft merger agreement and related agreements and
summarized the few remaining open issues. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
presented financial analysis with respect to certain aspects of the proposed
merger and Goldman Sachs delivered its oral opinion, later confirmed in writing,
that as of such date, the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view
to the holders of SCI common stock. The board of directors voted unanimously to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, subject to resolution to the
satisfaction of SCI officers' of the few remaining items, and determined that
the merger, upon the terms and conditions contained in the merger agreement, is
in the best interests of, and is on terms that are fair to, SCI's stockholders.

     On July 13, 2001, the board of directors of Sanmina held a meeting by
telephone conference call and all directors participated to discuss and review a
draft of the merger agreement in detail. Members of Sanmina's management,
including Messrs. Furr and Sola and Rick Ackel, Sanmina's chief financial
officer, reviewed the business and legal due diligence conducted on SCI.
Christopher D. Mitchell of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Sanmina's outside
legal counsel, reviewed the draft merger agreement and related agreements and
summarized the few remaining open issues. Mr. Mitchell also reviewed with the
Sanmina board of directors the legal principles applicable to the proposed
merger, including the board's fiduciary duties and authority in considering the
proposed merger and the share issuance by Sanmina. Representatives of Merrill
Lynch then presented a report concerning certain financial aspects of the
proposed merger and Merrill Lynch delivered its oral opinion, subsequently
confirmed in writing, that as of the date of such opinion, the exchange ratio
was fair from a financial point of view to Sanmina. The board of directors,
excluding Mr. Schell who abstained from voting due to his relationship with
Merrill Lynch, voted unanimously to approve the merger agreement, the merger,
the issuance of Sanmina common stock to SCI stockholders in the merger and the
change of Sanmina's corporate name.

     Negotiations regarding the remaining open issues in the merger agreement
continued during the afternoon and evening of July 13, 2001. During the late
evening on July 13, SCI and Sanmina entered into the merger agreement. At 12:01
a.m. on Monday, July 16, 2001, Sanmina and SCI issued a joint press release
announcing the merger.

     On August 10, Sanmina and SCI amended the merger agreement to remove the
requirement that Sanmina stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger by executing and delivering the amended and restated merger agreement.

JOINT REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     The boards of directors of Sanmina and SCI have determined that a combined
company would be positioned to compete more effectively in the global
electronics manufacturing services market, thereby increasing the potential for
improved long-term operating and financial results. In particular, the boards
believe that the merger will create the opportunity for Sanmina and SCI to:

     - build an industry-leading electronics manufacturing services company
       offering customers technology leadership and the ability to provide
       end-to-end system solution capabilities;

     - enhance their ability to serve their existing customer base through
       increased scale, the ability to provide a broader range of manufacturing
       services, and enhanced global order fulfillment capabilities;

     - combine, and thereby broaden and diversify, their customer bases and
       revenue streams in high growth sectors of the electronics industry;

     - utilize Sanmina's vertical integration in the areas of printed circuit
       board fabrication, backplane assembly, enclosures, cable assemblies and
       other components and subsystems across a larger revenue base and thereby
       realize additional operating efficiencies; and

     - use their combined financial strength to better position the combined
       company to compete more effectively for original equipment manufacturer
       divestitures or other acquisition opportunities.

RECOMMENDATION OF SANMINA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SANMINA'S REASONS FOR THE
MERGER

     In reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement and approve the
merger, the share issuance and the name change, the Sanmina board of directors
consulted with Sanmina's management, its financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, and
legal counsel. The Sanmina board of directors believed that the combined
experience of its members and Sanmina management enabled the Sanmina board of
directors to make an informed decision regarding the merger agreement, the
merger, the share issuance and the name change.

     At a meeting held on July 13, 2001, the board of directors of Sanmina,
excluding Joseph M. Schell who abstained from voting due to his relationship
with Merrill Lynch, unanimously concluded that the merger is consistent with and
in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Sanmina and is fair to, and
in the best interests of, Sanmina and the Sanmina stockholders. Accordingly, the
board of directors determined to recommend that the Sanmina stockholders approve
the issuance of the shares of Sanmina common stock to SCI stockholders in
connection with the merger and the change of Sanmina's corporate name. The
summary set forth below briefly describes certain of the reasons, factors and
information taken into account by the Sanmina board in reaching its conclusion.
The Sanmina board did not assign any relative or specific weights to the factors
considered in reaching such determination, and individual directors may have
given differing weights to different factors.

     In reaching its determination, the Sanmina board consulted with Sanmina's
management and legal and financial advisors, and carefully considered a number
of factors, including:

     - the potential strategic benefits of the merger, including without
       limitation, the expanded global presence of the combined company and the
       ability of the combined company to provide a full range of electronics
       manufacturing services in major technology centers throughout the world;

     - the strength of the combined company as a global EMS business, including
       the ability of the combined company to effectively compete for major
       multinational OEM asset divestiture transactions and other new business;

     - historical information concerning Sanmina's and SCI's respective
       businesses, prospects, financial performance and condition, operations,
       technology, management and competitive position, including public reports
       concerning results of operations for each company filed with the
       Securities and Exchange Commission;

     - Sanmina management's view of the financial condition, results of
       operations and businesses of Sanmina and SCI before and after giving
       effect to the merger;

     - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information with respect to Sanmina common stock
       and SCI common stock;

     - the consideration to be received by SCI stockholders in the merger and
       the relationship between the current and historical market values of
       Sanmina common stock and SCI common stock and a comparison of comparable
       acquisition transactions;

     - the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties'
       respective representations, warranties and covenants, and the conditions
       to their respective obligations, are reasonable;

     - the prospects of Sanmina independent of SCI;

     - the potential for other parties to enter into strategic relationships
       with or to acquire Sanmina or SCI, and the available acquisition
       candidates for Sanmina to pursue in furtherance of its globalization
       strategy;

     - the opinion of Merrill Lynch that, as of the date of such opinion, the
       exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to Sanmina.
       Merrill Lynch's opinion was subject to the assumptions made, matters
       considered and certain qualifications and limitations on the scope of the
       review undertaken noted in the opinion and described under "Opinion of
       Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated" beginning on page 49
       of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You should carefully read both
       that section and the opinion that is attached to this document as Annex
       B;

     - the impact of the merger on Sanmina's customers and employees; and

     - reports from management, legal and financial advisors as to the results
       of the due diligence investigation of SCI.

     In its deliberations, the Sanmina board of directors identified several
potential negative factors, including the following:

     - the risk that the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized;

     - the challenges of integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures
       and organizations of the two companies, particularly given the geographic
       separation of their facilities;

     - the risk that SCI's financial results will not meet expectations given
       the current slowdown in demand for electronics products sold by SCI's
       principal customers;

     - the risk of disruption of sales momentum as a result of uncertainties
       created by the announcement of the merger or customers' concerns
       regarding integration of the combined company's operations and the
       ability of the combined company to continue to provide a high level of
       service;

     - the risk that the merger might not occur despite the parties' efforts,
       even if approved by the holders of each company's common stock;

     - the substantial costs and financial statement charges to be incurred in
       connection with the merger, including costs of integrating the businesses
       and transaction expenses arising from the merger;

     - the effect of the public announcement of the merger and the possibility
       that the merger might not be consummated on (a) Sanmina's sales and
       operating results and (b) Sanmina's ability to attract and retain key
       management, marketing and technical personnel; and

     - other applicable risks described in the section of this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 20.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
Sanmina board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but includes the
material factors considered by the Sanmina board of directors. In view of the
complexity and wide variety of information and factors, both positive and
negative, considered

by the Sanmina board of directors, it did not find it practical to quantify,
rank or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the factors considered.
In addition, the Sanmina board did not reach any specific conclusion with
respect to each of the factors considered, or any aspect of any particular
factor. Instead, the Sanmina board of directors conducted an overall analysis of
the factors described above, including discussions with Sanmina's management and
Sanmina's legal, financial and accounting advisors. In considering the factors
described above, individual members of the Sanmina board of directors may have
given different weights to different factors.

     The Sanmina board considered all these factors as a whole and believed the
factors supported its determination to approve the merger.

     AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE FACTORS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE
MEMBERS OF SANMINA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, EXCLUDING JOSEPH M. SCHELL WHO
ABSTAINED FROM VOTING DUE TO HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MERRILL LYNCH, UNANIMOUSLY
CONCLUDED THAT THE MERGER IS CONSISTENT WITH AND IN FURTHERANCE OF THE LONG-TERM
BUSINESS STRATEGY OF SANMINA AND IS FAIR TO, AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF,
SANMINA AND SANMINA STOCKHOLDERS AND THAT SANMINA SHOULD PROCEED WITH THE
MERGER.

RECOMMENDATION OF, AND FACTORS CONSIDERED BY, THE SCI BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     In reaching its decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the
merger, the SCI board of directors consulted with SCI's management and its legal
counsel and financial advisor. SCI did not seek out alternative acquirers or
merger partners. The SCI board determined that Sanmina offered the greatest
potential for long-term value to the SCI stockholders. The SCI board of
directors believed that the combined experience of the members of the board of
directors and the executive officers of SCI enabled the SCI board of directors
to make an informed decision with respect to the terms of the proposed merger
and a decision not to seek alternative acquirers or merger partners. Among the
factors considered by the SCI board of directors in its deliberations were the
following:

     Terms of the Transaction.  In reaching its decision, the SCI board of
directors reviewed SCI's business, results of operations, and near- and
long-term prospects as an independent entity, its business model, and the
financial aspects and timing of the merger as compared to continuing as an
independent company. SCI's board of directors also considered SCI's strategic
position in its industry, its management succession planning, its near-and
long-term prospects and the anticipated value of the combined company resulting
from the merger. The SCI board of directors viewed Sanmina as having a track
record that demonstrates a clear ability to compete effectively in the
electronic manufacturing services industry and, in particular, the high-end
communications segment of the electronic manufacturing services industry, a
segment in which SCI has a much smaller presence. In analyzing the terms of the
proposed transaction with Sanmina, the SCI board of directors took into account:

     - the current and historical market prices of Sanmina common stock;

     - the risks and possible rewards associated with the ownership of Sanmina
       common stock;

     - the substantial number of shares of Sanmina common stock to be delivered
       to SCI stockholders in the merger, which reflected, in the view of the
       SCI board of directors, a fair valuation of SCI;

     - the terms of the merger agreement, including representations and
       warranties, conditions to closing and rights of termination;

     - the anticipated favorable impact of the merger on customers, suppliers
       and employees of SCI and Sanmina;

     - the expected qualification of the merger as a tax free reorganization
       under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code;

     - the likelihood that the merger would be completed; and

     - the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the effect that, as of the date of its
       opinion, the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair,
       from a financial point of view, to SCI's stockholders (the

       full text of such opinion, which sets forth assumptions made, matters
       considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with
       the opinion, is attached hereto as Annex C).

     Industry Trends.  The SCI board of directors was aware of the continuing
industry trend toward consolidation which it believed would result in a smaller
number of industry participants able to offer a more diverse range of services
and thus compete more effectively in the marketplace. Further, because of the
continued trend on the part of original equipment manufacturers to outsource
most of their manufacturing requirements, SCI's board of directors noted that a
number of OEM asset divestitures are expected in the near term on the part of
many of those manufacturers. To avail itself of new growth opportunities, both
in terms of acquiring new customers as well as participating in OEM asset
divestitures, and thus not lose market share to its competitors, SCI would
require increasing amounts of capital. Because of SCI's narrowing net margins
and a substantial slowdown in the personal computer industry, one of the areas
in which SCI has an industry leading presence, and because of the decline in the
price of its common stock, increasing amounts of capital were becoming harder to
obtain on acceptable terms.

     Strategic Alternatives and Factors Relating to Sanmina.  The SCI board of
directors' deliberations included consideration of the likelihood of effecting
alternative transactions and the alternative of continuing as an independent
company. The SCI board of directors also considered the financial terms of the
transaction in view of certain industry valuation metrics (including revenue,
gross margins, net after tax profits and historical growth rates) and comparable
transactions. The SCI board of directors took into account the views expressed
by SCI management that Sanmina occupies a prominent position in the electronic
manufacturing services industry generally, and as a provider of products for
communications products specifically, and that Sanmina appears to be a good
strategic fit for SCI. The SCI board of directors believes that Sanmina would be
a good strategic fit based on:

     - the larger scale of the combined company bringing greater credibility to
       customers for new business and to original equipment manufacturers with
       respect to asset divestitures;

     - the opportunity to expand relationships with common customers and the
       opportunity for each company to establish relationships with customers of
       the other company;

     - the economies of scale and control, especially in purchasing and supply
       chain management;

     - the perception of a compatible product mix, cultural fit and customer
       base between the two companies;

     - Sanmina's enhanced product line removing SCI from being what has
       historically been a commodity style business;

     - Sanmina's historically higher margins and SCI's sales resulting in the
       combined company potentially having operating margins higher than average
       operating margins in the industry;

     - the opportunities to utilize Sanmina's vertical integration capabilities
       in SCI's business;

     - the strong balance sheet of the combined company providing financial
       capital and flexibility;

     - Sanmina's traditional strength in areas of the industry where SCI has
       traditionally been weak, in particular the communications segment,
       resulting in a diversified combined company with strength across all
       areas of the electronic manufacturing services spectrum;

     - other synergies expected to be realized from the combined companies
       operations; and

     - the increased global footprint and customer presence of the combined
       company.

     The SCI board of directors also identified and considered a number of
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including:

     - the risk that its operations might not be successfully integrated with
       the operations of Sanmina;

     - the risk that, despite efforts after the merger to retain them, key
       personnel might leave the combined company;

     - the risk that the combined company will have increased exposure to the
       communications sector and could be adversely affected in the event of a
       substantial slowdown in this sector;

     - the risk that gross margins may decline as more competitors enter the
       higher margin electronic manufacturing service sectors in which Sanmina
       competes;

     - the difficulty of managing operations in the different geographic
       locations in which SCI and Sanmina operate and will continue to operate;
       and

     - the risk that the potential synergistic benefits of the merger might not
       be fully realized.

     The SCI board of directors believes that, overall, these negative factors
are outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger.

     Tax Treatment of the Transaction.  The SCI board of directors noted that
the merger is expected to be generally tax-free for federal income tax purposes
to SCI stockholders receiving Sanmina common stock.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by SCI's
board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material
factors considered by the SCI board of directors. In view of the complexity and
wide variety of information and factors, both positive and negative, considered
by the SCI board of directors, it did not find it practicable to quantify, rank
or otherwise assign relative or specific weights to the factors considered. In
addition, the SCI board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion with
respect to each of the factors considered, or any aspect of any particular
factor. Instead, the SCI board of directors conducted an overall analysis of the
factors described above, including discussions with SCI's management and its
legal and financial advisors. In considering the factors described above,
individual members of the SCI board of directors may have given different
weights to different factors. The SCI board of directors, after consideration of
all of these factors as a whole, believes the factors support its determination
to approve the proposed merger.

     AFTER CONSIDERING THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITH RESPECT
TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT SOME DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF
SCI HAVE INTERESTS IN THE MERGER THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM, OR ARE IN ADDITION TO,
THE INTERESTS OF SCI STOCKHOLDERS GENERALLY. PLEASE SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED
"INTERESTS OF SCI DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER" BEGINNING ON PAGE 63 OF
THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

OPINION OF MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED

     Sanmina retained Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to act
as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed merger of Sanmina and
SCI. As part of the engagement, Sanmina requested that Merrill Lynch evaluate
whether the exchange ratio in the proposed merger was fair from a financial
point of view to Sanmina. On July 13, 2001, Merrill Lynch delivered to the board
of directors of Sanmina an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated July 13, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date, and
based upon and subject to the factors and the assumptions set forth in the
opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to
Sanmina.

     The full text of the Merrill Lynch opinion, which sets forth the
assumptions made, matters considered and certain qualifications and limitations
on the scope of the review undertaken by Merrill Lynch, is attached as Annex B
and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the Merrill Lynch
opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the opinion and you are urged to read the Merrill Lynch opinion in its
entirety and consider it carefully.

     The Merrill Lynch opinion was addressed to the Sanmina board of directors
for its information and was directed only to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the exchange ratio to Sanmina. The Merrill Lynch opinion did
not address any other aspect of the merger, including the underlying decision by
Sanmina to engage in the merger, and does not constitute, nor should it be
construed as, a recommendation to any Sanmina stockholder as to how such
stockholder should vote on the proposed issuance of shares of Sanmina in the
merger or any other matter related to the merger. In addition, Merrill Lynch did
not express any opinion as to the prices at which the Sanmina common stock might
trade subsequent to the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Merrill Lynch, among other things:

     - reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
       relating to Sanmina and SCI that Merrill Lynch deemed to be relevant;

     - reviewed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to
       the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of
       Sanmina and SCI, furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Sanmina
       and SCI, as well as the amount and timing of any cost savings and related
       expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger, furnished to
       or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Sanmina and SCI;

     - conducted discussions with members of senior management and
       representatives of Sanmina and SCI concerning the matters described in
       the above clauses, as well as their respective businesses and prospects
       before and after giving effect to the merger and any cost savings and
       related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger;

     - reviewed the historical market prices and valuation multiples for shares
       of Sanmina common stock and shares of SCI common stock and compared them
       with those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed
       to be relevant;

     - reviewed the results of operations of Sanmina and SCI and compared them
       with those of certain publicly traded companies that Merrill Lynch deemed
       to be relevant;

     - compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial
       terms of certain other transactions that Merrill Lynch deemed to be
       relevant;

     - participated in certain discussions among representatives of Sanmina and
       SCI and their respective financial and legal advisors;

     - considered the potential pro forma impact of the merger on Sanmina;

     - reviewed the merger agreement and other related agreements; and

     - reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into account
       such other matters as Merrill Lynch deemed necessary, including its
       assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

     In preparing its opinion, Merrill Lynch assumed and relied on the accuracy
and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it,
discussed with or reviewed by or for it, or publicly available. Merrill Lynch
did not assume any responsibility for independently verifying any such
information and did not undertake an independent evaluation or appraisal of any
assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Sanmina or SCI, and was not
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. In addition, Merrill Lynch did
not assume any obligation to conduct, nor did it conduct, any physical
inspection of the properties or facilities of Sanmina and SCI. With respect to
the financial forecasts information and the information concerning any cost
savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the merger
furnished to or discussed with Merrill Lynch by Sanmina and SCI, Merrill Lynch
assumed that such information had been reasonably prepared and reflected the
best currently available estimates and judgements of Sanmina's or SCI's
management as to the expected future financial performance of Sanmina or SCI, as
the case may be, and any cost savings and related expenses and synergies
expected to result from the merger. Merrill Lynch further assumed that the
merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

     The Merrill Lynch opinion was necessarily based upon market, economic and
other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on, and on the
information made available to it, as of July 13, 2001. Merrill Lynch assumed
that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or
approvals (contractual or otherwise) for the merger, no restrictions, including
any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed
that will have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the
merger. Merrill Lynch also assumed that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without waiver of any material
condition.

     In performing its analyses, Merrill Lynch made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business, economic, market and
financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
Merrill Lynch, Sanmina or SCI. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed
by Merrill Lynch are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
such analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such
businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses and
estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, as
described above, the Merrill Lynch opinion was among several factors taken into
consideration by the Sanmina board of directors in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, Merrill Lynch's
analyses should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Sanmina
board of directors or Sanmina's management with respect to the fairness to
Sanmina of the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement.

     At the meeting of the Sanmina board of directors held on July 13, 2001,
Merrill Lynch presented certain financial analyses accompanied by written
materials in connection with the delivery of its oral opinion at that meeting
and the delivery of its written opinion as of July 13, 2001.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by
Merrill Lynch in arriving at its opinion. Some of the financial analyses
summarized below include information presented in a tabular format. In order to
understand fully Merrill Lynch's financial analyses, the tables must be read
together with the text of the summary. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data set forth
below in tables without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses
performed by Merrill Lynch.

  Historical Relative Trading Performance

     Merrill Lynch reviewed the recent historical stock market performance of
SCI common stock and Sanmina common stock in relation to each other and reviewed
the exchange ratios implied by those relative trading values. In addition,
Merrill Lynch compared the merger agreement exchange ratio of 1.36x to the
average implied exchange ratios over certain specified time periods and noted
the amount by which the 1.36x exchange ratio constituted a premium to the
average implied exchange ratios for such periods, including the information set
forth below:

     Merrill Lynch also reviewed the per share closing price trading data of
shares of SCI common stock and shares of Sanmina common stock for the three
month and one year periods prior to and including July 12, 2001. These analyses
indicated the following trading ranges and the range of implied exchange ratios
derived from the relative per share values of SCI common stock and Sanmina
common stock:

  Publicly Traded Comparable Companies Analysis

     Merrill Lynch compared selected financial and operating data of Sanmina and
SCI with corresponding data for certain publicly traded comparable companies
that Merrill Lynch deemed relevant for the purposes of its analyses. The SCI
comparable companies and the Sanmina comparable companies were as follows
(Sanmina and SCI were excluded from the Sanmina comparable companies and the SCI
comparable companies, respectively):

                      SANMINA AND SCI COMPARABLE COMPANIES

     Merrill Lynch analyzed the total enterprise value (defined as market value
of common equity plus book value of total debt, preferred stock and minority
interest less cash) of the SCI comparable companies and the Sanmina comparable
companies as a multiple of, among other things, projected earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA,
for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001 and the ratio of the trading value
per share to cash EPS for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2001 and 2002.

     Applying the ranges of multiples derived from the SCI comparable companies
information to selected financial data from the SCI Street Case and the SCI
Management Case, Merrill Lynch estimated the following implied equity value
ranges per share of SCI common stock, before giving effect to the synergies
expected to result from the merger:

     Applying the ranges of multiples derived from the Sanmina comparable
companies information to selected financial data from the Sanmina Street Case
and the Sanmina Management Case, Merrill Lynch estimated the following implied
equity value ranges per share of Sanmina common stock, before giving effect to
the synergies expected to result from the merger:

     Based upon these analyses, Merrill Lynch calculated the following range of
implied exchange ratios based on the relative implied equity value per share,
before giving effect to the synergies expected to result from the merger, of SCI
common stock and Sanmina common stock based on the SCI Management Case and the
Sanmina Management Case, respectively:

     None of the SCI comparable companies or the Sanmina comparable companies
utilized in the above analyses for comparative purposes is, of course, identical
to SCI or Sanmina. Accordingly, a complete analysis of the results of the
foregoing calculations cannot be limited to a quantitative review of such
results and involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences
in financial and operating characteristics of the SCI comparable companies and
the Sanmina comparable companies and other factors that could affect the public
trading value of the comparable companies.

  Comparable Acquisition Analysis

     Merrill Lynch also reviewed the financial terms of certain other precedent
transactions that it deemed to be relevant. The comparable acquisitions
considered by Merrill Lynch were the following:

                                TARGET/ACQUIROR

     Based on information publicly available as of July 12, 2001, Merrill Lynch
calculated the transaction values (defined as offer value plus net debt) for the
comparable acquisitions as a multiple of, among other things, the last twelve
months EBITDA, to the extent publicly available over the relevant time period,
and offer values for the comparable acquisitions as multiples of the last twelve
months cash EPS, to the extent publicly available over the relevant time period.

     Applying the ranges of multiples derived from its review of the comparable
acquisitions, Merrill Lynch estimated the following implied equity value ranges
per share of SCI common stock, before giving effect to the synergies expected to
result from the merger:

                                                                            IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE

     Based upon (i) the implied equity values per share of SCI common stock
derived from the comparable acquisitions analyses and (ii) the implied equity
values per share of Sanmina common stock derived from the Sanmina comparable
companies analyses, Merrill Lynch calculated the following range of implied
exchange ratios, before giving effect to the synergies expected to result from
the merger:

     No company or transaction examined in the comparable acquisitions analysis
was identical to SCI or the proposed merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the
results of the foregoing comparable acquisitions analysis is

not purely mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the companies included in the comparable acquisitions transaction analysis and
other factors that could affect the offer value and the transaction
consideration.

  Merger Premium Analysis

     Based on information publicly available as of July 12, 2001, Merrill Lynch
examined for each of the comparable acquisitions the premium paid to (i) market
price one day prior to announcement, (ii) average market price during the week
prior to announcement and (iii) average market price during the four weeks prior
to announcement and compared this information to the implied premium per share
of SCI common stock, over each relevant time period, based on the merger
agreement exchange ratio of 1.36x. This analysis indicated the following
results:

  Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

     Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of SCI using the
SCI Management Case and the SCI Street Case for the fiscal years ending
September 30, 2002 through 2006. Merrill Lynch calculated a range of equity
values per share of SCI common stock based upon the sum of the respective
discounted net present value of SCI's five-year stream of projected unlevered
free cash flows plus the discounted net present value of SCI's terminal value
based on a range of multiples of its projected EBITDA for the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2006. Using discount rates ranging from 18% to 20%, based on a
weighted average cost of capital analysis of the SCI comparable companies, and
terminal value multiples of 2006 EBITDA ranging from 8.0x to 13.0x, based on an
analysis of the SCI comparable companies, Merrill Lynch calculated the following
range of implied equity values per share of SCI common stock:

                                                            IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE PER SHARE OF
                                                                    SCI COMMON STOCK

SCI Street Case (excluding expected synergies)............           $16.18 - $32.62

     Merrill Lynch also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Sanmina
using the Sanmina Management Case and the Sanmina Street Case for the fiscal
years ending September 30, 2002 through 2006. Merrill Lynch calculated a range
of equity values per share of Sanmina common stock based upon the sum of the
respective discounted net present value of Sanmina's five-year stream of
projected unlevered free cash flows plus the discounted net present value of
Sanmina's terminal value based on a range of multiples of its projected EBITDA
for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006. Using discount rates ranging from
18% to 20%, based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis of the Sanmina
comparable companies, and terminal value multiples of 2006 EBITDA ranging from
8.0x to 13.0x, based on an analysis of the Sanmina comparable companies, Merrill
Lynch calculated the following implied equity values per share of Sanmina common
stock:

                                                            IMPLIED EQUITY VALUE PER SHARE OF

Sanmina Street Case (excluding expected synergies)........           $21.25 - $33.11

  Value of Expected Synergies

     Based upon the estimates provided by Sanmina management, Merrill Lynch
performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the synergies expected to result
from the merger. The discounted cash flow valuation was calculated assuming a
discount rate of 19% (the midpoint of the discounted cash flow analysis discount
rate range as discussed above) and was comprised of the sum of the present
values of (i) the projected after-tax

synergies expected to result from the merger, net of after tax costs incurred to
achieve the synergies expected to result from the merger, for the fiscal years
ending September 30, 2002 through 2006; and (ii) the terminal value of the
synergies expected to result from the merger, for the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2006, using a terminal value multiple of 10.5x (the midpoint of
the discounted cash flow analysis terminal multiple range as previously
discussed). Based upon this discounted cash flow analysis, Merrill Lynch valued
the synergies expected to result from the merger at $3.32 per share of SCI
common stock.

  Relative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

     Merrill Lynch utilized the SCI stand-alone discounted cash flow analysis
and the Sanmina stand-alone discounted cash flow analysis (both as described
above) to calculate the implied exchange ratio both before giving effect to the
synergies expected to result from the merger and after giving effect to the
present value to SCI of the synergies expected to result from the merger. The
analysis yielded the following range of implied exchange ratios:

  Relative Contribution Analysis

     Using publicly available actual results for the twelve months ending March
31, 2001 and using the Sanmina Management Case and the SCI Management Case for
the twelve-month periods ending June 30, 2001, September 30, 2001, June 30,
2002, and September 30, 2002, Merrill Lynch calculated the relative
contributions of Sanmina and SCI to historical and projected EBITDA and cash net
income of the pro forma combined entity both before and after giving effect to
the synergies expected to result from the merger to SCI. Based upon the analysis
Merrill Lynch calculated the following range of implied exchange ratios:

     Merrill Lynch also analyzed the relative contributions of Sanmina and SCI
to cash net income of the pro forma combined entity using publicly available
actual results for the twelve months ending March 31, 2001 and using First Call
estimates publicly available as of July 12, 2001 for the twelve-month periods
ending June 30, 2001, September 30, 2001, June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002,
Merrill Lynch calculated the relative contributions of Sanmina and SCI to cash
net income both before and after giving effect to the synergies expected to
result from the merger to SCI. Based upon the analysis Merrill Lynch calculated
the following range of implied exchange ratios:

  Pro Forma Combination Analysis

     Merrill Lynch analyzed the pro forma impact of the merger on Sanmina's cash
EPS for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002. Such analysis was based on
the Sanmina Management Case, the Sanmina Street

Case, the SCI Management Case, and the SCI Street Case, the merger agreement's
exchange ratio of 1.36x, and the synergies expected to result from the merger as
provided by management of Sanmina. The analysis indicated that the merger could
be accretive (excluding the income statement impact of merger-related costs) to
Sanmina's cash EPS for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002 after giving
effect to the synergies expected to result from the merger.

  Other Factors

     In preparing its opinion to the board of directors of Sanmina, Merrill
Lynch performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those
described above. The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses underlying the Merrill Lynch opinion or the
presentation made by Merrill Lynch to the board of directors of Sanmina. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving
various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Merrill
Lynch did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor
considered by it, but rather made qualitative judgments regarding the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, Merrill
Lynch believes its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting
only portions of its analyses and factors, or focusing on information presented
in tabular format, without considering all of the analyses and factors or the
narrative description of the analyses, could create an incomplete or misleading
view of the processes underlying its opinion.

     The board of directors of Sanmina selected Merrill Lynch to render a
fairness opinion because Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to
the merger. Merrill Lynch continually is engaged in the valuation of businesses
and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and for other
purposes and has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger.
Joseph M. Schell, chairman of global technology investment banking of Merrill
Lynch & Co., abstained from voting on the proposal to select Merrill Lynch as
Sanmina's financial advisor due to his relationship with Merrill Lynch.

     Sanmina has agreed to pay Merrill Lynch a customary fee for its services
and also agreed to reimburse Merrill Lynch for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of its legal counsel) incurred
in connection with its engagement as financial advisor. All of Merrill Lynch's
fee will be paid upon consummation of the merger. In addition, Sanmina has
agreed to indemnify Merrill Lynch and certain related persons against certain
liabilities arising out of or in conjunction with the services rendered by
Merrill Lynch under its engagement, including certain liabilities under federal
securities laws.

     In the ordinary course of business, Merrill Lynch may actively trade the
equity and debt securities of Sanmina and SCI for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities and loans.

OPINION OF GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

     On July 13, 2001, Goldman Sachs delivered its oral opinion to the board of
directors of SCI that as of the date of that opinion, the exchange ratio
pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the
holders of SCI common stock. Goldman Sachs subsequently confirmed its oral
opinion by delivery of its written opinion dated July 13, 2001.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS, DATED JULY 13, 2001,
WHICH SETS FORTH ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
REVIEW UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX C AND IS
INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. GOLDMAN SACHS PROVIDED ITS OPINION FOR THE
INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE OF SCI'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS
CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER. THE GOLDMAN SACHS OPINION IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION
AS TO HOW ANY HOLDER OF SCI COMMON STOCK SHOULD VOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE
TRANSACTION. WE URGE YOU TO READ THE OPINION IN ITS ENTIRETY.

     In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

     - the merger agreement;

     - Annual Reports to Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of SCI and
       Sanmina for the five fiscal years ended June 30, 2000 and September 30,
       2000, respectively;

     - certain Current Reports on Form 8-K of Sanmina, including such reports
       dated June 23, 2000 and September 5, 2000 regarding Sanmina's acquisition
       of Hadco Corporation and dated January 31, 2001 and May 14, 2001
       regarding Sanmina's acquisition of AB Segerstrom & Svensson;

     - certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form
       10-Q of SCI and Sanmina;

     - certain other communications from SCI and Sanmina to their respective
       stockholders;

     - certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Sanmina prepared by
       the management of Sanmina;

     - certain financial analyses and forecasts for Sanmina prepared by the
       management of SCI;

     - certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for SCI prepared by the
       management of SCI; and

     - certain cost savings and operating synergies projected by the management
       of SCI to result from the transaction contemplated by the merger
       agreement.

     Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management
of SCI and Sanmina regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for,
and the potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement, including their respective views of the importance of global scale in
the electronic manufacturing services industry, and the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of their
respective companies. In addition, Goldman Sachs:

     - reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the SCI common stock
       and the Sanmina common stock;

     - compared certain financial and stock market information for SCI and
       Sanmina with similar information for certain other companies the
       securities of which are publicly traded;

     - reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in
       the electronic manufacturing services industry specifically and in other
       industries generally; and

     - performed such other studies and analyses as Goldman Sachs considered
       appropriate.

     Goldman Sachs relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, accounting and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and
assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion. In
that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with the consent of SCI's board of
directors, that the internal financial analyses and forecasts for SCI prepared
by the management of SCI, the financial analyses and forecasts for Sanmina
prepared by the management of SCI and the cost savings and operating synergies
projected by the management of SCI to result from the proposed merger were
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates
and judgments of SCI and that such cost savings and operating synergies will be
realized in the amounts and time periods contemplated. In addition, Goldman
Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities of SCI or Sanmina or any of their respective subsidiaries and was
not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by
Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its opinion to SCI's board of
directors on July 13, 2001. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses
include information presented in tabular format. In order to more fully
understand the financial analyses used by Goldman Sachs, the tables must be read
together with the full text of each summary. The tables alone are not a complete
description of Goldman Sachs' financial analyses.

     (1) Exchange Ratio Analysis.  For selected time periods ending on July 12,
2001, Goldman Sachs calculated (i) the average ratio of the closing price of the
SCI common stock to the closing price of the Sanmina common stock, (ii) the
highest ratio of the closing price of the SCI common stock to the closing

price of the Sanmina common stock and (iii) the lowest ratio of the closing
price of the SCI common stock to the closing price of the Sanmina common stock.
In addition, with respect to each of the foregoing ratios, Goldman Sachs
calculated the implied premium being paid in the merger based on the exchange
ratio pursuant to the merger agreement of 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock
for each share of SCI common stock. The results of such analysis are set forth
below:

                              AVERAGE

     (2) Selected Companies Analysis.  Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared
certain financial information and public market multiples for SCI and Sanmina to
corresponding financial information and public market multiples for selected
publicly traded corporations in the electronic manufacturing services industry,
focusing particularly on the following large capitalization (market
capitalization greater than $3 billion as of July 12, 2001) companies:

     - Celestica, Inc.;

     - Flextronics International Ltd.;

     - Jabil Circuit, Inc.; and

     - Solectron Corporation.

     Goldman Sachs calculated the financial information and public market
multiples based on financial data as of July 12, 2001, information it obtained
from publicly available financial statements, and estimates from Goldman Sachs
Research, Institutional Brokers Estimate System (IBES) and other sources. With
respect to each of the selected companies, Goldman Sachs analyzed:

     - calendarized price-earnings ratio;

     - five-year compound annual growth rate of earnings per share; and

     - last-twelve-months' earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as a
       percentage of last-twelve-months' revenue.

     The results of these analyses are summarized below:

(d) Based on latest publicly available financial statements.

     (3) Premium Analysis.  Goldman Sachs analyzed the premiums paid in 97
transactions announced from March 1989 to December 2000 in which the target
stockholders' ownership of the combined company ranged from 30% to 50% and where
the combined company's pro forma market capitalization exceeded $1 billion one
day prior to announcement of the transaction. Goldman Sachs calculated the
premiums paid in such transactions based on the closing stock prices of the
target and acquiror on the last trading day prior to announcement of the
transaction. Goldman Sachs performed such analysis for purposes of comparison
with the 25% premium being paid to SCI stockholders in the proposed transaction
(based on the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement and the closing
prices of the SCI common stock and Sanmina common stock on July 12, 2001). Such
analysis indicated that:

     - the premium exceeded 25% in 21 of the selected transactions;

     - the premium exceeded 50% in 8 of the selected transactions;

     - the median premium for the selected transactions was 11.3%;

     - the mean premium for the selected transactions was 13.6%;

     - the lowest premium in the top quartile of the selected transactions in
       terms of premiums paid was 21.5%; and

     - the highest premium in the bottom quartile of the selected transactions
       in terms of premiums paid was 0.6%.

     (4) Contribution Analysis.  Goldman Sachs reviewed the cash net income of
SCI, Sanmina and the pro forma combined company resulting from the merger for
various time periods, and calculated the contribution each of SCI and Sanmina
would make to the cash net income of the pro forma combined company with respect
to each such period and the implied exchange ratio based on such relative
contributions, for purposes of comparison with the exchange ratio pursuant to
the merger agreement of 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock for each share of
SCI common stock. The results of such analysis are set forth below:

     Goldman Sachs also calculated the implied exchange ratio based on the
quarterly contribution of each of SCI and Sanmina to the earnings per share of
the combined company, based on estimates of earnings per share for SCI and
Sanmina by management of SCI and Sanmina, respectively, Goldman Sachs Research,
Merril Lynch Research and IBES, for purposes of comparison with the exchange
ratio pursuant to the merger agreement of 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock
for each share of SCI common stock. The results of such analysis are set forth

- ---------------

(a) Based on estimates and forecasts provided by management of SCI and Sanmina.

     (5) Incremental Cash Net Income Analysis.  Goldman Sachs analyzed the
fiscal year 2002 estimated cash net income for each of SCI, Sanmina and the pro
forma combined company, assuming $100 million of pre-tax synergies ($62 million
after-tax) (based on forecasts provided by SCI management) and based on
forecasts for SCI provided by management of SCI and forecasts for Sanmina
provided by management of Sanmina as well as SCI management's revision of the
forecasts for Sanmina provided by management of Sanmina. For each scenario,
Goldman Sachs calculated the amount of cash net income of the combined company
that could be considered to be attributable to the former SCI stockholders,
based on the former SCI stockholders' pro forma ownership of the combined
company. This analysis indicated that, under each scenario, the merger could be
accretive to the cash net income attributable to SCI's stockholders as compared
to SCI's standalone cash net income.

     (6) Accretion/Dilution Analysis.  Goldman Sachs analyzed the accretion or
dilution in earnings per share of the combined company (based on different
estimates of the standalone earnings per share of SCI and Sanmina) as compared
to the standalone estimated earnings per share of Sanmina. Goldman Sachs
performed such analysis assuming no synergies in the merger and assuming $100
million in pre-tax synergies ($62 million after-tax) (based on forecasts
provided by SCI management). The results of such analysis are set forth below:

(a) Forecasts for SCI provided by SCI management and forecasts for Sanmina
    provided by Sanmina management.

(b) Forecasts for SCI provided by SCI management; forecasts for Sanmina based on
    SCI management's revisions to forecasts provided by Sanmina management.

     (7) Value Creation/Dilution Analysis.  Goldman Sachs analyzed potential
value creation or dilution to the stockholders of SCI and Sanmina by comparing
the price of the SCI common stock and the Sanmina common stock (based on their
respective closing prices on July 12, 2001) with various estimates of the value
of the shares of Sanmina common stock to be held by such stockholders after
consummation of the proposed transaction. Goldman Sachs performed such analysis
based on (i) IBES, First Call, Goldman Sachs Research and Merrill Lynch Research
estimates of the earnings per share of SCI and Sanmina, and the pro forma
earnings per share of the combined company based on such estimates, in each case
for calendar year 2002, (ii) various assumptions with respect to the
price-earnings ratio at which the Sanmina common stock could trade after
consummation of the proposed transaction and (iii) the exchange ratio pursuant
to the merger agreement of 1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock for each share of
SCI common stock. Goldman Sachs performed such analysis assuming no synergies
would be achieved in the proposed transaction and assuming that $100 million in
pre-tax synergies ($62 million after-tax) (based on forecasts provided by SCI
management) would be achieved. Such analysis indicated that the proposed
transaction could be value accretive to SCI's stockholders in each of the
scenarios considered in such analysis, except the scenarios in which the
combined company's earnings per share are based on IBES or First Call estimates
and the common stock of the combined company trades in line with the
price-earnings ratio of the SCI common stock prior to the merger using the IBES
or First Call estimates, respectively.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Goldman Sachs considered the results of all such analyses. No company or
transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to
SCI or Sanmina or the contemplated transaction.

     The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing
its opinion to the SCI board of directors as to the fairness from a financial
point of view of the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. These
analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or
their respective advisors, none of SCI, Sanmina, Goldman Sachs or any other
person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from
those forecast.

     As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to the board of directors of SCI
was one of many factors taken into consideration by the SCI board of directors
in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing
summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed
by Goldman Sachs.

     Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Goldman Sachs is
familiar with SCI having provided certain investment banking services to SCI
from time to time, including having acted as its financial advisor in connection
with, and having participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the
merger agreement.

     SCI selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is a
nationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in
transactions similar to the merger.

     Goldman Sachs provides a full range of financial advisory and securities
services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to
time effect transactions and hold securities, including derivative securities,
of SCI or Sanmina for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

     Pursuant to a letter agreement dated May 1, 2001, SCI engaged Goldman Sachs
to act as its financial advisor in connection with the possible sale of all or a
portion of the company. Pursuant to the terms of this engagement letter, SCI has
agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a customary transaction fee.

     SCI has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including attorneys' fees, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs against
certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities
laws.

INTERESTS OF SCI DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS IN THE MERGER

     When considering the recommendation of SCI's board of directors, you should
be aware that the SCI directors and executive officers identified below have
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours.
The SCI board of directors was aware of these potential conflicts and considered
them in making its recommendation.

  Employment Agreements

     Sanmina and SCI have entered into an employment agreement with A. Eugene
Sapp, Jr., and have agreed to enter into an employment agreement with James E.
Moylan, Jr. which will become effective upon consummation of the merger. Sanmina
has agreed to enter into an employment agreement with Robert C. Bradshaw which
will become effective upon completion of the merger. See "AGREEMENTS RELATED TO
THE MERGER -- Employment Agreements" for a description of the material terms of
these employment agreements.

  Employee Severance Agreements

     Sanmina will enter into employee severance agreements with certain of SCI's
officers which will become effective upon completion of the merger. Each of the
agreements provides that in the event employment is terminated for any reason
other than cause or the employee voluntarily terminates his employment because
of the occurrence of certain events, the employee will be entitled to receive
severance payments equal to 1.5 times annual salary at the date of termination
and 1.5 times his average annualized bonus for the preceding two years. In
addition, in such event all outstanding stock options will fully vest on the
date of termination and will be required to be exercised within 90 days of such
date. See "AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE MERGER -- Employee Severance Agreements"
for a description of the material terms of the employee severance agreements.

  Director and Officer Indemnification

     SCI's directors and officers will receive, for a period of six years after
the completion of the merger, directors and officers insurance coverage with
terms substantially the same as SCI's existing directors and officers insurance
policy for events occurring on or prior to the completion of the merger through
one of the following mechanisms:

     - a directors and officers insurance policy whose annual premium is not
       greater than 125% of the premium of SCI's policy in effect on the date of
       the merger agreement; or

     - obtaining six-year "tail" coverage under SCI's existing directors and
       officers insurance policy.

  SCI Representative Directors

     Three representatives of SCI, A. Eugene Sapp, Jr., Wayne Shortridge and
Jackie M. Ward, will become members of Sanmina's board of directors when the
merger is completed. Sanmina also has agreed to place Messrs. Sapp's and
Shortridge's and Ms. Ward's names on its slate of nominees for the Sanmina board
of directors at the next three annual meetings of the Sanmina stockholders,
provided that the SCI representative's attendance at meetings of the Sanmina
board of directors for the prior year is at least equal to the average of the
attendance of all Sanmina directors for the same year. Each of these directors
who is not an employee of Sanmina or one of its subsidiaries will be entitled to
participate in the compensation and benefit

plans to the same extent as other nonemployee directors of Sanmina and will
become a party to an indemnification agreement with Sanmina that is
substantially similar to the indemnification agreements between Sanmina and its
nonemployee directors who were not formerly directors of SCI.

  Assumption of SCI Stock Options

     In connection with the merger, Sanmina will assume any outstanding options
to purchase SCI common stock and those options will be converted to options to
purchase Sanmina common stock. Each stock option which is assumed will continue
to have the same terms and conditions which applied prior to consummation of the
merger except that each option will be exercisable for the number of whole
shares of Sanmina common stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
SCI common stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately
prior to completion of the merger multiplied by the exchange ratio of 1.36,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, and the per share exercise price will
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
SCI common stock at which such option was exercisable immediately prior to
completion of the merger by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. As of [               ], 2001, the directors and officers of SCI held
options to purchase [     ] shares of SCI common stock which are vested or will
become vested within 60 days of that date. The exercise period of the options
held by certain SCI officers will, pursuant to their employment agreements, be
extended in certain circumstances. The remaining options held by the officers
and directors of SCI will continue to vest on their original schedules.

EXCHANGE OF SCI STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR SANMINA STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Following the completion of the merger, Sanmina's exchange agent will mail
to SCI stockholders a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering
SCI stock certificates in exchange for Sanmina stock certificates. When SCI
stockholders deliver their SCI stock certificates to the exchange agent along
with an executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, their
SCI stock certificates will be canceled and they will receive Sanmina stock
certificates representing the number of full shares of Sanmina common stock to
which they are entitled under the merger agreement. SCI stockholders will not
receive any fractional shares of Sanmina common stock in the merger, but will
instead receive cash equal to their proportionate interest of the aggregate
fractional shares. In this case, the market value of the fractional shares will
be based on the average closing price of Sanmina common stock for the five
trading days ending immediately preceding the trading day on which the
effectiveness of the merger occurs.

SCI STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT THEIR SCI STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR EXCHANGE
UNTIL THEY RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS AND A FORM OF LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM THE
EXCHANGE AGENT.

     SCI stockholders are not entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions on Sanmina common stock until the merger is completed and they
have surrendered their SCI stock certificates in exchange for Sanmina stock
certificates. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, SCI stockholders will
receive payment for any dividend or other distribution on Sanmina common stock
with a record date after the merger and a payment date prior to the date SCI
stockholders surrender their stock certificates after Sanmina stock certificates
are issued. SCI stockholders will receive payment for any dividend or other
distribution on Sanmina common stock with a record date after the merger and a
payment date after the date SCI stockholders surrender their stock certificates
following the payment date.

     Sanmina will only issue a Sanmina stock certificate or a check in lieu of a
fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered SCI stock
certificate is registered if the SCI stockholder presents the exchange agent all
documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and
show payment of any applicable stock transfer taxes. Any SCI stockholder that
has a stock certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, may be required
to deliver an affidavit and bond prior to receiving Sanmina stock certificate.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER

     In the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, counsel to Sanmina, and Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy LLP,
counsel to SCI, the following are the material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger, assuming that the merger is effected as described in
the merger agreement and this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This opinion and
the following discussion are based on currently existing provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing Treasury Regulations
thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which
are subject to change. Any such change, which may or may not be retroactive,
could alter the tax consequences to Sanmina, SCI or SCI stockholders as
described herein. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, is referred to
as the "Code."

     The discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations
that may be relevant to particular SCI stockholders in light of their particular
circumstances. The discussion assumes that the SCI stockholders hold their
shares of SCI common stock as capital assets (generally for investment). In
addition, the following discussion does not address the tax consequences of the
merger under foreign, state or local tax laws or the tax consequences of
transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to or concurrently with the merger
(whether or not such transactions are in connection with the merger), including,
without limitation, transactions in which SCI common stock is acquired or
Sanmina common stock is disposed of.

     ACCORDINGLY, SCI STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS
AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER IN
THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

     Consummation of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt by Sanmina and
SCI of tax opinions from their respective counsel that the merger will be
treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
The tax opinions will be subject to certain assumptions, limitations and
qualifications, and are based upon the truth and accuracy of certain factual
representations of Sanmina, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc. and SCI.

     Provided that the merger qualifies as a reorganization, subject to the
assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein:

     - Holders of SCI common stock will recognize no gain or loss upon the
       receipt of Sanmina common stock solely in exchange for their SCI common
       stock in the merger, except with respect to cash received in lieu of
       fractional shares of Sanmina common stock.

     - The aggregate tax basis of the Sanmina common stock received by the SCI
       stockholders in the merger will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of
       the SCI common stock surrendered in exchange therefor (reduced by any
       basis allocable to fractional shares for which cash is received).

     - The holding period of the Sanmina common stock received by each SCI
       stockholder in the merger will include the holding period of the SCI
       common stock surrendered in exchange therefor.

     - A holder of SCI common stock receiving cash in the merger in lieu of a
       fractional interest in Sanmina common stock will be treated as if such
       holder actually received such fractional share interest which was
       subsequently redeemed by Sanmina. An SCI stockholder should recognize
       gain or loss with respect to a cash payment in lieu of a fractional share
       measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received
       and the basis in such fractional share.

     - None of Sanmina, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary or SCI will recognize gain or
       loss solely as a result of the merger.

     No ruling has been or will be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service in
connection with the merger. SCI stockholders should be aware that the tax
opinions do not bind the Internal Revenue Service and that the Internal Revenue
Service is therefore not precluded from asserting a contrary opinion. The tax
opinions are also subject to certain assumptions and qualifications and will be
based on the truth and accuracy of certain

representations made by Sanmina, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary and SCI, including,
without limitation, representations in certificates to be delivered to counsel
by the respective management of Sanmina, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary and SCI.

     A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the reorganization
status of the merger would result in SCI stockholders recognizing taxable
capital gain or loss with respect to each share of SCI common stock surrendered
equal to the difference between the SCI stockholder's tax basis in such share
and the fair market value, as of the closing of the merger, of the Sanmina
common stock and any other consideration received in exchange therefor. In such
event, an SCI stockholder's aggregate basis in the Sanmina common stock so
received would equal its fair market value as of the closing of the merger and
the holding period for such stock would begin the day after the closing of the
merger. However, even in that event, neither Sanmina, Sun Acquisition Subsidiary
nor SCI would recognize gain or loss solely as a result of the merger.

     Certain noncorporate SCI stockholders may be subject to backup withholding
at a rate of 30.5% on cash payments received in the merger. Backup withholding
will not apply, however, to a stockholder who furnishes a correct taxpayer
identification number and certifies that he or she is not subject to backup
withholding on the substitute Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal,
who provides a certificate of foreign status on an appropriate Form W-8, or who
is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. A stockholder who fails to provide
the correct taxpayer identification number on Form W-9 may be subject to a $50
penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service.

     THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED ONLY AS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN UNITED
STATES INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A
COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX EFFECTS RELEVANT THERETO.
THUS, SCI STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE
SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING TAX RETURN REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS, THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF NON-U.S., FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL,
AND OTHER APPLICABLE TAX LAWS AND THE EFFECT OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE TAX
LAWS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination for
financial accounting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. For purposes of preparing Sanmina's consolidated
financial statements, Sanmina will establish a new accounting basis for SCI's
assets and liabilities based upon their fair values, the merger consideration
and the costs of the merger. Sanmina believes that any excess of cost over the
fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of SCI will be
recorded as goodwill. Pursuant to Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, "Business Combinations" and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets," goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization over its estimated
useful life. Rather, goodwill will be subject to at least annual assessment for
impairment based on a fair value test. Identified intangible assets with finite
lives will be amortized over those lives. A final determination of the
intangible asset values and required purchase accounting adjustments, including
the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their respective fair values, has not yet been made. Sanmina
will determine the fair value of SCI's assets and liabilities and will make
appropriate business combination accounting adjustments. However, for purposes
of disclosing pro forma information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
Sanmina has made a preliminary determination of the purchase price allocation,
based upon current estimates and assumptions, which is subject to revision upon
consummation of the merger.

REGULATORY FILINGS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

     U.S. Antitrust.  This merger is subject to review by the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether it is in
compliance with applicable antitrust laws. Under the provisions of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the merger may
not be consummated until the specified waiting period requirements of that act
have been satisfied. Sanmina and SCI

filed notification reports, together with requests for early termination of the
waiting period, with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

     European Union.  Both Sanmina and SCI conduct business in member states of
the European Union. European Union Council Regulation No. 4064/89 and
accompanying regulations require notification of and approval by the European
Commission of specific mergers or acquisitions involving parties with aggregate
worldwide sales and individual European Union sales exceeding specified
thresholds before these mergers and acquisitions can be implemented. Sanmina and
SCI intend to file formal notifications with the European Commission. Completing
a review and gaining approval under the European Commission merger regulation is
a condition to completing the merger.

     Canada.  Both Sanmina and SCI conduct business in Canada. The Competition
Act of Canada and accompanying regulations require notification to and approval
by Canada's Competition Bureau of specific mergers or acquisitions involving
parties whose aggregate Canadian assets or whose revenues from sales to and from
Canada exceed a predetermined threshold, or if the amount of the Canadian assets
being acquired exceeds a specific dollar value. This notification to the
Competition Bureau and expiration of the applicable waiting period are required
before the merger can be completed.

     Sanmina and SCI also have filed a premerger notification form with the
antitrust agency in Brazil and may be required to file a premerger notification
form with the antitrust agency in Mexico, and possibly with the antitrust
agencies in other jurisdictions in which Sanmina and SCI conduct their
businesses.

     Stock Exchanges.  The completion of this merger is subject to compliance
with the rules of the Nasdaq National Market System and the New York Stock
Exchange.

     Third-party Approvals.  SCI is a party to a number of loan agreements,
lease agreements and other agreements. Pursuant to the merger agreement, SCI has
agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, approvals
and waivers from third parties.

     Rights Plan.  In December 2000, SCI's board of directors adopted a
stockholders' rights agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the rights agreement,
each right entitles the holder to purchase a share of SCI common stock at a
specified exercise price. The rights agreement further provides that no right is
exercisable until the occurrence of certain events.

     On July 13, 2001, prior to approving the merger agreement, SCI's board of
directors amended the rights agreement to render it inapplicable to the merger
and related transaction described herein.

CERTAIN SECURITIES LAWS CONSIDERATIONS

     The shares of Sanmina common stock to be issued in the merger will be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These shares will be
freely transferable under the Securities Act, except for Sanmina common stock
issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of SCI. Persons who may be
deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with SCI and may include SCI's
officers and directors, as well as its principal stockholders. SCI's affiliates
may not sell their Sanmina common stock acquired in the merger except pursuant
to:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 promulgated by the
       Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act; or

     - any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     In accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, there will be no
appraisal rights or dissenters' rights available to holders of SCI common stock
in connection with the merger.

LISTING ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET SYSTEM OF SANMINA COMMON STOCK TO BE
ISSUED IN THE MERGER

     Sanmina has agreed to cause the shares of Sanmina common stock to be issued
and to be reserved for issuance in connection with the merger to be approved for
listing on the Nasdaq National Market System, subject to official notice of
issuance.

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF SCI COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     If the merger is completed, SCI's common stock will be delisted from the
New York Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. As a result of the merger, SCI's 3% convertible
subordinated notes may not qualify for continued listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the merger
agreement. While Sanmina and SCI believe that the description covers the
material terms of the merger agreement, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. The merger agreement is attached to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, and Sanmina and SCI urge you to
read it carefully.

GENERAL

     Following the adoption of the merger agreement, the approval of the merger,
the issuance of shares of Sanmina common stock to SCI stockholders in connection
with the merger and the change Sanmina's corporate name to [               ],
and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the merger, Sun
Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina, will merge
with and into SCI. SCI will survive the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Sanmina. If all conditions to the merger are satisfied or waived, the merger
will become effective at the time of the filing of certificate of merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

THE EXCHANGE RATIO AND TREATMENT OF SCI COMMON STOCK

     At the effective time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of
SCI common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.36 shares of
Sanmina common stock. However, any shares owned by SCI, Sanmina or any of their
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries will be cancelled without
conversion. Sanmina will adjust the exchange ratio to reflect any stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
similar change with respect to Sanmina common stock or SCI common stock
occurring before the effective time of the merger.

     Based on the exchange ratio of 1.36, and based on the number of shares of
SCI common stock and options to purchase SCI common stock outstanding as of
[               ], 2001, a total of approximately [     ] shares of Sanmina
common stock and options to purchase Sanmina common stock will be issued or
granted in the merger.

TREATMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK OF SCI

     Any shares of SCI capital stock outstanding at the effective time of the
merger which are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any restricted stock purchase agreement or other arrangements
will be converted into unvested shares of Sanmina common stock based on the
exchange ratio and will remain subject to the same terms, restrictions and
vesting schedules as were applicable prior to the effective time of the merger.
Sanmina will assume any rights SCI held prior to the effective time of the
merger to repurchase these unvested shares.

TREATMENT OF SCI STOCK OPTIONS

     At the effective time of the merger, Sanmina will assume all outstanding
options, whether vested or unvested, to purchase shares of SCI common stock and
convert them into options to purchase Sanmina common stock subject to the same
terms and conditions as were applicable prior to the effective time of the
merger, including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting
provisions. The number of shares of Sanmina common stock issuable upon the
exercise of these stock options will be adjusted based on the exchange ratio.
Any fractional share of Sanmina common stock resulting from such adjustment will
be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share of
Sanmina common stock issuable under each assumed SCI option will equal the
exercise price per share of the SCI common stock purchasable under the SCI
option divided by the exchange ratio. The exercise price will be rounded up to
the nearest whole cent.

     Sanmina will reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of its
common stock for delivery upon an SCI optionholder's exercise of his or her
option. Sanmina has agreed that within 10 business days of the

closing of the merger, Sanmina will file a registration statement on Form S-8
covering the shares of Sanmina common stock issuable with respect to assumed SCI
stock options.

     The exercise period for options held by certain SCI officers may, pursuant
to their employment agreements, be extended in certain circumstances following
the merger.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     Exchange Agent; Exchange Procedures; No Further Ownership Rights.  After
the effective time of the merger, Sanmina's exchange agent will mail a letter of
transmittal and instructions for surrendering SCI certificates to each record
holder of SCI common stock. Only those holders who properly surrender their
certificates in accordance with the instructions will receive certificates
representing Sanmina common stock, cash in lieu of any fractional Sanmina common
stock and any dividends or distributions to which they are entitled. The
surrendered certificates representing shares of SCI common stock will be
cancelled. After the effective time of the merger, each certificate representing
shares of SCI common stock that have not been surrendered will only represent:

     - the number of whole shares of common stock of Sanmina into which such
       shares have been converted;

     - the right to receive cash in lieu of any fractional share of Sanmina
       common stock; and

     - any dividends or distributions that may be applicable.

Following the closing of the merger, SCI will not register any transfers of SCI
common stock on its stock transfer books.

     No Fractional Shares.  Sanmina will not issue any fractional shares of
common stock in the merger. Instead, each holder of shares of SCI common stock
exchanged in the merger who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of common stock of Sanmina will receive cash, without interest, equal to
such fraction multiplied by the average closing price per share of Sanmina
common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the five trading days immediately
preceding the trading day on which the effective time of the merger occurs.

     Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  After the effective date
of the merger, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
closing of the merger with respect to Sanmina common stock will be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered SCI certificate until the holder surrenders his or
her SCI certificate in accordance with the letter of transmittal.

     Lost Certificates.  If any SCI common stock certificate is lost, stolen or
destroyed, an SCI stockholder must provide an appropriate affidavit certifying
that fact to Sanmina's exchange agent. Sanmina or its exchange agent may require
an SCI stockholder to deliver a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Sanmina or its exchange agent with respect to any lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate.

     HOLDERS OF SCI COMMON STOCK SHOULD NOT SEND IN THEIR CERTIFICATES UNTIL
THEY RECEIVE A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM SANMINA'S EXCHANGE AGENT.

complicated and not easily summarized. You are urged to carefully read the
articles of the merger agreement entitled "Representations and Warranties of
Company," relating to SCI and "Representations and Warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub," relating to Sanmina and Sun Acquisition Subsidiary.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BEFORE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     Sanmina and SCI agreed that, until the earlier of the completion of the
merger or termination of the merger agreement or unless the other company
consents in writing, each company will conduct its business in all material
respects in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice, pay its debts
and taxes when due,

and pay or perform material obligations and use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with past practices and policies to:

     - preserve intact its present business organization;

     - keep available the services of its present officers and employees; and

     - preserve its relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors,
       licensors, licensees and others with which it has business dealings.

     Sanmina and SCI also agreed to promptly notify the other company of any
material event involving each company's respective business or operations.

     Sanmina and SCI also agreed that until the earlier of the completion of the

       "reorganization" under the Internal Revenue Code.

     Sanmina and SCI also agreed to change Sanmina's corporate name effective
upon the consummation of the merger and Sanmina agreed to submit the name change
to its stockholders for approval.

     The agreements related to the conduct of SCI's and Sanmina's businesses in
the merger agreement are complicated and not easily summarized. You are urged to
carefully read the section of the merger agreement entitled "-- Conduct Prior to
the Effective Time".

NO SOLICITATION BY SCI

     SCI further agreed to cease, as of the date of the merger agreement, any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted prior to that date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined below) and request that all confidential information provided to any
such party be returned.

     An "Acquisition Proposal" is any inquiry, offer or proposal relating to any
Acquisition Transaction, other than an offer or proposal by Sanmina.

     An "Acquisition Transaction" is any transaction or series of related
transactions, other than the merger of Sanmina and SCI, involving any of the
following:

     - the acquisition or purchase from SCI of more than a 15% interest in the
       total outstanding voting securities of SCI or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
       any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of the total
       outstanding voting securities of SCI or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving SCI pursuant to which the SCI stockholders immediately
       preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in
       the surviving or resulting entity;

     - any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
       transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, acquisition or
       disposition of more than 50% of the assets of SCI; or

     - any liquidation or dissolution of SCI.

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, SCI
and its subsidiaries agreed not to directly or indirectly take any of the
following actions:

     - solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly induce the making, submission
       or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal;

     - participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
       any person any non-public information with respect to any Acquisition
       Proposal;

     - take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
       proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any
       Acquisition Proposal;

     - subject to limited exceptions, approve, endorse or recommend any
       Acquisition Proposal; or

     - enter into any letter of intent or similar agreement or any contract,
       agreement or commitment contemplating or relating to any Acquisition
       Transaction.

     SCI's board of directors may, without breaching the merger agreement,
respond to an unsolicited, bona fide written Superior Proposal (as defined
below) by discussing the proposal with the party making the proposal, furnishing
information to the party making the proposal, recommending a Superior Proposal
to SCI stockholders or withdrawing its recommendation of the merger agreement
with Sanmina, if all of the following conditions are met:

     - SCI and its subsidiaries have not violated the restrictions set forth
       above regarding Acquisition Proposals and Acquisition Transactions;

     - SCI's board determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside
       legal counsel, that not recommending the Superior Proposal would result
       in a reasonable likelihood that SCI's board will not fulfill its
       fiduciary obligations to SCI stockholders under Delaware law;

     - SCI receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement;

     - SCI gives prior written notice to Sanmina of the identity of the party
       making the proposal and of any discussions or negotiations with, or the
       furnishing of information to, the party making the proposal; and

     - when furnishing nonpublic information to the party making the proposal,
       SCI contemporaneously furnishes the same information to Sanmina, to the
       extent it has not already been received by Sanmina, or complies with
       Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, if applicable.

     For purposes of the foregoing, any action by any officer, director or
affiliate of SCI or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney
or auditor of SCI or any of its subsidiaries is deemed to be an action by SCI.

     A "Superior Proposal" is an unsolicited, bona fide offer made by a third
party to consummate any of:

     - a sale or other disposition by SCI of all or substantially all of its
       assets; or

     - the acquisition by any person or group, including by way of merger,
       tender offer or exchange offer or issuance by SCI, directly or
       indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
       ownership of shares representing a majority of the then outstanding
       voting power of SCI.

     In addition, to qualify as a Superior Proposal, SCI's board of directors
must determine in its good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor):

     - that the offer is more favorable to SCI stockholders than the merger with
       Sanmina; and

     - that any financing required by the offering party has already been
       committed or in the reasonable judgment of its financial advisor is
       likely to be obtained on a timely basis.

     SCI has agreed to promptly inform Sanmina of any request for information
that SCI reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to which SCI reasonably
believes would lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of
the person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.
SCI further agreed to keep Sanmina informed in all material respects of the
status and details, including material amendments or proposed amendments, of any
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and to provide Sanmina with
advance notice of any meeting of the SCI board of directors at which the board
of directors is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal or
recommend a Superior Offer to SCI stockholders.

SCI STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

     SCI is obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the SCI
special meeting of stockholders for purposes of voting for approval and adoption
of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. Unless SCI's board of
directors withdraws its recommendations and recommends a Superior Offer, SCI's
board of directors will continue to recommend that SCI stockholders vote in
favor of approval and adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger.

SANMINA STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

     Sanmina is obligated under the merger agreement to hold and convene the
Sanmina special meeting of stockholders for purposes of voting for the approval
of the issuance of shares of Sanmina common stock in the merger and the change
of Sanmina's corporate name. Sanmina's board of directors will recommend that
Sanmina's stockholders vote in favor of these proposals in connection with the
merger.

SANMINA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AFTER THE TRANSACTION

     Sanmina has agreed to amend its bylaws at the effective time of the
transaction to increase the size of its board of directors from seven to ten
persons and to appoint three representatives of SCI to fill these vacancies.
Sanmina also agreed to nominate these SCI representatives for election to
Sanmina's board of directors at Sanmina's annual meetings in 2002, 2003 and 2004
provided that the SCI representative's attendance for the prior year is at least
equal to the average of the attendance of all Sanmina directors for the same
year. The SCI representatives will be A. Eugene Sapp, Jr., Wayne Shortridge, and
Jackie M. Ward.

or Sanmina rights plans, as the case may be, not applicable to the merger.

inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that is, or would reasonably be expected to
be, materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets),
capitalization, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of such
entity and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. However, under the terms of the

       United States economy or the world economy;

     - a change that primarily results from conditions generally affecting the
       electronics manufacturing services industry;

       provisions in contracts and agreements between SCI and its principal
       customers;

     - a change that results from the announcement and the pendency of the
       merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby; or

     - a change that results directly from action taken by a party in connection
       with fulfilling its obligations under the merger agreement.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to completion of
the merger, whether before or after adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the merger by the SCI stockholders and the Sanmina stockholders:

     - by mutual written consent of the boards of directors of Sanmina and SCI;

     - by Sanmina or SCI, if the merger is not completed before December 31,
       2001, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement is not
       available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a
       principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on
       or before December 31, 2001, and this action or failure to act
       constitutes a material breach of the merger agreement;

     - by Sanmina or SCI, if there is any order, decree or ruling of a court or
       governmental authority having jurisdiction over either Sanmina or SCI
       permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
       completion of the merger;

     - by Sanmina or SCI, if the SCI stockholders fail to adopt the merger
       agreement and approve the merger at the SCI stockholders' meeting, or if
       the Sanmina stockholders fail to approve the stockholder proposals at the
       Sanmina stockholders' meeting, except that this right is not available to
       any party whose action or failure to act has been the principal cause of
       or resulted in the failure to receive the stockholder vote and such
       action or failure constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

     - by SCI concurrently with the execution by SCI of a definitive agreement
       relating to an Acquisition Transaction;

     - by SCI, upon Sanmina's breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
       or agreement in the merger agreement, or if any of Sanmina's
       representations or warranties become untrue in either case so that the
       corresponding condition to completion of the merger would not be met.
       However, if the breach or inaccuracy is curable by Sanmina, SCI may not
       terminate the merger agreement until 30 days after delivery of written
       notice so long as Sanmina exercises commercially reasonable efforts to
       cure the breach and the breach is not cured during this 30 days;

     - by Sanmina, upon SCI's breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
       or agreement in the merger agreement, or if any of SCI's representations
       or warranties become untrue, in either case so that the corresponding
       condition to completion of the merger would not be met. However, if the
       breach or inaccuracy is curable by SCI, Sanmina may not terminate the
       merger agreement until 30 days after delivery of written notice so long
       as SCI exercises commercially reasonable efforts to cure the breach and
       the breach is not cured during this 30 days; or

     - by Sanmina if any of the following shall have occurred:

      - SCI's board of directors withdraws, amends or modifies its
        recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger in a manner adverse
        to Sanmina, or SCI's board of directors resolves to do so;

        SCI's board of directors resolves to do so; or

      - SCI's board of directors fails to send its stockholders a recommendation
        to reject any tender or exchange offer within 10 days.

PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE BY SCI

     SCI will pay Sanmina a termination fee of $30.0 million if SCI terminates
the merger agreement and enters into a definitive agreement relating to a Change
of Control Transaction (as defined below) and an additional $120.0 million if
SCI consummates this or any other Change of Control Transaction within 15 months
after termination of the merger agreement.

     SCI will pay Sanmina a termination fee of $150.0 million if Sanmina
terminates the merger agreement and SCI consummates a Change of Control
Transaction within 15 months of any of the following:

       of the merger agreement or the merger in a manner adverse to Sanmina, or
       resolves to do so;

     - SCI's board of directors fails to send its stockholders a recommendation
       to reject any tender or exchange offer within 10 days.

     For purposes of this section, a "Change of Control Transaction" is any
transaction or series of related transactions, other than the merger of Sanmina
and SCI, involving any of the following:

     - the acquisition or purchase from SCI of more than a 50% interest in the
       total outstanding voting securities of SCI or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
       any person or group beneficially owning 50% or more of the total
       outstanding voting securities of SCI or any of its subsidiaries;

     - any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction
       involving SCI pursuant to which the SCI stockholders immediately
       preceding such transaction hold less than 50% of the equity interests in
       the surviving or resulting entity;

     - any sale, lease outside the ordinary course of business, exchange,
       transfer, license outside the ordinary course of business, acquisition or
       disposition of more than 50% of the assets of SCI; or

     - any liquidation or dissolution of SCI.

     SCI will pay Sanmina $3.0 million for its expenses if the merger agreement
is terminated because the SCI stockholders do not approve and adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger, as long as the Sanmina stockholders approve
the share issuance and the change of Sanmina's corporate name. If SCI is
required to pay both the $30.0 million fee and the $3.0 million fee, payment of
the $3.0 million fee will be credited against the $30.0 million fee.

     Sanmina will pay SCI a $3.0 million fee if the merger agreement is
terminated because the Sanmina stockholders do not approve the share issuance
and the change of Sanmina's corporate name, as long as the SCI stockholders have
adopted the merger agreement and approved the merger and the merger agreement is
not otherwise terminable by Sanmina for other specified reasons.

AFTER THE MERGER

     Following the merger, SCI will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanmina. The
stockholders of SCI will become stockholders of Sanmina, and their rights as
stockholders will be governed by the Sanmina certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, as currently in effect, and the laws of Delaware. See "COMPARISON OF
RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SCI COMMON STOCK AND SANMINA COMMON STOCK" on page 95 of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Exchange and the Nasdaq National Market System, Sanmina and SCI may amend the
merger agreement before completion of the merger by mutual written consent. In
addition, either Sanmina or SCI may extend the other's time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts under the merger agreement, waive any
inaccuracies in the other's representations and warranties and waive compliance
by the other with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger
agreement.

     - a change of more than 25 miles in the location of his office;

     - a substantial change in his position or duties from those held by him
       prior to the completion of the merger; or

     - a failure by SCI or Sanmina to comply with certain of its obligations
       under the employment agreement,

then he will also be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment in cash

representatives will be entitled to receive the $200,000 lump sum severance
payment described above. In addition, his family will be entitled to receive the

options will be required to be exercised within a specified period of the date
of termination.

     Mr. Moylan will also be entitled to receive as a result of the termination
of his employment by reason of his disability an amount equal to the $200,000

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS

     SCI intends to enter into severance agreements, effective upon completion
of the merger, with twenty-one of its other officers. The severance agreements
will provide for certain payments to these officers in the event that their
employment with SCI is terminated within a specified period of the effective
date of the merger.

     All of the severance agreements contain substantially similar terms and
provide that if the officer's employment is terminated for any reason, the
officer or his or her legal representatives will be entitled to receive the
officer's base salary through the date of termination, any unpaid deferred
compensation and accrued vacation pay, benefits owed under the employee benefit
plans and policies and reimbursement for expenses incurred prior to the date of
termination.

     Under the severance agreements, if the officer's employment is terminated
other than for cause, disability, death or retirement or the officer voluntarily
terminates employment because any of the following events occur without his or
her consent:

     - a reduction in base salary or annual target bonus opportunity;

     - a change of more than 25 miles in the location of his or her office;

     - a substantial change in the officer's position or duties from those held
       by the officer prior to the completion of the merger;

     - the failure by SCI to provide the officer with participation in any of
       the benefit programs that the officer was participating in prior to the
       merger;

     - the failure of SCI to provide the officer with prompt reimbursement for
       reasonable business expenses, or to provide paid vacation or employee
       benefits; or

     - a failure by SCI or Sanmina to comply with certain of its obligations
       under the employment agreement;

and the officer signs and does not revoke a standard release of
employment-related claims, then the officer shall also be entitled to receive a
lump sum severance payment in cash equal to

     - one and one-half times the average of the officer's annualized bonus
       payable for the two most recently completed fiscal years; and

     - an amount equal to one and one-half times the officer's base salary at
       the date of termination.

     In addition, the officer, his or her spouse and eligible dependents will be
entitled to the continuation of certain health and welfare benefits for 18
months after the termination date or, alternatively, may elect to receive a cash
payment equal to 1.5 times SCI's cost to provide such benefits; and as of the
date of termination, all of the officer's outstanding equity based awards will
become vested and all vested stock options will be required to be exercised
within 90 days of the date of termination, or such longer post-termination
exercise period applicable to such option.

     If the officer's employment is terminated by reason of his or her death,
the officer's family will be entitled to receive the benefits generally
available to surviving families of Sanmina executives with comparable
responsibilities or positions, and as of the date of termination, all of the
officer's outstanding equity based award will become vested and all vested stock
options will be required to be exercised within 90 days of the date of
termination, or such longer post-termination exercise period applicable to such
option.

     If the officer's employment is terminated by reason of his or her
disability, the officer's family will be entitled to continue to participate
under all health and welfare programs for the period ending on the earlier to
occur of the executive's 65th birthday or 18 months from the date of the
officer's termination of employment.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
give effect to the proposed merger of Sanmina and SCI using the purchase method
of accounting, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
141, "Business Combinations." Under this method of accounting, Sanmina will
allocate the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired, including
identified intangible assets and goodwill. The purchase price allocation is
subject to revision when Sanmina obtains additional information regarding asset
valuation. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are
based on the respective historical consolidated financial statements and the
accompanying notes of Sanmina and SCI, which are incorporated by reference in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed balance sheet assumes the merger took place on June 30, 2001, and
combines Sanmina's June 30, 2001, unaudited consolidated balance sheet with
SCI's March 25, 2001, unaudited consolidated balance sheet. The unaudited pro
forma combined statements of operations assume that the merger took place on
October 3, 1999. Sanmina's unaudited consolidated statement of operations for
the nine months ended June 30, 2001, has been combined with SCI's unaudited
consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended March 25, 2001.
Sanmina's audited statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2000
has been combined with SCI's audited statement of income for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of
operations for the annual period does not present like periods. The use of
different closing dates is necessary as each entity has different fiscal year
ends. The pro forma reporting with respect to combining Sanmina and SCI's
results with different fiscal year ends that are within 93 days and is in
accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance. The periods
combined for purposes of presenting the unaudited pro forma combined statements
of operations are not necessarily indicative of the periods expected to be
combined after the date of the closing of the merger. The unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial statements are based on the estimates and
assumptions set forth in the notes to these statements. The pro forma
adjustments made in connection with the development of the pro forma information
are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing such pro
forma information for illustrative purposes necessary to comply with the
disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited
pro forma combined condensed financial statements do not purport to be
indicative of the results of operations for future periods or the combined
financial position or the results that actually would have been realized had the
entities been a single entity during these periods. Sanmina and SCI estimate
that they will incur direct transaction costs of approximately $18.5 million and
$26.8 million, respectively, associated with the merger. Such costs of Sanmina
will be included in the total purchase cost for accounting purposes and are
considered in the pro forma adjustments. Such costs of SCI will be charged to
operations by SCI in the fiscal quarter in which the merger is consummated.
There can be no assurance that the combined company will not incur additional
charges in subsequent quarters reflecting costs associated with the merger.

     These unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and
the related notes thereto of Sanmina and SCI which are incorporated by reference
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

                     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED
                         CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     On July 16, 2001, Sanmina announced that it had entered into a definitive
merger agreement with SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI"). Under the terms of the
agreement, each outstanding share of SCI common stock will be converted into
1.36 shares of Sanmina common stock. In addition, Sanmina will issue options to
purchase shares of Sanmina common stock in exchange for each issued and
outstanding SCI option, using the ratio of 1.36 shares of Sanmina for each share
of SCI.

     The merger will be accounted for as a business combination under the
purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price will be allocated
to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on
the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date. The assumed
total purchase price for SCI used in the pro forma combined condensed financial
statements is an initial estimate of the purchase price and is subject to
change. Additionally, the purchase price allocation is based upon a preliminary
valuation which could change when finalized upon closing the acquisition, based
upon the facts and circumstances at that time. A change in the purchase price or
the allocation of the purchase price would affect the value assigned to the
tangible and intangible assets and therefore could have a material effect on
actual future results of Sanmina. The amounts and components of the estimated
purchase price along with the preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase
price are presented below:

PURCHASE PRICE

                                                              (IN THOUSANDS)

Fair value of Sanmina common stock to be issued.............    $4,145,267
Fair value of SCI options to be assumed.....................       223,466
Estimated transaction costs of Sanmina......................        18,500
                                                                ----------
          Total purchase price..............................    $4,387,233
                                                                ==========

     The assumed total purchase price of approximately $4.4 billion consists of
approximately 198.6 million shares of Sanmina common stock with an estimated
fair value of $4.1 billion, 13.1 million stock options with an estimated fair
value, of $223.5 million, and estimated direct transaction costs of Sanmina of
approximately $18.5 million. The 198.6 million shares of Sanmina common stock to
be issued is based upon 146,018,515 shares of SCI common stock outstanding at
July 13, 2001 at the exchange ratio of 1.36. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial statements were prepared assuming a market value of Sanmina
common stock of $20.87. The fair value of Sanmina common stock was determined as
the average closing market price for the five trading days ending July 17, 2001.
The fair value of the SCI common stock options to be assumed was estimated using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 4.48%, expected life of four years,
expected dividend rate of 0% and volatility of 105%. Estimated direct
transaction costs of Sanmina consist primarily of fees for investment bankers,
attorneys, and accountants, filing fees, and financial printing.

     The total purchase price is expected to be allocated to tangible assets and
liabilities, identifiable intangible assets, goodwill and deferred compensation.
A valuation of intangible assets and fixed assets is being conducted and is
expected to be completed at or prior to closing. In addition, it is expected
that following the merger, the combined company will incur restructuring costs,
including employee separations and elimination of duplicate facilities, which
cannot be currently estimated. Such costs with respect to SCI operations will be
accounted for as additional purchase cost. Such costs with respect to Sanmina
operations will be accounted for as restructuring charges in the consolidated
statement of operations in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue Nos.
94-03 and 95-03.

                                                                ==========

     The final purchase price allocation will depend upon the actual purchase
price and the final valuation of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
upon the closing of the merger. Consequently, the actual allocation of the
purchase price could differ from that presented above.

(1) UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheets give effect to
the merger as if it had occurred on June 30, 2001 and combines Sanmina's June
30, 2001 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet with SCI's March 25,
2001 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. Certain SCI amounts have
been reclassified to conform to Sanmina's method of presentation.

     The following adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed balance sheet:

          (A) To reclassify SCI's accounts payable and accrued liabilities to
     conform with Sanmina's presentation and to classify Sanmina's current
     portion of long-term debt as a separate line item.

          (B) To reclassify SCI's redeemable long-term debt to current
     liabilities. Due to existing change of control provisions in the related
     SCI debt agreements, Sanmina is currently determining whether these debt
     issuances will be refinanced or repaid, or a combination thereof. Sanmina's
     ultimate plan in connection with the redemption of the debt will be
     determined at the date of the acquisition based on the facts and
     circumstances existing at that date.

          (C) To record the purchase of SCI by Sanmina through the issuance of
     Sanmina common stock and options, and to record estimated transaction costs
     and deferred compensation associated with the purchase. Deferred
     compensation represents a portion of the estimated intrinsic value of
     unvested SCI stock options assumed by Sanmina in the merger agreement to
     the extent that service is required to vest after the closing date of the
     merger (see also Note (J)). In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
     Issue No. 99-12, the value of Sanmina common stock to be issued is based on
     the average closing market price of Sanmina stock during the five trading
     days ending July 17, 2001.

          (D) To eliminate SCI's historical goodwill and intangible assets.

          (E) To eliminate SCI's historical equity balances including
     preacquisition retained earnings.

          (F) To record deferred tax liabilities attributable to tax effect of
     pro forma adjustments and to identifiable intangible assets acquired.

          (G) To eliminate accounts receivable and accounts payable balances
     between Sanmina and SCI.

(2) UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

     The pro forma combined condensed statements of operations give effect to
the merger as if it had occurred on October 3, 1999. Sanmina's unaudited
consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2001,
has been combined with SCI's unaudited consolidated statement of income for the
nine

                     NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED
                   CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

months ended March 25, 2001. Sanmina's audited statement of operations for the
year ended September 30, 2000 has been combined with SCI's audited statement of
income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000.

     The following adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed statements of operations:

          (H) To eliminate the revenue and cost of sales for transactions
     between Sanmina and SCI.

          (I) To remove amortization of historical goodwill and other intangible
     assets previously recorded by SCI and to record the amortization of
     identifiable intangible assets resulting from the allocation of the SCI
     purchase price. The pro forma adjustments assume identifiable intangible
     assets acquired from SCI will be amortized on a straight-line basis over an
     estimated life of five to eight years. The ultimate lives assigned to
     identifiable intangible assets acquired from SCI will be determined at the
     date of acquisition based on the facts and circumstances existing at that
     date.

          (J) To record the amortization of deferred compensation associated
     with the intrinsic value of unvested SCI options assumed by Sanmina.
     Deferred compensation represents a portion of the estimated intrinsic value
     of unvested SCI stock options assumed by Sanmina in the merger agreement to
     the extent that service is required after the closing date of the merger in
     order to vest. In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
     issued FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
     Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB No. 25. The
     Interpretation, which was effective as of July 1, 2000, results in
     compensation charges over the remaining term of the option's vesting
     period. Sanmina expects to amortize the value assigned to deferred
     compensation of approximately $6.6 million over an average remaining
     vesting period of three years.

          (K) To reflect the estimated number of shares to be issued as
     consideration for the SCI acquisition based on an exchange ratio of SCI
     stock to Sanmina stock of 1.36.

          (L) The historical consolidated statements of operations of SCI for
     the year ended June 30, 2001 and the nine months ended March 25, 2001
     combine these captions as line items entitled "Costs and Expenses," and for
     the nine months ended March 25, 2001, "Non-Recurring Special Charges."
     These costs reflect the reclassification of SCI's "Costs and Expenses" and
     "Non-Recurring Special Charges" to conform with Sanmina's presentation.

          (M) To record the tax effect of the removal of SCI amortization of
     historical goodwill, the amortization of identifiable intangibles recorded,
     and the amortization of the deferred compensation related to SCI assumed
     options.

                      DESCRIPTION OF SANMINA CAPITAL STOCK

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK

     The following summary of certain provisions of Sanmina common stock and
preferred stock does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified
in its entirety by, the provisions of Sanmina's restated certificate of
incorporation and by the provisions of applicable law. All material elements of
Sanmina's restated certificate of incorporation are described in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

     Common Stock.  Sanmina's certificate of incorporation authorizes Sanmina to
issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value. As of
[     ], 2001, there were approximately [     ] shares of common stock issued
and outstanding, held by [     ] stockholders of record.

     The holders of Sanmina common stock are entitled to one vote per share on
all matters to be voted on by stockholders. Holders of common stock are entitled
to receive dividends declared by the board of directors, out of funds legally
available for the payment of dividends, subject to the rights of holders of
preferred stock. Currently, Sanmina is not paying a dividend. Upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our business, the holders of common
stock are entitled to share equally in all assets available for distribution
after payment of all liabilities and provision for liquidation preference of
shares of preferred stock then outstanding. The holders of common stock have no
preemptive rights and no rights to convert their common stock into any other
securities. There are also no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable
to Sanmina common stock. All outstanding shares are fully paid and
non-assessable.

     Sanmina common stock does not have cumulative voting rights. As a result,
the holders of more than 50% of the shares of common stock voting for the
election of directors can elect all the directors if they choose to do so, and,
in such event, the holders of the remaining shares of common stock will not be
able to elect any person or persons to the board of directors. Under Delaware
law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action
which may be taken at a meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing
setting forth the action to be taken are signed by the holders of common stock
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
were present and voted. Sanmina's bylaws provide that, upon receipt of written
notice from a stockholder wishing stockholder action to be taken by written
consent, the board of directors has ten days to set a record date for such
action and may set the record date to be up to ten days following the expiration
of such period. Sanmina's bylaws also provide that stockholders wishing to
nominate directors or present proposals at Sanmina's annual meeting of
stockholders must comply with certain notice requirements, including, among
other things, timely delivery of written notice thereof not less than forty-five
days nor more than seventy-five days prior to the first anniversary of the date
on which Sanmina first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's
annual meeting of stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions
could in certain circumstances have the effect of delaying, deferring, or
preventing extraordinary corporate transactions such as a merger,
reorganization, sale of substantially all of Sanmina's assets, or liquidation.

     Preferred Stock.  Sanmina's certificate of incorporation authorizes Sanmina
to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value. As of
[     ], 2001, there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.
At present, Sanmina has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

     The board of directors has the authority, without further action by the
stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more
series and to fix the rights, qualifications, preferences, privileges,
limitations and restrictions of each such series, including the dividend rights,
dividend rate or rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption
(including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, liquidation
preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or the designations
of such series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Thus,
any series may, if so determined by Sanmina's board of directors, have
disproportionately high voting rights or class voting rights, be convertible
into or exchangeable for Sanmina common stock or another security of Sanmina, be
redeemable, carry the right to specified participating dividends (which may be
fixed or adjustable and which may be cumulative) and have such other relative
rights, preferences and limitations as the board of directors shall determine.

Issuance of authorized but unissued shares of Sanmina common stock or preferred
stock (including issuance upon conversion of any convertible preferred stock)
could cause a dilution of the book value of Sanmina common stock and (in the
case of Sanmina common stock and preferred stock with voting rights) would
dilute the voting power of the then current stockholders. The issuance of
preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change in control of Sanmina without further action by the stockholders, may
discourage bids for Sanmina common stock at a premium over the market price of
Sanmina common stock and may adversely affect the market price of Sanmina common
stock.

     In connection with Sanmina's preferred stock rights agreement, 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock have been designated series A participating preferred
stock. No shares of the series A participating preferred stock have been issued
or are issuable until the occurrence of certain triggering events. See
"-- Preferred Stock Purchase Rights."

PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

     In May 2001, Sanmina's board of directors adopted a preferred stock rights
agreement. Pursuant to the rights agreement, Sanmina declared a dividend of one
right for each outstanding share of Sanmina common stock and each share of
Sanmina common stock issued thereafter. Initially, each right entitles the
holder thereof to purchase from Sanmina one one-thousandth share of Sanmina
series A participating preferred stock at an exercise price of $200.00, subject
to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar events. The rights
are not exercisable until the occurrence of certain triggering events.

     In the event that a person obtains 15% or more of Sanmina's common stock,
each right becomes exercisable for shares of Sanmina common stock (or, in
certain circumstances as determined by the Sanmina board of directors, a
combination of cash, property, common stock or other securities) having a value
of twice the right's purchase price. Alternatively, in the event that, after an
acquiring person obtains 15% or more of Sanmina's common stock, Sanmina is
involved in a merger or other business combination transaction or a sale of 50%
or more of Sanmina's assets or earning power, each right becomes exercisable for
shares of common stock of such acquiring company having a value of twice the
right's purchase price. The rights are redeemable up to five days following such
acquisition, subject to extension by Sanmina's board of directors, at a price of
$0.001 per right. The rights plan expires in June 2011 unless Sanmina redeems
the rights earlier.

     Pursuant to the rights agreement, Sanmina's board of directors designated
1,000,000 shares of series A participating preferred stock, and reserved those
shares for issuance under the rights agreement. Each one one-thousandth of a
share of series A participating preferred stock purchasable upon exercise of the
rights has rights and preferences substantially equivalent to those of one
common share.

     The rights are designed to protect Sanmina stockholders in the event of an
unsolicited attempt by an acquirer to take over Sanmina in a manner or on terms
not approved by the board of directors. The rights are not intended to prevent a
takeover of Sanmina and will not do so. Subject to the restrictions described
above, the rights may be redeemed by Sanmina. Accordingly, the rights should not
interfere with any merger or business combination approved by Sanmina's board of
directors.

CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS

     Certain provisions of Sanmina's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may
have the effect of preventing, discouraging or delaying any change of control of
Sanmina. The authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for
the Sanmina board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other
rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change
control of Sanmina. There are also a substantial number of authorized but
unissued shares of Sanmina common stock that could be issued for such purpose.
See "COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF SCI COMMON STOCK AND SANMINA COMMON
STOCK -- Anti-Takeover Provisions; Restrictions on Certain Business
Combinations."

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     The transfer agent and registrar for Sanmina's common stock is Wells Fargo
Bank Minnesota, National Association. Its address is 161 North Concord Exchange,
South St. Paul, Minnesota 55075-0738 and its telephone number is (800) 468-9716.

                            COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF
              HOLDERS OF SANMINA COMMON STOCK AND SCI COMMON STOCK

GENERAL

     SCI stockholders will automatically become Sanmina stockholders at the
effective time. As stockholders of Sanmina, their rights will be determined by
Sanmina's certificate of incorporation, Sanmina's bylaws and Delaware law. The
following is a summary of the material differences in the rights of holders of
Sanmina common stock and SCI common stock. This summary is necessarily general
and is not a complete discussion of, and is qualified by, the more detailed
provisions of Delaware law, SCI's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and
Sanmina's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL

     Sanmina.  Sanmina is authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value of $0.01 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value of $0.01 per share. As of the Sanmina record date, [     ], 2001,
[     ] shares of Sanmina common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares
of Sanmina preferred stock were issued or outstanding.

     SCI.  SCI is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par
value of $0.10 per share, and 500,000 shares of preferred stock without par
value. As of the SCI record date, [     ], 2001, [     ] shares of SCI common
stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of SCI preferred stock were
issued or outstanding.

AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

     Sanmina.  Delaware law generally requires that an amendment to a Delaware
corporation's certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon. Furthermore, under
Delaware law, the holders of the outstanding shares of a class are entitled to
vote as a class upon any proposed amendment to the certificate of incorporation,
whether or not entitled to vote thereon by the provisions of the corporation's
certificate of incorporation, if the amendment would increase or decrease the
aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, increase or decrease the
par value of the shares of such class, or alter or change the powers,
preferences or specific rights of the shares of such class so as to adversely
affect them. Sanmina's certificate of incorporation does not alter these voting
requirements of Delaware law.

     Delaware law permits a corporation's board of directors to amend its bylaws
without further approval by the stockholders if so provided in the company's
certificate of incorporation. Sanmina's certificate of incorporation provides
that the board of directors may amend the bylaws without stockholder consent.
Sanmina's bylaws provide that the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares
of common stock of Sanmina entitled to vote at an election of directors may also
amend the bylaws.

     SCI.  Generally, an amendment to SCI's certificate of incorporation
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to
vote. To amend certain provisions of SCI's certificate of incorporation, the
affirmative vote of at least 70% of the shares entitled to vote is required,
unless the amendment is recommended by not less than two-thirds of the board of
directors.

     SCI's certificate of incorporation allows the board of directors to amend
the bylaws without stockholder approval.

NOTICE OF MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Sanmina and SCI.  The bylaws of Sanmina and SCI each provide that each
company must notify its stockholders between 10 and 60 days before any annual or
special meeting of the date, time and place of the meeting. In the case of a
special meeting, the companies must specify the purpose or purposes of the
meeting. In addition, Delaware law requires the notice to include the method of
remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting.

SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Sanmina.  The board of directors, chairman of the board of directors,
president or secretary of Sanmina may call a special meeting of the stockholders
at any time. In addition, if Sanmina should have no directors in office, then
any stockholder or officer of Sanmina may call a special meeting of the
stockholders. Written notice of such meeting must be delivered to the president
or secretary of Sanmina and no business may be conducted at the special meeting
other than specified in such notice.

     SCI.  A special meeting of the stockholders of SCI may be called by the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of the board of directors, the chairman of the
board of directors or by the holders of 70% of the outstanding stock of SCI,
stating the specific purpose for the meeting.

STOCKHOLDER PROXIES

     Sanmina.  The Sanmina bylaws require stockholder proxies to be filed with
the secretary of Sanmina prior to any shareholder meeting, and provide that
proxies are not effective after three years unless expressly stated otherwise.

     SCI.  The SCI bylaws do not restrict the use of proxies in any manner.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS; ADVANCE NOTICE OF DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS

     Sanmina.  Sanmina's bylaws allow any stockholder to nominate candidates for
election to Sanmina's board of directors at the annual meeting, or at special
meetings called for electing directors. Sanmina stockholders may also propose
business to be brought before an annual stockholder meeting. A stockholder who
seeks to nominate a candidate or make a proposal must give timely written notice
to the secretary of Sanmina before the stockholder meeting, and must have been a
stockholder of record on the date notice of the stockholder meeting was given
and entitled to vote at such meeting. Notice by a Sanmina stockholder is timely
if it is delivered to the secretary of Sanmina not less than 45 days nor more
than 75 days prior to the first anniversary of the date Sanmina mailed its proxy
materials for the previous year's annual meeting.

     A stockholder's notice to Sanmina for nominations or other business to be
properly brought before the annual meeting must include the name and address of
the stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, as they appear on Sanmina's
books and the class and number of shares of Sanmina which are owned by the
stockholder. The notice must also state whether such stockholder or beneficial
owner intends to deliver a proxy statement or proxies sufficient to elect the
nominated director or pass the proposal. A stockholder's notice for proposed
business must also include a brief description of the business the stockholder
proposes to bring before the meeting, the reasons for conducting that business
at that meeting and any material interest of the stockholder in the business
proposed and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made.

     SCI.  SCI's bylaws do not provide for specific stockholder notice
provisions to nominate candidates for election to SCI's board of directors or to
propose business to be brought before an annual or special stockholder meeting.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

     Sanmina and SCI.  Neither Sanmina's nor SCI's certificate of incorporation
provides for cumulative voting of directors. Each SCI stockholder is entitled to
one vote for each share of SCI stock he or she holds in the election of
directors, and each Sanmina stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share
of Sanmina stock he or she holds in the election of directors.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

     Sanmina.  The number of directors is presently fixed at 7 under Sanmina's
bylaws. The number of directors may be changed by an amendment to the bylaws
adopted by the board of directors or stockholders. Directors are elected at each
annual meeting of stockholders and serve until a successor is elected at the
next

annual meeting. Sanmina's board of directors will amend Sanmina's bylaws to
increase the number of directors from 7 to 10 effective upon the consummation of
the merger.

     SCI.  SCI's bylaws provide for a number of directors between 3 and 11, with
the exact number to be fixed and determined from time to time by resolution of a
majority of the board of directors.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Sanmina.  Sanmina's bylaws provide that any director may be removed, with
or without cause, at any time by vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at an election of directors,
or by written consent of the stockholders as provided in Sanmina's bylaws.

     SCI.  SCI's bylaws provide that at any stockholder meeting called expressly
for such purpose, any or all directors may be removed from office with or
without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
entitled to vote at an election of directors.

BOARD OF DIRECTOR VACANCIES

     Sanmina.  Under Delaware law, vacancies and newly created directorships may
be filled by a majority of the directors in office, even though less than a
quorum, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws.
The Sanmina bylaws provide that vacancies on the board of directors may only be
filled by the vote of the majority of directors then in office, including, in
the case of any vacancy created by resignation which is to be effective at a
future date, those directors who have so resigned. The Sanmina bylaws also
provide that vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of
the directors that are in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director.

     SCI.  Neither the bylaws nor the certificate of incorporation of SCI limits
or expands upon the Delaware law regarding this issue.

BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK

     Sanmina.  Sanmina's certificate of incorporation authorizes its board of
directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix
the designations, preferences, powers and rights of the shares to be included in
each series. Sanmina certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 1,000,000 shares have been
designated series A participating preferred stock in connection with its
preferred stock rights agreement.

     SCI.  SCI's certificate of incorporation further provides, in the event of
a settlement, indemnification shall be provided only in connection with such
matters covered by the settlement as to which the corporation is advised by its
counsel that the person to be indemnified did not commit a breach of duty to the
corporation.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS; RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     Sanmina and SCI.  According to Delaware law, a company will be subject to
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law,
unless it elects to opt out by including an express provision to that effect in
its bylaws. Neither Sanmina nor SCI has elected to opt-out of Section 203 and as
a result, are subject to its protection. In general, Section 203 prohibits a
publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination"
with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years following the date
the person became an interested stockholder, unless:

     - prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the
       corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction
       which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

     - the stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation
       outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes
       of determining the number of shares outstanding (a) shares owned by
       persons who are directors and also officers, and (b) shares owned by
       employee

       stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to
       determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be
       tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or

     - on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination
       is approved by the board and authorized at an annual or special meeting
       of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of
       at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by
       the interested stockholder.

     Generally, a "business combination" includes a merger, asset or stock sale,
or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested
stockholder. An "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with
affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the
determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a
corporation's outstanding voting securities.

     Both Sanmina and SCI have determined that the contemplated transaction for
which this proxy statement is being disseminated is not a business combination
within the meaning of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     SCI.  SCI has an additional provision in its certificate of incorporation
requiring approval by the holders of at least 70% of the outstanding stock
entitled to vote before it is able to engage in a business combination with an
interested stockholder. Such a business combination does not require a 70%
approval, however, if it is approved by two-thirds of its Continuing Directors
(as defined in SCI's certificate of incorporation) and certain fair price
requirements are met with respect to the consideration offered in the business
combination. SCI has determined that the contemplated transaction for which this
proxy statement is being disseminated does not qualify as a business combination
under the terms of its certificate incorporation.

STOCKHOLDERS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS

     Sanmina.  On May 17, 2001, the Sanmina board adopted a preferred stock
rights agreement, under which rights to purchase one one-thousandth share of
series A participating preferred stock at an exercise price of $200.00 were
distributed to holders of common stock at the rate of one right for each share
of common stock held as of the close of business on June 15, 2001. The Sanmina
rights agreement is designed to protect Sanmina stockholders in the event of an
unsolicited attempt by an acquirer to obtain control over Sanmina without
offering a fair price to all of Sanmina's stockholders. The Sanmina rights
agreement was not adopted in response to any specific takeover attempt and will
not prevent a takeover of Sanmina that is approved by the board of directors.

     SCI.  On December 20, 2000 the SCI board adopted a rights agreement, under
which rights to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $240.00 per
share were distributed to holders of common stock at the rate of one right for
each share of common stock held as of the close of business on January 1, 2001.
The SCI rights agreement was adopted as part of a continuing program by SCI's
board of directors to allow the board of directors to respond in an orderly
fashion to any unsolicited activity that may occur which, in the judgment of the
board of directors, is inadequate or unfair to SCI's stockholders. The SCI board
of directors has amended the rights agreement to make it inapplicable to the
merger.

LIMITATION ON DIRECTOR LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

     Sanmina.  Sanmina's certificate of incorporation provides that no director
shall be personally liable to Sanmina or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for:

     - any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to Sanmina or its
       stockholders;

     - acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or knowing violation of law;

     - authorizing the payment of a dividend or repurchase of stock; or

     - any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit.

     The limitation of liability provided herein shall continue after a director
has ceased to occupy such position as to acts or omissions occurring during such
director's term or terms of office.

     SCI.  SCI's certificate of incorporation provides that it shall indemnify
every director and officer, his heirs, executors and administrators, against
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding
by reason of being or having been an officer of the corporation, except in
relation to matters as to which he shall be finally adjudged in such action suit
or proceeding to have been liable thereunder by reason of negligence or
misconduct.

     SCI's certificate of incorporation further provides, in the event of a
settlement, indemnification shall be provided only in connection with such
matters covered by the settlement as to which the corporation is advised by its
counsel that the person to be indemnified did not commit a breach of duty to the
corporation.

ACTIONS BY WRITTEN CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Sanmina.  Pursuant to Sanmina's bylaws, stockholders may execute an action,
without prior notice and without a vote, by written consent in lieu of a meeting
of the stockholders. Such written consent will be effective if signed by
stockholders representing the number of voting shares outstanding as would have
been required to approve such action at an actual meeting of the stockholders.
If, however, the written consent is not unanimous, prompt notice of the action
must be provided to non-consenting stockholders. The stockholders seeking to act
by written consent must first request that the board of directors set a record
date to determine the number of shares required to approve the action.

     SCI.  SCI's certificate of incorporation provides that any action required
or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders of the corporation may
be taken without a meeting if written consent, setting forth the action to be
taken, shall be signed by stockholders holding not less than 70% of SCI's
outstanding stock entitled to vote on the matter.

STOCKHOLDER INSPECTION RIGHTS; STOCKHOLDER LISTS

     Sanmina and SCI.  Delaware law requires a corporation to prepare at least
10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of
each stockholder. Delaware law requires such list to be open to the examination
of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of time
at least 10 days prior to the meeting.

     Neither the bylaws nor the certificate of incorporation of either Sanmina
or SCI limits or expands upon these rights.

DISSENTERS' APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Sanmina and SCI.  Generally, stockholders of a Delaware corporation who
dissent from a merger or consolidation of the corporation for which a
stockholders' vote is required are entitled to appraisal rights, requiring the
surviving corporation to purchase the dissenting shares at fair value. There
are, however, generally no statutory rights of appraisal with respect to
stockholders of a Delaware corporation whose shares of stock are either: (a)
listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national market
system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc.; or (b) held of record by more than 2,000
stockholders where such stockholders receive only shares of stock of the
corporation surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation (or cash in
lieu of fractional interests therein).

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED
                      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the
"AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of July 13, 2001, among Sanmina
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Sun Acquisition Subsidiary,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER
SUB") and SCI Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("COMPANY").

                                    RECITALS

     A. Whereas, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
Company have determined that it is in the best interests of each corporation and
their respective stockholders that the Company and Parent enter into a strategic
business combination transaction by means of the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "MERGER") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the
Merger and declared the Merger advisable;

     B. Whereas, pursuant to the Merger, the outstanding shares of common stock
of Company will be converted into shares of common stock of Parent at the rate
set forth herein; and

     C. Whereas, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 (a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"); and

     D. Whereas, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as an
inducement to Parent's and Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
(i) certain affiliates of Company are entering into Voting Agreements in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 (the "COMPANY VOTING
AGREEMENTS") and (ii) certain affiliates of Parent are entering into Voting
Agreements substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-2 (the "PARENT
VOTING Agreements").

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                     MERGER

          1.1 The Merger.  At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
     subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
     applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
     into Company (the "MERGER"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
     shall cease and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
     "SURVIVING CORPORATION").

          1.2 Effective Time; Closing.  Subject to the provisions of this
     Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
     filing the Certificate of Merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the
     Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
     provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL" or "DELAWARE
     LAW") (the time of such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in
     writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger)
     being the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing
     Date (as hereinafter defined). Unless the context otherwise requires, the
     term "AGREEMENT" as used herein refers collectively to this Agreement and
     Plan of Reorganization and the Certificate of Merger. The closing of the
     Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini
     Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
     California, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall
     be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver
     of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and
     location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE").

                                       A-5

          1.3 Effect of the Merger.  At the Effective Time, the effect of the
     Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions
     of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
     thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers
     and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
     Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger
     Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
     Corporation.

          1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.  At the Effective Time, the
     Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
     to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
     Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such
     Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation; provided,
     however, that at the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the
     Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving
     Corporation shall be "Sun, Inc." The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
     immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time,
     the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.

          1.5 Directors and Officers.  The initial directors of the Surviving
     Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall be the directors
     of Merger Sub, until their respective successors are duly elected or
     appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
     shall be the officers of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
     until their respective successors are duly appointed.

          1.6 Effect on Capital Stock.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
     Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the
     holders of any of the following securities:

             (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock.  Each share of Common
        Stock, $0.10 par value per share, of Company (the "COMPANY COMMON
        STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
        other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
        Section 1.6(b), will be canceled and extinguished and automatically
        converted (subject to Section 1.6(f)) into the right to receive 1.36
        (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
        shares of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Parent (the
        "PARENT COMMON STOCK") upon surrender of the certificate representing
        such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7
        (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
        delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided
        in Section 1.9). If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
        immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
        repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any
        applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
        the Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
        for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and/or
        subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
        condition, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent
        Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Company
        shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and
        after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such
        repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
        purchase agreement or other agreement.

             (b) Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Held Stock.  Each
        share of Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub,
        Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or
        of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
        extinguished without any conversion thereof.

             (c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans.  At the Effective
        Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding
        under Company's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and
        Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the "COMPANY STOCK
        OPTION PLANS") shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8
        hereof. Rights outstanding under Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan
        shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.8.

                                       A-6

             (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  Each share of Common Stock,
        $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON
        STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
        shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
        share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving
        Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger
        Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital
        stock of the Surviving Corporation.

             (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.  The Exchange Ratio shall be
        adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse
        stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
        securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common
        Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like
        change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
        occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

             (f) Fractional Shares.  No fraction of a share of Parent Common
        Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each
        holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
        to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
        fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be
        received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash
        (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product obtained by
        multiplying (i) such fraction, by (ii) the average of the closing price
        of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market ("NASDAQ") for the
        five trading days immediately preceding the trading day on which the
        Effective Time occurs.

          1.7 Surrender of Certificates.

             (a) Exchange Agent.  Parent shall designate Wells Fargo Shareowner
        Services, the transfer agent for Parent's Common Stock, to act as the
        exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger.

             (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock.  Promptly after the Effective
        Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
        accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock
        issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of
        Company Common Stock, and cash in an amount sufficient for payment in
        lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends
        or distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may
        be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

             (c) Exchange Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
        shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
        the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the
        "CERTIFICATES"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
        represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
        converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
        pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant
        to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
        Section 1.7(d), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
        shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
        title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
        Certificates to the Exchange Agent and containing such other provisions
        as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
        effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
        representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any
        fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other
        distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates
        for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents
        as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
        duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
        thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive
        in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole
        shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has a right to receive
        pursuant to Section 1.6(a), payment in lieu of fractional shares which
        such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and
        any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and
        the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
        surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
        Effective Time, for all
                                       A-7

        corporate purposes, subject to Section 1.7(d) as to the payment of
        dividends or other distributions, to evidence only the right to receive
        the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange
        for such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and
        the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any
        fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or
        distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

             (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  No dividends
        or other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement
        with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
        Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered
        Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
        in exchange therefor until the holders of record of such Certificates
        shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following
        surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to
        the record holders thereof, without interest, certificates representing
        the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
        therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
        Section 1.6(f) hereof and the amount of any such dividends or other
        distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable with
        respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

             (e) Transfers of Ownership.  If certificates representing shares of
        Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which
        the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it
        will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so
        surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
        transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to
        Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes
        required by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares
        of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
        holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the reasonable
        satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has
        been paid or is not payable.

             (f) Required Withholding.  Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, and
        the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
        any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
        Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such
        amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
        the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or
        under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts
        are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
        purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom
        such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

             (g) No Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
        Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving
        Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares
        of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly
        paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
        escheat or similar law.

          1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  All shares
     of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof
     (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and
     1.7(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction
     of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At the
     Effective Time: (i) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled
     and retired and cease to exist, and all holders of Certificates
     representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
     stockholders of Company other than the rights expressly provided in this
     Agreement and (ii) there shall be no further registration of transfers on
     the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
     which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after
     the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
     for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
     Article I.

          1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event that any
     Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
     shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
                                       A-8

     Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
     thereof, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into
     which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates
     were converted pursuant to Section 1.6, cash for fractional shares, if any,
     as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or
     distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); provided, however, that
     Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
     of such certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash and
     other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
     Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
     indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
     Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged
     to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

          1.10 Tax Consequences.  It is intended by the parties hereto that the
     Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368
     of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
     reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
     the United States Treasury Regulations.

          1.11 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action.  If, at any time
     after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
     carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
     Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
     rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the
     officers and directors of Surviving Corporation and Parent, acting for and
     on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, shall be fully authorized to take
     all such lawful and necessary action. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
     perform all of its obligations relating to this Agreement and the
     transactions contemplated thereby.

                                   ARTICLE II

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

     Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to such
exceptions as are specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure letter
delivered by Company to Parent on or prior to the date of this Agreement and
certified by a duly authorized officer of Company (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE"), as follows (it being understood that disclosure in one instance is
sufficient for all purposes if the context thereof is reasonably evident and it
being understood that disclosure of an item is not to be construed as an
admission of any fact):

          2.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

             (a) Each of Company, its domestic subsidiaries and its foreign
        subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Canada or Mexico (the
        "COMPANY DESIGNATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES") is a corporation duly
        organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
        jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power
        and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to
        carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Company has
        delivered to Parent a complete and correct list of all of Company's
        direct and indirect subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement,
        indicating the jurisdiction of organization of each subsidiary and
        Company's equity interest therein. Each of Company, its domestic
        subsidiaries and each of the Company Designated Foreign Subsidiaries is
        in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
        permits, consents, certificates, approvals, variances, exemptions and
        orders ("APPROVALS") necessary to own, lease and operate the properties
        it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business and
        the business of its subsidiaries as it is now being conducted, except
        where the failure to have such Approvals would not, individually or in
        the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Each of
        Company, its domestic subsidiaries and each of the Company Designated
        Foreign Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms of the Approvals
        and is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
        business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
        character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
        nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing
        necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed

                                       A-9

        and in good standing that would not, either individually or in the
        aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Other than wholly
        owned subsidiaries, Company does not directly or indirectly own any
        material equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible or
        exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any
        corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business, association
        or entity.

             (b) Each of the foreign subsidiaries of Company that are
        incorporated under the laws of countries other than Canada or Mexico
        (the "COMPANY OTHER FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES") is, to the Company's
        knowledge, a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
        standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
        the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
        its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now
        being conducted. Each of the Company Other Foreign Subsidiaries is, to
