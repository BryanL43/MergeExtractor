                 PROPOSED MERGER -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Shareholders:                                              October 16, 2001

     The boards of directors of Global Marine Inc. and Santa Fe International
Corporation have each unanimously approved a "merger of equals" designed to
create the world's second largest offshore drilling contractor. We believe the
merger of our companies will provide the operational scale and market coverage
needed to deliver superior service to the world's leading oil and natural gas
companies. We also believe that the merger will benefit the shareholders of both
companies, and we ask for your support in voting for the merger-related
proposals at our respective shareholder meetings.

     In the merger, Global Marine stockholders will be entitled to receive 0.665
ordinary shares of Santa Fe International for each share of Global Marine common
stock they own. Santa Fe International shareholders will continue to own their
existing ordinary shares. Santa Fe International will be renamed GlobalSantaFe
Corporation at the time of the merger and will trade on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "GSF." Global Marine stockholders will own slightly
more than 50% of GlobalSantaFe after the merger.

     The merger cannot be completed unless the merger is approved by Global
Marine stockholders and the issuance of Santa Fe International ordinary shares
pursuant to the merger is approved by Santa Fe International shareholders. In
addition, Santa Fe International shareholders will vote on the approval of
"GlobalSantaFe Corporation" as the name of Santa Fe International after the
merger and certain amendments to the Santa Fe International memorandum of
association and articles of association in connection with the merger, as more
fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We have scheduled
separate meetings to be held on November 20, 2001 for our respective
shareholders to vote on these matters. The times and places of these meetings
are set forth in the attached notices.

     The boards of directors of Global Marine and Santa Fe International have
determined that the merger is in the best interest of their respective
shareholders, and each board unanimously recommends that its respective
shareholders vote "FOR" the merger-related proposals.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed
information about the proposed merger. You can also obtain financial and other
information about our companies from documents that we have filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to carefully read this
entire document and the documents incorporated by reference.

     You are cordially invited to attend the extraordinary general meeting of
Santa Fe International Corporation shareholders, at the time and place referred
to above, to:

          1. consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the issuance of
     ordinary shares of Santa Fe International in connection with the Agreement
     and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 31, 2001, attached as Annex A to the
     accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus, pursuant to which an
     indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Santa Fe International would merge with
     and into Global Marine and each share of Global Marine common stock would
     be converted into the right to receive 0.665 ordinary shares of Santa Fe
     International (which would be renamed GlobalSantaFe Corporation at the time
     of the merger), as a result of which Global Marine would become an indirect
     wholly owned subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe, conditional upon the completion
     of the merger;

          2. consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the change of Santa Fe
     International's name to "GlobalSantaFe Corporation" and to approve the
     amended and restated memorandum of association of Santa Fe International,
     as set forth as Annex F to the accompanying joint proxy
     statement/prospectus, conditional upon the completion of the merger;

          3. consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the amended and
     restated articles of association of Santa Fe International, as set forth as
     Annex G to the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus, conditional
     upon the completion of the merger; and

          4. transact other business that may properly come before the meeting
     or any adjournment thereof.

     Although, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules,
proposals one through three above are being presented separately, neither the
merger nor any of these proposals will be effected unless all three of the
proposals are approved by the shareholders.

     The record date for the extraordinary general meeting is the close of
business on October 15, 2001. Only holders of record of our ordinary shares at
the close of business on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the
meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Pursuant to the articles
of association, the resolution regarding the issuance of ordinary shares in
connection with the merger will be proposed as an ordinary resolution and the
resolutions to change the name and amend the memorandum of association and to
amend the articles of association will be proposed as special resolutions.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q. WHY ARE SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL AND GLOBAL
   MARINE PROPOSING TO MERGE?

A. We are proposing to merge because we believe
   that the combination of our companies will provide the operational scale and
   market coverage needed to deliver superior service to the world's leading oil
   and natural gas companies. By combining the companies, we expect to create
   the potential for stronger operating and financial results than either
   company could achieve on its own and, in doing so, procure substantial
   benefits for our customers, employees and shareholders.

Q. PLEASE BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE PROPOSED MERGER.

A. In the merger, an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Santa Fe International will merge with and into Global Marine, and
   Global Marine will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Santa Fe
   International, which will be renamed "GlobalSantaFe Corporation" at the time
   of the merger.

Q. WHAT WILL GLOBAL MARINE'S STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVE
   AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A. In the merger, Global Marine stockholders will
   be entitled to receive 0.665 ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe for each share
   of Global Marine common stock they own. Fractional shares will not be issued.
   Instead, Global Marine stockholders will receive cash for any fractional
   shares to which they would otherwise be entitled.

Q. WILL SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL SHAREHOLDERS
RECEIVE ANY NEW SHARES AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER?

A. No. Santa Fe International shareholders will
   continue to hold upon completion of the merger the ordinary shares they owned
   prior to the merger and will not receive any new shares. The change of Santa
   Fe International's name to GlobalSantaFe Corporation will not necessitate an
   exchange of share certificates by Santa Fe International shareholders.

Q. WHERE WILL MY SHARES BE LISTED AFTER THE
   MERGER?

A. After the merger, the ordinary shares of
GlobalSantaFe will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will trade under
   the ticker symbol "GSF."

Q. HOW MANY DIRECTORS WILL SERVE ON THE BOARD OF
   DIRECTORS OF GLOBALSANTAFE?

A. The initial board of directors of GlobalSantaFe
   will consist of the following 14 directors:

   - Robert E. Rose, Thomas W. Cason, C. Russell Luigs, Edward R. Muller, Paul
     J. Powers, Carroll W. Suggs and John L. Whitmire, each of whom is a current
     director of Global Marine and has been designated to become a director of
     GlobalSantaFe by Global Marine after consultation with Santa Fe
     International;

   - C. Stedman Garber, Jr., Ferdinand A. Berger, Richard L. George and Stephen
     J. Solarz, each of whom is a current director of Santa Fe International and
     has been designated to become a director of GlobalSantaFe by Santa Fe
     International after consultation with Global Marine; and

   - Nader H. Sultan, Khaled R. Al-Haroon and Maha A.R. Razzuqi, each of whom is
     a current director of Santa Fe International and has been designated to
     become a director of GlobalSantaFe by SFIC Holdings (Cayman), Inc., a
     wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and a significant
     shareholder of Santa Fe International.

Q. WHO WILL SERVE AS GLOBALSANTAFE'S CHAIRMAN AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS?

A. Robert E. Rose will become chairman of the board of directors of
   GlobalSantaFe, and C. Stedman Garber, Jr. will serve as president and chief
   executive officer. Jon A. Marshall will serve as executive vice president and
   chief operating officer, Seals M. McCarty will serve as executive vice
   president -- finance and administration, Joe E. Boyd will serve as senior
   vice president -- human resources, Roger B. Hunt will serve as senior vice
   president -- marketing, James L. McCulloch will serve as senior vice
   president, general counsel and secretary, W. Matt Ralls will serve as senior
   vice president and chief financial officer, and Marion M. Woolie will serve
   as senior vice president -- operations.

Q. WHAT ARE THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO SHAREHOLDERS?

A. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
   stockholders of Global Marine who are U.S. persons will be taxed on their
   gains in connection with the exchange of their shares in the merger but will
   not be allowed to recognize a loss. Stockholders of Global Marine who are not
   U.S. persons and shareholders of Santa Fe International will not be subject
   to U.S. federal income tax as a result of the merger.

Q. WILL SHAREHOLDERS HAVE APPRAISAL RIGHTS?

A. Neither Global Marine stockholders nor
   Santa Fe International shareholders will have any right to receive an
   appraisal of the value of their shares in connection with the merger.

Q. WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE MERGER TO BE
   COMPLETED?

A. We intend to complete the merger as quickly as
   possible after all the conditions to the merger, including obtaining the
   approvals of our respective shareholders at the shareholder meetings, are
   satisfied or waived. Satisfaction of some of these conditions, including
   receipt of governmental clearances or approvals, is not entirely within our
   control. Subject to obtaining the approvals of our respective shareholders at
   the shareholder meetings and receipt of all required governmental clearances
   and approvals, we expect to complete the merger immediately following the
   shareholder meetings.

Q. WHAT SHAREHOLDER APPROVALS ARE NEEDED?

A. Global Marine stockholders are being asked to
   approve and adopt the merger agreement.

   Santa Fe International shareholders are being asked to approve:

   - the issuance of Santa Fe International ordinary shares in connection with
     the merger;

   - the change of Santa Fe International's name to "GlobalSantaFe Corporation"
     and the amended and restated memorandum of association of Santa Fe
     International; and

   - the amended and restated articles of association of Santa Fe International.

   Because all of the Santa Fe International proposals must be approved in order
   for the merger or any of the proposals to be effected, a vote against any
   proposal has the same effect as a vote against all of the proposals. The
   merger will not occur and none of the proposals will be effected unless all
   of the proposals are approved.

Q. HOW DO I VOTE?

A. Both companies' shareholder meetings will take place on November 20, 2001.
   After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this
   document and the documents incorporated by reference, please respond by
   completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card (or filling out voting
   instructions if you hold your shares through a broker) and returning it in
   the enclosed postage paid envelope as soon as possible, so that your shares
   may be represented at your shareholder meeting.

   In addition, if you hold shares of either company through a broker, hold
   Global Marine shares directly or through the Global Marine 401(k) Savings
   Incentive Plan, or hold Santa Fe International shares through the Santa Fe
   International Investment Savings and Profit Sharing Plan 401(k) or the Santa
   Fe International Employee Share Purchase Plan, you may be able to vote those
   shares over the Internet or by telephone. See the "-- Voting Via the Internet
   or by Telephone" subsections of "The Santa Fe International Extraordinary
   General Meeting" and "The Special Meeting of Global Marine Stockholders"
   sections.

   Please review the instructions in the proxy statement and on your proxy card
   or voting instructions regarding each of these voting options.

Q. WHAT VOTE DOES MY BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND?

A. The Global Marine board of directors unanimously recommends that Global
   Marine's stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement.

   The Santa Fe International board of directors unanimously recommends that
   Santa Fe International shareholders approve:

   - the issuance of Santa Fe International ordinary shares in connection with
     the merger;

   - the change of Santa Fe International's name to "GlobalSantaFe Corporation"
     and the amended and restated memorandum of association of Santa Fe
     International; and

   - the amended and restated articles of association of Santa Fe International.

   The implementation of the Santa Fe International proposals is conditional
   upon the completion of the merger, and none of the proposals will be effected
   until they are all approved.

Q. HOW DO I CHANGE MY VOTE?

A. Registered owners can change their vote at any time before their proxy card
   is voted at their company's shareholder meeting. You can do this in one of
   three ways:

   - you can send a written notice stating that you would like to revoke your
     proxy;

   - you can complete and submit a new proxy card; or

   - you can attend your meeting and vote in person.

   If you submit your proxy or voting instructions over the Internet or by
   telephone, you can change your vote by submitting a proxy at a later date,
   using the same procedures, in which case your later submitted proxy or voting
   instructions will be recorded and your earlier proxy or voting instructions
   will be revoked. If you have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you
   must follow the procedure provided by your broker to change those
   instructions.

Q. WHAT IF I PLAN TO ATTEND THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING IN PERSON?

A. We recommend that you send in your proxy
   card or voting instructions even if you plan to attend the meeting in person.
   You may still attend the meeting and, if you are a shareholder of record,
   vote in person.

Q. IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY
   BROKER, WILL MY BROKER VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME WITHOUT MY INSTRUCTIONS?

A. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares
   unless the broker receives specific instructions from you. We recommend that
   you contact your broker to obtain directions on how to instruct your broker
   to vote your shares.

Q. SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES?

A. No. After the merger is completed, we will send
   written instructions to Global Marine stockholders, including a letter of
   transmittal, that explains how to exchange Global Marine stock certificates
   for GlobalSantaFe share certificates. Please do not send in any Global Marine
   stock certificates until you receive these written instructions and the
   letter of transmittal.

   Santa Fe International's shareholders will keep their current share
   certificates which will represent GlobalSantaFe share certificates after
   completion of the merger.

THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING AND SPECIAL MEETING (PAGES 28 AND 32)

     Santa Fe International.  The extraordinary general meeting of Santa Fe
International's shareholders will be held on November 20, 2001 at 9:00 a.m.,
Central Time, at the Doubletree Hotel Lincoln Centre, Skybridge Room II, 5410
LBJ Freeway, Dallas, Texas.

     The record date for Santa Fe International's shareholders entitled to
receive notice of and to vote at Santa Fe International's extraordinary general
meeting was the close of business on October 15, 2001. On that date,
approximately 115 million Santa Fe International ordinary shares were

SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL VOTES REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL OF THE SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL
PROPOSALS (PAGE 29)

     The proposal seeking approval for the issuance of Santa Fe International
ordinary shares in connection with the merger requires the approval of holders
of a majority of the ordinary shares present in person or by proxy at the
extraordinary general meeting and voting on the proposal, provided that holders
of a majority of the ordinary shares entitled to vote on the proposal actually
vote. This proposal must be approved in order to complete the merger.

     The proposal seeking approval of the change of Santa Fe International's
name to "GlobalSantaFe Corporation" and approval of the amended and restated
memorandum of association of Santa Fe International requires the approval of
holders of two-thirds of the ordinary shares present in person or by proxy at
the extraordinary general meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. This
proposal must also be approved in order to complete the merger.

     The proposal seeking approval of the amended and restated articles of
association of Santa Fe International requires the approval of holders of
two-thirds of the ordinary shares present in person or by proxy at the
extraordinary general meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. This
proposal must also be approved in order to complete the merger.

     Each of these proposals is conditional upon completion of the merger.
Because all proposals must be approved in order for the merger or any of the
proposals to be effected, a vote against any proposal has the same effect as a
vote against all of the proposals. The merger will not occur and none of the
proposals will be effected unless all of the proposals are approved.

     Shareholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares
of Santa Fe International entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting
must be present, in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the
extraordinary general meeting.

     As of the record date, Santa Fe International directors and executive
officers beneficially owned less than one percent of the then outstanding
ordinary shares of Santa Fe International, excluding outstanding options. These
individuals have indicated that they intend to vote in favor of the Santa Fe
International proposals. In addition, SFIC Holdings (Cayman), Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, holds 43,500,000 ordinary
shares of Santa Fe International, representing approximately 37.7% of the
outstanding ordinary shares of Santa Fe International. SFIC Holdings has
authorized Nader H. Sultan and Maha A.R. Razzuqi to vote these shares on behalf
of SFIC Holdings in person or by proxy at the extraordinary general meeting.
Nader H. Sultan and Maha A.R. Razzuqi are both directors of Santa Fe
International and have both disclaimed beneficial ownership of such ordinary
shares. SFIC Holdings has entered into a shareholder agreement with Global
Marine, in which SFIC Holdings has, subject to certain conditions, agreed to
vote all of the 43,500,000 ordinary shares owned by it in favor of the Santa Fe
International proposals.

     SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THAT THE MERGER IS IN
THE BEST INTEREST OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND UNANIMOUSLY
RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL

NAME TO GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND THE AMENDED AND RESTATED MEMORANDUM OF

     In connection with the proposed merger, Santa Fe International's financial
advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, delivered a written opinion to
the Santa Fe International board of directors as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to Santa Fe International of the merger ratio provided
for in the merger. The full text of Credit Suisse First Boston's written

statement/prospectus as Annex B. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully
in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken. CREDIT SUISSE FIRST
BOSTON'S OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS
AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY SHAREHOLDER AS TO ANY MATTER

the special meeting.

RECOMMENDATION OF GLOBAL MARINE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (PAGE 41)

     GLOBAL MARINE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE TO AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF
GLOBAL MARINE'S STOCKHOLDERS AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THE APPROVAL AND
ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

OPINION OF GLOBAL MARINE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (PAGE 46)

     In deciding to approve the merger, on August 31, 2001, Global Marine's
board of directors received and considered the oral opinion of Morgan Stanley &
Co. Incorporated, its financial advisor, that, as of that date,

the merger ratio under the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of
view to Global Marine stockholders. Morgan Stanley subsequently confirmed its
oral opinion by delivery of its written opinion dated August 31, 2001. Morgan
Stanley based its opinion on and delivered it subject to the assumptions,
limitations and qualifications stated in the opinion. The full text of the
written opinion of Morgan Stanley is attached to this joint proxy

in its entirety, as well as the description of the analyses and assumptions upon
which the opinion was based. MORGAN STANLEY'S OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE GLOBAL
MARINE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY
STOCKHOLDER AS TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE MERGER.

MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 68)

     The merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. The merger agreement is the document that governs the
merger. We urge you to read this document carefully.

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine are proposing a merger transaction
in which Global Marine will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Santa
Fe International and Santa Fe International will change its name to
GlobalSantaFe Corporation. The following will occur as a result of the merger:

     - Each share of Global Marine common stock will be automatically converted
       into the right to receive 0.665 ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe.
       Immediately after completion of the merger, Global Marine stockholders
       will own slightly over 50% of GlobalSantaFe.

     - Each outstanding Santa Fe International ordinary share will remain
       outstanding as one ordinary share of GlobalSantaFe. Immediately after
       completion of the merger, Santa Fe International shareholders will own
       slightly under 50% of GlobalSantaFe.

     - Each option to purchase a share of Global Marine common stock under
       Global Marine's stock option plans will become an option to purchase
       0.665 ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe.

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER (PAGE 75)

     The completion of the merger is dependent on a number of conditions,
including the following:

     - approval by Global Marine's stockholders of the proposal to adopt the
       merger agreement;

     - approval by Santa Fe International's shareholders of:

      - the issuance of Santa Fe International ordinary shares pursuant to the
        merger;

      - the proposed amendments to Santa Fe International's memorandum of
        association, including the change of Santa Fe International's name to
        GlobalSantaFe Corporation, and the proposed amendments to Santa Fe
        International's articles of association;

     - the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the
       Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (this condition was
       satisfied on September 27, 2001);

     - in the event of any review by the U.K. Office of Fair Trading or the U.K.
       Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the parties having received
       indications reasonably satisfactory to each of Global Marine and Santa Fe
       International that the merger will not be referred to the Competition
       Commission of the United Kingdom or, if it is so referred, that it can
       proceed;

     - none of the parties to the merger agreement having become subject to any
       decree, order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction that
       prohibits the merger and no governmental authority having enacted any
       statute, rule or regulation that prohibits the merger or makes it
       unlawful;

     - the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the Securities and
       Exchange Commission, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms
       a part, having become effective and no stop order with respect to such
       registration statement being in effect;

     - the authorization for listing of the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares to be
       issued in the merger on the New York Stock Exchange;

     - the absence of any event or occurrence having or reasonably likely to
       have, individually or in the aggregate with all other such events or
       occurrences, a material adverse effect on Santa Fe International's or
       Global Marine's business, assets, financial condition or results of
       operations or its ability to complete the merger or fulfill the
       conditions to closing of the merger; and

     - other customary conditions set forth in the merger agreement.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 77)

     The merger agreement may be terminated by the mutual written consent of
Global Marine and Santa Fe International. In addition, either Global Marine or
Santa Fe International may terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the merger has not been completed by March 31, 2002, and the party
       desiring to terminate the merger agreement has not failed to perform or
       observe in any material respect any of its obligations under the merger
       agreement in any manner that caused the merger not to occur on or before
       that date;

     - Global Marine's stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement;

     - Santa Fe International's shareholders fail to approve the issuance of
       Santa Fe International ordinary shares in the merger or the proposed
       amendments to Santa Fe International's memorandum of association,
       including the change of Santa Fe International's name to GlobalSantaFe
       Corporation, and articles of association;

     - a court or governmental authority issues a final order, decree, ruling or
       other action permanently prohibiting the merger, and the party seeking to
       terminate the merger agreement has complied with the covenants in the
       merger agreement which generally relate to antitrust and other
       governmental filings and approvals and, with respect to matters not
       addressed in such covenants, has used its reasonable best efforts to
       remove this injunction, decree or order;

     - the other party materially breaches any representation, warranty,
       covenant or agreement that would give rise to a failure of a condition to
       the merger to be satisfied and the breach is not curable or is not cured
       within 30 days after receipt of a written notice of the breach; or

     - the other party's board withdraws or materially modifies, in a manner
       adverse to the terminating party, its approval or recommendation of the
       proposals to be considered for approval at its shareholder meeting or
       resolves to do so, each as described on page 77.

EXPENSES AND TERMINATION FEES (PAGE 79)

     The merger agreement provides that Santa Fe International or Global Marine
may be required to pay a termination fee of $120 million to the other party
under the circumstances described on page 79. In addition, either party may be
required to pay the other party a fee of $10 million to reimburse the other
party for its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger under
the circumstances described on page 79.

"NO SOLICITATION" PROVISIONS (PAGE 72)

     The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting either party
from seeking an alternative transaction. These "no solicitation" provisions
prohibit either party from taking any action to solicit a competing acquisition
proposal as described on page 72. The merger agreement does not, however,
prohibit either party or its respective board of directors from considering, and
potentially recommending, an unsolicited written superior proposal from a third
party as described on page 73.

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (PAGE 80)

     In order to induce Global Marine to enter into the merger agreement with
Santa Fe International, SFIC Holdings concurrently entered into a shareholder
agreement with Global Marine. SFIC Holdings is a

significant shareholder of Santa Fe International by virtue of its ownership of
43,500,000 ordinary shares, representing approximately 37.7% of the outstanding
Santa Fe International ordinary shares.

     In the shareholder agreement, SFIC Holdings has agreed, subject to certain
conditions, to vote its 43,500,000 Santa Fe International ordinary shares:

     - in favor of the issuance of Santa Fe International ordinary shares
       pursuant to the merger and the amendments to Santa Fe International's
       memorandum of association and articles of association; and

     - against any Santa Fe acquisition proposal or any other transaction or
       proposal that is inconsistent with the transactions contemplated by the
       merger agreement.

     In addition, SFIC Holdings has agreed that it will not solicit or take any
action designed to facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a
competing acquisition proposal with respect to Santa Fe International. SFIC
Holdings has agreed to promptly notify Global Marine of any inquiry or request
for information with respect to, or that could lead to, any competing Santa Fe
acquisition proposal. Kuwait Petroleum Corporation has also agreed to be bound
by the nonsolicitation provisions of the shareholder agreement.

     The shareholder agreement is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. We urge you to read this document carefully.

CONSENT AND AMENDMENT TO INTERCOMPANY AGREEMENT (PAGE 81)

     In connection with the initial public offering of Santa Fe International,
Santa Fe International entered into an intercompany agreement with Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation and SFIC Holdings. The intercompany agreement requires
Santa Fe International to obtain the consent of SFIC Holdings to significant
corporate actions by Santa Fe International, including the issuance of equity
securities, the sale of assets in excess of $50 million, the incurrence of
indebtedness in excess of $250 million or the change of corporate domicile by
Santa Fe International or any of its subsidiaries, until the equity interests of
Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates in Santa Fe International are
reduced to less than 25%. The intercompany agreement also provides for the
management and allocation of specified liabilities relating to Santa Fe
International's former non-drilling activities, the registration of ordinary
shares held by SFIC Holdings and other matters, including advance access to
financial and other information. The registration rights of SFIC Holdings set
forth in the intercompany agreement are not affected by the consent and
amendment to intercompany agreement.

     Upon completion of the merger, SFIC Holdings will hold approximately 18.6%
of the outstanding ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe. In connection with the
merger, Santa Fe International, SFIC Holdings and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation
have entered into a consent and amendment to intercompany agreement. Under the
consent and amendment, SFIC Holdings and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation have
irrevocably consented to the issuance by Santa Fe International of the ordinary
shares contemplated by the merger agreement and the performance by Santa Fe
International of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The consent and amendment limits the requirement for the consent of SFIC
Holdings in connection with significant corporate actions by Santa Fe
International to the requirement for the consent of SFIC Holdings in connection
with the reincorporation of GlobalSantaFe or any existing subsidiary of
GlobalSantaFe or incorporation of a new subsidiary. The consent and amendment
also provides SFIC Holdings the right to designate three representatives to the
GlobalSantaFe board of directors and provides SFIC Holdings rights to access
information concerning Santa Fe International. See "The Consent and Amendment to
Intercompany Agreement" on page 81 for a description of the rights of Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation and SFIC Holdings under the consent and amendment.

     In consideration of SFIC Holdings and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation
executing and delivering the consent and amendment and in recognition of the
direct and indirect expenses incurred by SFIC Holdings in connection with the
consent and amendment, Santa Fe International has agreed to pay SFIC Holdings a
fee of $10 million subject to consummation of the merger.

     The consent and amendment to intercompany agreement is attached as Annex E
to this joint proxy statement prospectus. We urge you to read this document
carefully.

MANAGEMENT OF GLOBALSANTAFE AFTER THE MERGER (PAGE 51)

     Upon completion of the merger, the board of directors of GlobalSantaFe will
manage the business of GlobalSantaFe, including the business of Global Marine.
Global Marine will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE MERGER (PAGE 52)

     In considering the boards' recommendations, shareholders should be aware
that some directors and executive officers of Santa Fe International and Global
Marine have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, those of their respective shareholders generally. These interests generally
include the potential for such persons to occupy positions as directors or
executive officers of GlobalSantaFe, potential benefits under employment or
severance arrangements as a result of the merger, acceleration of vesting of
options or lapse of restrictions on restricted stock as a result of the merger,
severance and other benefit payments in the event the employment of such person
is terminated in connection with the merger, and the right of past and present
officers and directors of Global Marine to continued indemnification from Global
Marine and continued insurance coverage by GlobalSantaFe and Global Marine.

     For example, Robert E. Rose, the current chairman of the board of
directors, president and chief executive officer of Global Marine, will become
the chairman of the board of directors of GlobalSantaFe. C. Stedman Garber, Jr.,
president and chief executive officer of Santa Fe International, will continue
to serve as president and chief executive officer of GlobalSantaFe. Upon
completion of the merger, the board of directors of GlobalSantaFe will consist
of the following 14 directors:

     - Robert E. Rose, Thomas W. Cason, C. Russell Luigs, Edward R. Muller, Paul
       J. Powers, Carroll W. Suggs and John L. Whitmire, each of whom is a
       current director of Global Marine;

     - C. Stedman Garber, Jr., Ferdinand A. Berger, Richard L. George and
       Stephen J. Solarz, each of whom is a current director of Santa Fe
       International; and

     - Nader H. Sultan, Khaled R. Al-Haroon and Maha A.R. Razzuqi, each of whom
       is a current director of Santa Fe International designated by SFIC
       Holdings.

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine will make a payment of $100,000
and $104,000, respectively, to each director who relinquishes his or her
position as a director of Santa Fe International or Global Marine in recognition
of his or her service as a director through the date of the merger. Santa Fe
International will also make a payment of $100,000 to Gordon M. Anderson, who
will resign as a director and relinquish his position as chairman of the board
of directors of Santa Fe International upon completion of the merger, which
payment is in addition to the payment he will receive upon resignation from the
board of directors in recognition of his service through the date of the merger.

     In addition, options and restricted shares granted to directors, officers
and employees of Santa Fe International will become unrestricted, fully vested
and, in the case of options, exercisable upon completion of the merger. Options,
performance shares and other restricted shares granted to directors, officers
and employees of Global Marine will also become unrestricted, fully vested and,
in the case of options, exercisable on or before completion of the merger.
Options to purchase shares of Global Marine common stock will become options to
purchase ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe.

     The executive officers of Global Marine, consisting of Messrs. Rose,
Dawson, Johnson, Krezel, Marshall, McCulloch, Ralls, Stegall, Vrooman and
Woolie, will be entitled to severance benefits in the event of the termination
of their employment without "cause" or in the event of resignation of employment
for "good reason" during the 36-month period following the completion of the
merger.

     The executive officers of Santa Fe International, consisting of Messrs.
Garber, Hunt, McCarty, Moomjian and Seeliger, will generally also be entitled to
severance benefits in the event of termination of

employment without "cause" or in the event of resignation of employment for
"good reason" during the 36-month period following the completion of the merger.

REGULATORY MATTERS (PAGE 65)

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine have made or will make appropriate
filings to obtain clearance of the proposed merger from governmental regulators,
including competition and antitrust authorities in the U.S., the U.K. and
Brazil.

     The applicable waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act was terminated on September 27, 2001; however, such clearance
does not have the effect of conferring immunity against legal or regulatory
challenges against the merger.

     We are working together to obtain the other required regulatory clearances.
Although we have not yet received all of the required clearances, we anticipate
that we will receive regulatory clearances in sufficient time to complete the
merger immediately following the shareholder meetings. However, we can give no
assurance as to when or whether these clearances will be obtained or the terms
and conditions that these consents and clearances may impose.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND CONSIDERATIONS (PAGE 60)

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
As the stockholders of Global Marine will own slightly over 50% of GlobalSantaFe
after the merger, Global Marine will be considered the acquiring entity for
financial accounting purposes. Accordingly, the historical basis of Global
Marine in its assets and liabilities will be carried forward to the financial
statements of GlobalSantaFe. The assets and liabilities of Santa Fe
International will be revalued to estimated fair value at the date of the merger
in the financial statements of GlobalSantaFe, with the excess of the purchase
price over the sum of such fair values recorded as goodwill. The $2.6 billion
purchase price is calculated using the estimated number of Santa Fe
International ordinary shares expected to be outstanding immediately prior to
the merger and a $14.67 per share average trading price of Global Marine common
stock, as adjusted for the merger ratio ($22.06 per share, as adjusted), for a
period of time immediately before and after the merger was announced, plus the
estimated fair value of Santa Fe International's outstanding stock options. The
calculated purchase price is for accounting purposes only and is not indicative
of the price at which Santa Fe International ordinary shares will trade
immediately before the completion of the merger or the value of the
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares to be received by Global Marine stockholders in
the merger.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO SHAREHOLDERS
(PAGE 61)

     Global Marine's Stockholders.  We expect that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the exchange of Global Marine common stock for ordinary shares of
Santa Fe International will cause Global Marine stockholders who are U.S.
persons to be taxed on their gains in connection with the merger but not to be
allowed to recognize a loss. In general, Global Marine stockholders who are not
U.S. persons will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a result of the
merger.

     Santa Fe International's Shareholders.  Because Santa Fe International
ordinary shares remain unchanged, the merger will not cause Santa Fe
International shareholders to recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

     THIS TAX TREATMENT MAY NOT APPLY TO SOME SHAREHOLDERS. DETERMINING THE
ACTUAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER FOR A PARTICULAR SHAREHOLDER MAY BE
COMPLICATED. THE CONSEQUENCES WILL DEPEND ON EACH SHAREHOLDER'S SPECIFIC
SITUATION AND ON VARIABLES NOT WITHIN SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL'S OR GLOBAL
MARINE'S CONTROL. WE URGE EACH SHAREHOLDER TO CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING ANY ESTATE, GIFT, STATE, LOCAL OR
NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 67)

     Shareholders of Santa Fe International and stockholders of Global Marine
will not have any right to an appraisal of the value of their shares in
connection with the merger.

LISTING OF GLOBALSANTAFE ORDINARY SHARES (PAGE 67)

     Santa Fe International will apply to list the ordinary shares to be issued
in connection with the merger on the New York Stock Exchange. All GlobalSantaFe
ordinary shares will trade under the ticker symbol "GSF" upon completion of the
merger.

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS (PAGE 97)

     The rights of Global Marine common stockholders are governed by the
Delaware General Corporation Law and Global Marine's certificate of
incorporation and by-laws. The rights of Santa Fe International shareholders are
governed by the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision) of the Cayman Islands and
Santa Fe International's memorandum of association and articles of association.
When the merger is completed, Santa Fe International shareholders and Global
Marine stockholders will both be shareholders of GlobalSantaFe, and their rights
will be governed by the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision) of the Cayman
Islands and GlobalSantaFe's amended and restated memorandum of association and
amended and restated articles of association.

MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (PAGE 84)

     Santa Fe International ordinary shares and Global Marine common stock are
both listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

     The following table sets forth comparative market price information as of
August 31, 2001, the last trading day before the public announcement of the
merger, and as of October 15, 2001, the most recent day for which information

Santa Fe International and Global Marine share prices represent the closing sale
prices on the New York Stock Exchange on each of the dates indicated.

     The market price of ordinary shares of Santa Fe International and shares of
Global Marine common stock will fluctuate before the merger, but the merger
ratio of 0.665 GlobalSantaFe shares for each share of Global Marine common stock
is fixed. You should obtain current share price quotations for shares of Santa
Fe International and Global Marine.

     Santa Fe International has paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.0325 per
share since the fourth quarter of 1997. On September 11, 2001, the board of
directors of Santa Fe International declared a quarterly dividend of $0.0325 per
share payable to holders of record at the close of business on September 28,
2001. We do not currently plan to change this practice after the merger,
including the amount of the per share dividend payments by GlobalSantaFe after
the merger. Any future declaration and payment of dividends by GlobalSantaFe
will be made at the discretion of its board of directors and will be dependent
upon a variety of factors, including GlobalSantaFe's results of operations,
financial condition, cash requirements, and restrictions, if any, contained in
its agreements with creditors. Any declared dividend will be payable only out of
GlobalSantaFe's profits or share premium account or any other account permitted
by the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision) of the Cayman Islands in accordance
with Cayman Islands law. Global Marine has not paid cash dividends since 1985.

                SELECTED HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

     The following tables present (1) selected historical financial data of
Santa Fe International, (2) selected historical financial data of Global Marine
and (3) selected unaudited pro forma combined financial data of GlobalSantaFe
which reflects the completion of the merger.

                             SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL

                       SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

     Santa Fe International prepared the selected historical consolidated
financial data in the table below using the consolidated financial statements of
Santa Fe International. Effective December 31, 1997, Santa Fe International
changed its year-end for financial reporting purposes from June 30 to December
31. Santa Fe International derived the statement of operations data for each of
the four years ended December 31, 2000, and the balance sheet data as of
December 31 of each year from 1996 to 2000, from its consolidated financial
statements audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors. The statement of
operations data for the year ended December 31, 1996 was derived from financial
statements of Santa Fe International for the years ended June 30, 1997 and 1996,
which were also audited by Ernst & Young LLP. Santa Fe International derived the
statement of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 and
the balance sheet data as of June 30, 2001 and 2000 from its unaudited
consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited
interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000
include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of
operations for these periods. Operating results for the six months ended June
30, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the entire year ending December 31, 2001. The historical data are only a summary
and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements,
related notes and other financial information incorporated by reference in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

(1) The basic net income per ordinary share data for the calendar years ended
    December 31, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 is calculated based on the weighted
    average shares outstanding during the period. The net income per ordinary
    share data for the calendar year ended December 31, 1996 is calculated as
    though the number of shares issued in Santa Fe International's initial
    public offering in 1997, 114,500,000 shares, were outstanding.

(2) Prior to and upon becoming a public company in June 1997, Santa Fe
    International made distributions to its sole shareholder which are not
    reflected as cash dividends.

                                 GLOBAL MARINE

                       SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA

     Global Marine prepared the selected historical financial data in the table
below using the consolidated financial statements of Global Marine. Global
Marine derived the statement of operations data for each of the five years in
the period ended December 31, 2000, and the balance sheet data as of December 31
of each year from 1996 through 2000, from its consolidated financial statements
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants. Global Marine
derived the statement of operations data for the six months ended June 30, 2001
and 2000 and the balance sheet data as of June 30, 2001 and 2000 from its
unaudited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the
unaudited interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2001
and 2000 include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring

(1) In June 2001 Global Marine sold the Glomar Beaufort Sea I concrete island
    drilling system to Exxon Neftegas Limited for $45 million, resulting in a
    pretax gain in the amount of $35.1 million.

(2) In 1999 Global Marine increased the estimated useful lives of certain of its
    drilling rigs. The effect of the change was to increase 1999 income before
    extraordinary item by approximately $17.7 million.

(3) In December 1997 Global Marine redeemed its 12 3/4% senior secured notes at
    a price of 102% of principal, plus accrued interest, and recorded an
    extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment in the amount of $4.5 million, net
    of a $2.4 million income tax benefit.

(4) The net income per share data, as adjusted, have been computed by dividing
    earnings by the product of the weighted average shares, as reported, and the
    merger exchange ratio of 0.665.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information contained in this document and the
documents incorporated by reference, you should carefully consider the following
risk factors before you decide how to vote on the merger-related proposals.

                          RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

THE VALUE OF THE GLOBALSANTAFE ORDINARY SHARES TO BE RECEIVED BY GLOBAL MARINE
STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MERGER WILL FLUCTUATE

     The merger agreement does not contain any provisions for adjustment of the
merger ratio of 0.665 GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares for each share of Global
Marine common stock and does not permit either party to terminate the merger
agreement based upon fluctuations in the market price of the Santa Fe
International ordinary shares or shares of Global Marine common stock before the
completion of the merger. Because no adjustment will be made to the merger
ratio, the market value of the consideration to be received by Global Marine's
stockholders in the merger cannot currently be determined and will vary based
upon the market price of GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares at the time the merger is
completed. In addition, the market value of the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares
retained by shareholders of Santa Fe International upon completion of the merger
cannot currently be determined and will vary based on factors relating to both
Global Marine and Santa Fe International. These variations may be the result of:

     - changes in the business or results of operations of Santa Fe
       International or Global Marine;

     - the prospects for the post-merger operations of GlobalSantaFe;

     - the worldwide supply/demand balance for oil and natural gas and the
       prevailing commodity price environment;

     - the level of drilling activity of Santa Fe International's and Global
       Marine's customers;

     - competition in the drilling industry;

     - regulatory considerations;

     - risks associated with Santa Fe International's construction of new rigs;

     - escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crisis in
       the Middle East or other geographic areas in which Santa Fe International
       or Global Marine operate or further acts of terrorism in the United
       States or elsewhere;

     - the timing of the merger;

     - general stock market and economic conditions; and

     - other factors beyond the control of Santa Fe International or Global
       Marine, including those described elsewhere in this "Risk Factors"
       section.

     Shareholders of both companies are urged to obtain current market
quotations for Global Marine common stock and for Santa Fe International
ordinary shares.

THE PRICE OF GLOBALSANTAFE ORDINARY SHARES MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER

     Assuming the respective merger-related proposals are approved by Santa Fe
International's shareholders and Global Marine's stockholders and the merger is
completed, the number of outstanding GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares will be more
than double the number of outstanding Santa Fe International ordinary shares
immediately prior to the completion of the merger. As a result of the issuance
of a large number of additional shares, the market price of Santa Fe
International ordinary shares prior to the completion of the merger or the
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares following completion of the merger may experience
temporary volatility or decline unrelated to the financial performance of Santa
Fe International, Global Marine or GlobalSantaFe.

GLOBALSANTAFE MAY FACE DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS OF SANTA FE
INTERNATIONAL AND GLOBAL MARINE AND THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER MAY NOT
BE REALIZED

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine currently operate as separate
companies. GlobalSantaFe's proposed management team has no experience running
the combined businesses. Santa Fe International and Global Marine may not be
able to integrate their operations without a loss of employees, customers or
suppliers, a loss of revenues, an increase in operating or other costs or other
difficulties. In addition, GlobalSantaFe may not be able to realize the
operating efficiencies, synergies, cost savings or other benefits expected from
the merger. Any unexpected costs or delays incurred in connection with the
integration could have a material adverse effect on GlobalSantaFe's business,
results of operations or financial condition. GlobalSantaFe expects to incur
charges to earnings relating to restructuring and related expenses in connection
with the merger, the amount of which has not yet been determined.

        RISKS RELATING TO GLOBALSANTAFE'S BUSINESS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AND UNITED STATES MILITARY ACTION COULD RESULT IN A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE BUSINESS OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL, GLOBAL MARINE
OR GLOBALSANTAFE AND AFFECT THE PRICES OF THEIR SHARES

     On September 11, 2001, the United States was the target of terrorist
attacks of unprecedented scope. On October 7, 2001, the United States commenced
military action in Afghanistan in response to these attacks. These developments
have caused instability in the world's financial and insurance markets and will
likely significantly increase political and economic instability in the
geographic areas in which Santa Fe International and Global Marine currently
operate. In addition, these developments will likely lead to increased
volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets
for drilling services. The insurance premiums charged for some or all of the
coverages historically maintained have increased significantly and could
increase further, or the coverages could be unavailable in the future. The
premiums for war risk and terrorism insurance have increased substantially and
Santa Fe International has discontinued war risk and terrorism insurance
coverage on its rigs while Global Marine has elected to pay the increased
premiums. In addition, insurance underwriters have issued general notices of
cancellations to their customers for war risk and terrorism insurance in respect
of a wide variety of insurance coverages, including but not limited to,
liability and aviation coverages. It is presently not known whether underwriters
will offer to reinstate some or all of these coverages and, if reinstatement is
offered, the extent to which the premiums may be increased. Military action by
the United States may continue indefinitely and may escalate and armed
hostilities may begin or escalate in other countries. Further acts of terrorism
in the United States or elsewhere may occur, and such acts of terrorism could be
directed against companies such as ours. United States government regulations
will effectively preclude GlobalSantaFe from actively engaging in business
activities in certain countries, including oil producing countries such as Iran,
Iraq and Libya. These regulations could be amended to cover countries where
Santa Fe International and Global Marine currently operate or where
GlobalSantaFe may wish to operate in the future. These developments will subject
the worldwide operations of both companies to increased risks and, depending on
their magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on the business of Santa
Fe International, Global Marine or GlobalSantaFe and affect the prices of their
shares.

GLOBALSANTAFE'S BUSINESS WILL DEPEND ON THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN THE OIL AND
NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL AND
VOLATILITY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES

     GlobalSantaFe's business will depend on the level of activity in offshore
and onshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production in
markets worldwide. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations of
potential changes in these prices, significantly affect this level of activity.
Worldwide military, political and economic events have contributed to oil and
natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue

to do so in the future. Numerous factors may affect oil and natural gas prices
and the level of demand for GlobalSantaFe's services, including:

     - worldwide demand for oil and natural gas;

     - the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or
       OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;

     - the level of production by non-OPEC countries;

     - domestic and foreign tax policy;

     - laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and
       development of oil and natural gas in various jurisdictions;

     - advances in exploration and development technology; and

     - the worldwide military or political environment, including uncertainty or
       instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed
       hostilities or other crises in the Middle East or other geographic areas
       in which Santa Fe International or Global Marine operates or further acts
       of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere.

GLOBALSANTAFE'S BUSINESS WILL BE HIGHLY PRICE COMPETITIVE AND CYCLICAL, WITH
PERIODS OF LOW DEMAND AND EXCESS RIG AVAILABILITY

     The offshore drilling business is highly competitive with numerous industry
participants. The industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may
experience additional consolidation. Recent mergers among oil and natural gas
exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available
customers.

     Drilling contracts are, for the most part, awarded on a competitive bid
basis. Price competition is often the primary factor in determining which
qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig availability and the quality
and technical capability of service and equipment are also factors.
GlobalSantaFe will compete with numerous offshore drilling contractors, one of
which is larger and has greater resources than GlobalSantaFe. Further,
GlobalSantaFe's drilling management services business will be subject to the
risks associated with having a limited number of customers for its services.

     GlobalSantaFe's industry historically has been cyclical and may be impacted
by oil and natural gas price levels and volatility. There have been periods of
high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates, followed by periods of lower
demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Changes in commodity prices can have
a dramatic effect on rig demand, and periods of excess rig supply intensify the
competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idled. Decreases in
natural gas prices since the beginning of second quarter of 2001 have decreased
the demand for rigs and dayrates in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, a predominantly
natural gas province in which Global Marine has significant operations, as
operators have reduced their level of spending activity. Further declines in oil
or natural gas prices could reduce demand for GlobalSantaFe's drilling services
and adversely affect both utilization and dayrates in one or more of the regions
in which it will operate. GlobalSantaFe may be required to idle rigs or to enter
into lower rate contracts in response to market conditions in the future.

TURNKEY DRILLING OPERATIONS ARE CONTINGENT ON GLOBALSANTAFE'S ABILITY TO WIN
BIDS AND ON RIG AVAILABILITY

     GlobalSantaFe's results of operations from its drilling management services
may be limited by its ability to obtain and successfully perform turnkey
drilling contracts based on competitive bids, as well as other factors. Its
ability to obtain turnkey drilling contracts will largely depend on the number
of these contracts available for bid, which in turn will be influenced by market
prices for oil and natural gas, among other factors. Accordingly, results of
GlobalSantaFe's drilling management service operations may vary widely from
quarter to quarter and from year to year. Furthermore, GlobalSantaFe's ability
to enter into turnkey drilling contracts may be constrained from time to time by
the availability of company-owned or third-party drilling rigs.

TURNKEY DRILLING OPERATIONS EXPOSE GLOBALSANTAFE TO ADDITIONAL RISKS BECAUSE IT
WILL ASSUME THE RISK FOR OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS AND THE CONTRACTS ARE ON A
FIXED-PRICE BASIS

     GlobalSantaFe will have a significant amount of turnkey drilling
operations. In 2000, Global Marine, primarily through its subsidiary Applied
Drilling Technology Inc., or ADTI, completed 149 turnkey drilling projects,
consisting of 122 wells drilled and 27 well completions, and for the first six
months of 2001, completed 72 turnkey projects, consisting of 59 wells drilled
and 13 well completions. GlobalSantaFe's compensation under turnkey contracts
will depend on whether it successfully drills to a specified depth or, under
some of its contracts, completes the well. Unlike dayrate contracts, where
ultimate control is exercised by the operator, GlobalSantaFe will be exposed to
additional risks when serving as a turnkey drilling contractor, because it will
make all critical decisions. Under a turnkey contract, the amount of
GlobalSantaFe's compensation will be fixed at the amount it bids to drill the
well. Thus, it will not be paid if operational problems prevent performance
unless it chooses to drill a new well at its own expense. Further, GlobalSantaFe
must absorb the loss if unforeseen problems arise that cause the cost of
performance to exceed the turnkey price. In contrast, in a dayrate contract,
these risks are generally retained by the customer. Although GlobalSantaFe will
budget for these contingencies, there can be no assurance that the cost of
contingencies will not exceed budgeted amounts. GlobalSantaFe will not be
insured against all of these risks associated with turnkey drilling operations.
See "-- GlobalSantaFe's business will involve numerous operating hazards and it
will not be fully insured against all of them."

     Global Marine's subsidiary ADTI, Patterson Energy Services, Inc. and Eagle
Oilfield Inspection services are defendants in a civil lawsuit filed in
September 2001 by Newfield Exploration Co. and its insurance underwriters in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The lawsuit
arises out of damage caused to an offshore well owned by Newfield which had been
drilled by ADTI in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico pursuant to a turnkey drilling
contract and in respect of which Patterson Services, Inc. and Eagle Oilfield
Inspection Services, Inc. also performed services. The well was damaged
following completion of the turnkey contract when the well head was struck by a
fishing vessel. The plaintiffs allege breach of contract, negligence and breach
of warranty on the part of the defendants, and have sued for damages of
approximately $13,000,000. Global Marine has not made any determination as to
the merits of these claims or the availability of insurance coverage, if any, in
the event ADTI incurs any liability.

FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD IMPEDE OPERATIONS

     GlobalSantaFe requires highly skilled personnel to operate and provide
technical services and support for its business. Competition for the skilled and
other labor required for deepwater and other drilling operations has intensified
as the number of rigs activated or added to worldwide fleets or under
construction has increased in the last few years. GlobalSantaFe will have one
deepwater rig under construction, a firm commitment to build an additional
deepwater rig and options to build up to two more deepwater rigs. GlobalSantaFe
will also have one premium jackup rig under construction, a firm commitment to
build an additional premium jackup and options to build up to four more premium
jackup rigs. GlobalSantaFe must hire full crews for these rigs before they
commence operations in addition to its routine requirements for drilling crews.
Although competition for skilled and other labor has not materially affected
Global Marine or Santa Fe International to date, both companies have recently
found it more difficult to find qualified individuals, and the possibility
exists that competition for skilled and other labor for deepwater and other
operations could limit GlobalSantaFe's results of operations.

GLOBALSANTAFE MAY SUFFER LOSSES IF ITS CUSTOMERS TERMINATE OR SEEK TO
RENEGOTIATE ITS CONTRACTS

     GlobalSantaFe's contracts with customers may be cancellable upon specified
notice at the option of the customer. Some drilling contracts require the
customer to pay a specified early termination payment upon cancellation, which
payments may not fully compensate GlobalSantaFe for the loss of the contract.
Contracts customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at
the option of the customer in the event of total loss of the drilling rig or if
drilling operations are suspended for extended periods of time by reason of acts
of God or excessive rig downtime for repairs, or other specified conditions.
Early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended
period of time. GlobalSantaFe's revenues may be adversely

affected by customers' early termination of contracts, especially if
GlobalSantaFe is unable to recontract the affected rig within a short period of
time. Further, in times of depressed market conditions, Santa Fe International's
and Global Marine's customers have on occasion sought to renegotiate firm
drilling contracts to reduce their obligations.

GLOBALSANTAFE WILL RELY HEAVILY ON A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS

     In the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, 50%, 72% and 68%,
respectively, of Santa Fe International's operating revenue was derived from six
customers. Of the $584 million of operating revenues for the year ended December
31, 2000, approximately 19% were attributable to Santa Fe International's
largest customer and approximately 65% were attributable to its five largest
customers, including 10% contributed by an affiliate of Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation. In the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, 23%, 33% and
29%, respectively, of Global Marine's operating revenues were derived from five
or fewer customers. Of the $1.04 billion of operating revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2000, approximately 29% were attributable to Global Marine's
five largest customers, none of which represented revenues of more than 7%
individually. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2000,
approximately 10% of the pro forma operating revenues for GlobalSantaFe would
have been attributable to the largest customer on a combined basis and
approximately 36% of pro forma operating revenues would have been attributable
to GlobalSantaFe's five largest customers. GlobalSantaFe's results of operations
may be materially adversely affected if any of these customers terminates its
contracts with GlobalSantaFe, fails to renew GlobalSantaFe's existing contracts
or refuses to award new contracts to GlobalSantaFe.

GLOBALSANTAFE'S DEEPWATER SEMISUBMERSIBLE AND PREMIUM JACKUP RIGS THAT ARE OR
WILL BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION WILL BE SUBJECT TO RISKS, INCLUDING DELAYS AND COST
OVERRUNS, AND NO CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN ENTERED INTO YET FOR THEIR DEPLOYMENT UPON
COMPLETION

     GlobalSantaFe will have two rigs under construction, firm commitments to
build two additional rigs and options to build six more rigs for its fleet. In
addition, Santa Fe International and Global Marine have each made upgrade and
refurbishment expenditures for their fleets and expect GlobalSantaFe to do the
same, and GlobalSantaFe may also make substantial expenditures for the
construction of additional new rigs under certain circumstances. Rig upgrade,
refurbishment and construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or
cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including the
following:

     - shortages of materials or skilled labor;

     - unforeseen engineering problems;

     - unanticipated actual or purported change orders;

     - work stoppages;

     - financial or operating difficulties of the shipyard upgrading,
       refurbishing or constructing the rig;

     - adverse weather conditions;

     - unanticipated cost increases; and

     - inability to obtain any of the requisite permits or approvals.

     Significant cost overruns or delays would adversely affect GlobalSantaFe's
financial condition and results of operations.

     None of the four vessels that Santa Fe International has under construction
or has firm commitments to build has secured a contract for deployment upon
completion. Historically, the industry has experienced prolonged periods of
overcapacity, during which many rigs were idle for long periods of time. Neither
Santa Fe International nor Global Marine can assure you that GlobalSantaFe will
be able to obtain contracts for all of its new or existing rigs.

GLOBAL MARINE HAS A CONTRACT DISPUTE ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO DRILLSHIPS
DELIVERED IN 2000

     Global Marine recently completed construction of two dynamically
positioned, ultra-deepwater drillships, the Glomar Jack Ryan and the Glomar C.R.
Luigs. In November 1999, Global Marine agreed to provide

additional funding to the shipbuilder, Harland and Wolff Shipbuilding and Heavy
Industries Limited, because it was concerned about the shipbuilder's financial
viability and satisfactory completion of the two drillships. Global Marine
agreed to advance to the shipbuilder up to approximately $92.6 million above the
contract price amounts, plus up to approximately an additional $12.2 million for
one-half of cost overruns. Global Marine advanced the shipbuilder $103.1 million
in total, including $10.5 million in connection with cost overruns. Global
Marine and the shipbuilder are involved in arbitration proceedings in which the
shipbuilder is asserting claims against Global Marine in connection with cost
overruns in the amount of approximately $195 million. It is unclear whether the
claims include some or all of a steel weight claim in the amount of
approximately $50 million. Final claims should be presented prior to year-end
2001. The agreements under which the advances were made require the shipbuilder
to repay Global Marine any amounts advanced that are in excess of an arbitration
award, if any, in favor of the shipbuilder. Global Marine believes that
repayment of those amounts is doubtful in view of the current financial
condition of the shipbuilder.

GLOBALSANTAFE'S BUSINESS WILL INVOLVE NUMEROUS OPERATING HAZARDS AND IT WILL NOT
BE FULLY INSURED AGAINST ALL OF THEM

     GlobalSantaFe's operations will be subject to the usual hazards incident to
the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including blowouts, explosions, oil
spills and fires. GlobalSantaFe's activities will also be subject to hazards
peculiar to marine operations, such as collision, grounding, and damage or loss
from severe weather. All of these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of
life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or
environmental damage, suspension of operations and wreck removal liabilities.
GlobalSantaFe will insure against, or will have indemnification from customers
for, some, but not all, of these risks. GlobalSantaFe's insurance will contain
various limitations on coverage and deductibles.

     The occurrence of a significant event, including terrorist acts, war, civil
disturbances, pollution or environmental damage, not fully insured or
indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification
obligations, could materially and adversely affect GlobalSantaFe's operations
and financial condition. Moreover, no assurance can be made that GlobalSantaFe
will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers
reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks, particularly in
light of the instability and developments in the insurance markets following the
recent terrorist attacks. Both Global Marine and Santa Fe International have
reduced insurance coverages as a result of the recent disruption in insurance
markets. See "-- Recent terrorist attacks and United States military action
could result in a material adverse effect on the business of Santa Fe
International, Global Marine or GlobalSantaFe and affect the prices of their
shares" on page 18 for further details.

GLOBALSANTAFE'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE ADDITIONAL RISKS NOT ASSOCIATED
WITH DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

     Risks associated with GlobalSantaFe's international operations in non-U.S.
areas, any of which could limit or disrupt GlobalSantaFe's markets or
operations, include risks of:

     - terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances;

     - expropriation or nationalization of assets;

     - renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;

     - foreign exchange restrictions;

     - foreign currency fluctuations;

     - foreign taxation;

     - assaults on property or personnel;

     - limitations on the ability to repatriate income or capital to the U.S.;

     - changing political conditions; and

     - foreign and domestic monetary policies.

     Additionally, GlobalSantaFe's ability to compete in the international
drilling market may be adversely affected by non-U.S. governmental regulations
favoring or requiring the awarding of drilling contracts to local

contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase
supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Furthermore, foreign governmental
regulations, which may in the future become applicable to the oil and natural
gas industry, could reduce demand for GlobalSantaFe's services, or such
regulations could directly affect GlobalSantaFe's ability to compete for
customers.

GLOBALSANTAFE MAY SUFFER LOSSES AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY RISKS

     A majority of GlobalSantaFe's international drilling and services contracts
will be partially payable to it in local currency in amounts that will generally
be intended to approximate its estimated operating costs, with the balance of
the payments under the contract payable in U.S. dollars (except in Kuwait,
Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, where GlobalSantaFe will likely be paid entirely in
local currency). In certain jurisdictions, including Egypt and Nigeria,
regulations exist which determine the amounts which are payable in local
currency. Those amounts can exceed the local currency costs being incurred,
leading to accumulation of excess local currency which in certain instances can
be subject to either temporary blocking or difficulties in converting to U.S.
dollars. To the extent that its revenues denominated in local currency do not
equal its local operating expenses, GlobalSantaFe will be exposed to currency
exchange transaction losses, which could materially and adversely affect its
results of operations and financial condition. Santa Fe International has not
historically entered into financial hedging arrangements to manage risks
relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Global Marine's
international drilling and services contracts have generally all been payable in
U.S. dollars.

LAWS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MAY ADD TO COSTS OR LIMIT DRILLING ACTIVITY

     GlobalSantaFe's business will be affected by changes in public policy and
by federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the energy
industry. The drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil
and natural gas exploration industry and, accordingly, GlobalSantaFe will be
directly affected by the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration
and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental and
other policy reasons. GlobalSantaFe may be required to make significant capital
expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also
possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to
GlobalSantaFe's operating costs or may significantly limit drilling activity.

     Governments in some non-U.S. countries have become increasingly active in
regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, companies holding
concessions, the exploration of oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil
and natural gas industries in these countries. In some areas of the world, this
governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and
development work done by major oil companies and may continue to do so.

COMPLIANCE WITH OR BREACH OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS CAN BE COSTLY AND COULD LIMIT
GLOBALSANTAFE'S OPERATIONS

     The operations of Global Marine and Santa Fe International are subject to
numerous laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the
environment, requiring removal and clean-up of, or otherwise relating to, the
protection of the environment. As a result, the application of these laws could
materially adversely affect GlobalSantaFe's results of operations by increasing
its cost of doing business, discouraging its customers from drilling for
hydrocarbons or subjecting it to liability. For example, as an operator of
mobile offshore drilling units in navigable U.S. waters and some offshore areas,
including the Outer Continental Shelf, GlobalSantaFe may be liable for fines,
damages and for the cost of removing oil spills for which it may be held
responsible. In addition, it may use or handle materials that may be classified
as environmentally hazardous substances as part of its operations. Laws and
regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent, and
may, in some cases, impose "strict liability" for environmental damage. Strict
liability means that GlobalSantaFe may be held liable for damage without regard
to whether it was negligent or at fault. Environmental laws and regulations may
expose GlobalSantaFe to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by
others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time
they were performed.

GLOBAL MARINE MAY BE LIMITED IN ITS USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES

     As of December 31, 2000, Global Marine had approximately $499 million of
net operating loss carryforwards for United States federal income tax purposes.
The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to review and potential
disallowance by the Internal Revenue Service upon audit of its federal income
tax returns. Global Marine can therefore provide no assurance that the full
amount of its net operating loss carryforwards will be allowed. Moreover, Global
Marine can provide no assurance that sufficient future U.S. taxable income will
be available to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards before they
expire. The net operating loss carryforwards are scheduled to expire from 2005
to 2019. However, the expiration and utilization of the net operating loss
carryforwards could be affected by the merger. As a result of the merger,
section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code may limit the future use of the
net operating loss carryforwards if ownership of Global Marine's stock changes
by more than 50% in certain circumstances over a prescribed testing period. It
is possible that the merger would result in such an ownership change. If the
merger does not result in such an ownership change, changes in the ownership of
the GlobalSantaFe stock following the merger could result in such an ownership
change. In the event of an ownership change, the section 382 rules would limit
the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards in each taxable year
ending after the ownership change to an amount equal to a federal long-term
tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service, multiplied by
the fair market value of all of Global Marine's stock at the time of the
ownership change. For this purpose, the value of Global Marine's stock would be
subject to adjustments, including reduction under corporate contraction rules.
GlobalSantaFe may provide a reserve against earnings in future periods to take
into account the potential effect of the risks stated in this paragraph on the
value of the net operating loss carryforwards.

            RISKS RELATED TO OWNING GLOBALSANTAFE'S ORDINARY SHARES

SFIC HOLDINGS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE MATTERS ON WHICH
SHAREHOLDERS MAY VOTE

     SFIC Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation,
which is in turn wholly owned by the State of Kuwait, holds approximately 37.7%
of the outstanding ordinary shares of Santa Fe International. As a result of the
merger, SFIC Holdings will hold approximately 18.6% of the outstanding ordinary
shares of GlobalSantaFe.

     As long as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates own at least
12.5% of the outstanding ordinary shares or at least 12.5% of the outstanding
voting shares, SFIC Holdings will have the right to designate for election three
directors of GlobalSantaFe. If SFIC Holdings' interest is reduced to less than
12.5% and equal to or greater than 7.5%, the number of directors that SFIC
Holdings will have the right to designate for election will be reduced from
three to two. If SFIC Holdings' interest is reduced to less than 7.5% and equal
to or greater than 4%, the number of directors that SFIC Holdings may designate
for election will be reduced from two to one. If SFIC Holdings' interest is
reduced to less than 4%, it will not have the right to designate any directors
for election to the board of GlobalSantaFe. For purposes of determining SFIC
Holdings' ownership interest in GlobalSantaFe, until SFIC Holdings sells any
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares, only ordinary shares outstanding at the
completion of the merger are included in the calculation of the ownership
percentage. Accordingly, reductions in SFIC Holdings' percentage ownership in
GlobalSantaFe as a result of GlobalSantaFe's issuance of shares for any reason
following the merger will not reduce SFIC Holdings' board representation.

     As a result, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, through SFIC Holdings, will be
able to significantly influence the management and affairs of GlobalSantaFe and
all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of the
GlobalSantaFe board of directors. This concentration of ownership could delay or
deter a change of control of GlobalSantaFe.

     Although the owners of all the ordinary shares after the merger will be
entitled to one vote per share, as long as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its
affiliates own at least 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares or at least 10%
of the outstanding voting shares of GlobalSantaFe, the consent of SFIC Holdings
will be required to change the jurisdiction of any existing subsidiary of
GlobalSantaFe or incorporate a new subsidiary in any

jurisdiction in a manner materially adversely affecting the rights or interests
of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation or its affiliates or reincorporate GlobalSantaFe
in another jurisdiction.

SOME OF THE DIRECTORS OF GLOBALSANTAFE ARE ALSO DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS OF KUWAIT
PETROLEUM CORPORATION OR ITS AFFILIATES AND MAY HAVE INTERESTS THAT ARE IN
CONFLICT WITH THE INTERESTS OF OTHER SHAREHOLDERS

     As discussed above, SFIC Holdings will have the right to designate
representatives for election to the GlobalSantaFe board of directors. The
articles of association state that Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its
affiliated companies have no duty to refrain from competing with GlobalSantaFe.
The articles of association also state that Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its
affiliated companies are not under any duty to present corporate opportunities
to GlobalSantaFe in the event of a conflict, and that corporate opportunities
offered to persons who are directors or officers of GlobalSantaFe and of Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation or its affiliates will be allocated based principally on
the capacities in which the individual director or officer is offered the
opportunity. As a result, any director of GlobalSantaFe designated by SFIC
Holdings may have potential or actual conflicts that could affect the process or
outcome of GlobalSantaFe board deliberations.

GLOBALSANTAFE'S SHAREHOLDERS WILL HAVE LIMITED RIGHTS UNDER CAYMAN ISLANDS LAW

     Santa Fe International is, and following its change of name to
GlobalSantaFe Corporation will continue to be, incorporated under the laws of
the Cayman Islands, and its corporate affairs will be governed by its memorandum
of association and its articles of association and by the Companies Law (2001
Second Revision) of the Cayman Islands. Principles of law relating to matters
such as the validity of corporate procedures, the fiduciary duties of
management, directors and controlling shareholders and the rights of
shareholders differ from those that would apply if GlobalSantaFe were
incorporated in a jurisdiction within the United States. Further, the rights of
shareholders under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as the
rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent applicable in
most U.S. jurisdictions. As a result, GlobalSantaFe's shareholders may have more
difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by the
management or directors than they might have as shareholders of a corporation
incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, there is doubt as to whether
the courts of the Cayman Islands would enforce, either in an original action or
in an action for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, liabilities that are
predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws. See "Comparison of Rights of
Shareholders" on page 97.

            THE SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to the
shareholders of Santa Fe International in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by Santa Fe International's board of directors with respect to the
proposed merger with Global Marine.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

     The extraordinary general meeting of Santa Fe International shareholders is
scheduled to be held as follows:

     November 20, 2001

     9:00 a.m., Central Time

     Doubletree Hotel Lincoln Centre

     Skybridge Room II

     5410 LBJ Freeway

     Dallas, Texas 75240

PURPOSE OF THE SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

     At the extraordinary general meeting, Santa Fe International's board of
directors will ask its shareholders to vote on the proposals to approve:

     - The issuance of ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe in connection with the
       merger, in which holders of Global Marine common stock will be entitled
       to receive 0.665 ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe for each share of
       Global Marine common stock they own.

     - The change of Santa Fe International's name to "GlobalSantaFe
       Corporation" and the amended and restated memorandum of association of
       Santa Fe International set forth as Annex F to this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus. See "Santa Fe International's Proposal to Change
       its Name and to Amend its Memorandum of Association" on page 117 for a
       description of the amendments to the memorandum of association of Santa
       Fe International to be made in connection with the merger.

     - The amended and restated articles of association of Santa Fe
       International set forth as Annex G to this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus. See "Santa Fe International's Proposal to Amend its
       Articles of Association" on page 117 for a description of the amendments
       to the articles of association of Santa Fe International to be made in
       connection with the merger.

     The implementation of these proposals is conditional upon the completion of
the merger. All of the proposals must be approved in order for the merger or any
of the proposals to be effected. A vote against any proposal has the same effect
as a vote against all of the proposals.

     SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT
THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT ARE
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS, AND
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF SANTA FE
INTERNATIONAL ORDINARY SHARES PURSUANT TO THE MERGER, THE CHANGE OF SANTA FE
INTERNATIONAL'S NAME TO GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
MEMORANDUM OF ASSOCIATION OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL AND THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL.

RECORD DATE AND VOTING POWER

     The Santa Fe International board of directors has fixed the close of
business on October 15, 2001 as the record date for determination of
shareholders who are entitled to notice of and who are entitled to vote at the
extraordinary general meeting. At the close of business on the record date for
the meeting, there were outstanding 115,485,819 Santa Fe International ordinary
shares. Each ordinary share of Santa Fe

International is entitled to one vote at the extraordinary general meeting with
respect to each matter to be acted upon.

     Only holders of record of Santa Fe International ordinary shares on the
record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the extraordinary general
meeting.

QUORUM

     Shareholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares
of Santa Fe International entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting
must be present, in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the
extraordinary general meeting. Abstentions are counted as present for
establishing a quorum. Because of the nature and interrelationship of the
matters voted on, and because there is no other matter to be voted on, there
will be no "broker non-votes." "Broker non-votes" are proxies submitted by
brokers that do not include a vote for a proposal because they do not have
discretionary voting authority and have not received instructions as to how to
vote on the proposal.

REQUIRED VOTE

     The articles of association of Santa Fe International provide that all
resolutions put to a vote at any general meeting be decided on a poll (rather
than a show of hands of those present or attending by proxy) taken in such
manner as the chairman directs. Assuming the presence of a quorum, the following
shareholder votes are required to approve the indicated proposals at the
extraordinary general meeting:

                  PROPOSAL                                   VOTE 'FOR' REQUIRED
                  --------                                   -------------------

1. Approval of issuance of Santa Fe              - on a poll, holders of a majority of the
   International ordinary shares in                ordinary shares present in person or by
  connection with the merger                       proxy at the meeting and voting on the
                                                   proposal, provided that holders of a
                                                   majority of the ordinary shares entitled
                                                   to vote on the proposal actually vote

3. Approval of the amended and restated          - on a poll, holders of two-thirds of the
   articles of association of Santa Fe             ordinary shares present in person or by
  International                                    proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote
                                                   on the proposal

     Approval of the issuance of Santa Fe International ordinary shares in the
merger, the change of Santa Fe International's name to "GlobalSantaFe
Corporation" and the amended and restated memorandum of association of Santa Fe
International and the amended and restated articles of association of Santa Fe
International is conditional upon the completion of the merger and will be
implemented only if the merger is completed.

     The directors and executive officers of Santa Fe International have
indicated that they intend to vote their shares in favor of all of the
proposals. On the record date, directors and executive officers of Santa Fe
International beneficially owned less than one percent of the outstanding
ordinary shares of Santa Fe International, excluding outstanding options. In
addition, SFIC Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation, owns 43,500,000 ordinary shares of Santa Fe International,
representing approximately 37.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Santa Fe
International. SFIC Holdings has authorized Nader H. Sultan and Maha A.R.
Razzuqi to vote these shares on behalf of SFIC Holdings in person or by proxy at
the extraordinary general meeting. Nader H. Sultan and Maha A.R. Razzuqi are
both directors of Santa Fe International and have both disclaimed beneficial
ownership of such ordinary shares. SFIC Holdings has entered into a shareholder
agreement with Global Marine, in which SFIC Holdings has agreed, subject to
certain conditions, to vote all of the 43,500,000 ordinary shares owned by it in
favor of the Santa Fe International proposals.

PROXIES

     All ordinary shares represented at the extraordinary general meeting by
properly executed proxy cards will be voted in accordance with the instructions
indicated on the proxy cards. If no instructions are indicated, the proxies will
be voted "FOR" approval of each proposal. If any other matters are properly
presented at the extraordinary general meeting for action, the proxies will have
discretion to vote.

     Santa Fe International's shareholders may abstain on any or all of the
proposals, by marking "ABSTAIN" with respect to any or all of the proposals.

     The following table shows the effect that a proxy without instructions or
an abstention will have on the votes on Santa Fe International's proposals:

                               EFFECT ON VALIDITY OF PROPOSAL VOTES
                                      (QUORUM REQUIREMENTS)           EFFECT ON PROPOSAL VOTES
                               ------------------------------------   ------------------------

PROXY WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS          Vote counted "FOR" quorum             Vote "FOR" proposal
ABSTENTION                          Vote counted "FOR" quorum         Vote "AGAINST" proposal(a)

---------------

(a) An abstention, while appearing to be a vote neither in favor of nor against
    a proposal, actually constitutes a vote against a proposal, because it
    effectively eliminates a potential vote "FOR" the proposal.

     Santa Fe International's shareholders of record may use the accompanying
proxy card if they are unable or do not wish to attend the extraordinary general
meeting in person or if they wish to have their shares voted by proxy even
though they do attend the meeting.

     Santa Fe International's shareholders of record may revoke their proxy at
any time before it is voted by any of the following action:

     (i)  delivering a written notice revoking their proxy to the Secretary of
          Santa Fe International at Two Lincoln Centre, Suite 1100, 5420 LBJ
          Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75240-2648, before or at the meeting;

     (ii)  delivering a later-dated, executed proxy card relating to the same
           shares; or

     (iii) attending the meeting, notifying the Secretary and voting by ballot
           in person; however, if a Santa Fe International shareholder attends
           the meeting but does not vote in person, that shareholder's proxy
           will still be voted.

     Beneficial holders of Santa Fe International's ordinary shares should

International will, upon request, reimburse those brokerage houses and
custodians for their reasonable related expenses. Santa Fe International has
retained Mellon Investor Services LLC for a fee of $12,500, plus expenses, to
aid in the solicitation of proxies and to verify certain records related to the
solicitations. To the extent necessary in order to ensure sufficient
representation at its extraordinary general meeting, Santa Fe International or
its proxy solicitor may request the return of proxy cards or voting instructions
by personal interview, mail, telephone, facsimile or other means of electronic
transmission. The extent to which this will be necessary depends upon how
promptly proxy cards or voting instructions are returned. Santa Fe International
urges its shareholders to send in their proxy cards or voting instructions
without delay.

     YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN ANY SHARE CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD OR
VOTING INSTRUCTIONS.

               THE SPECIAL MEETING OF GLOBAL MARINE STOCKHOLDERS

JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to the
stockholders of Global Marine in connection with the solicitation of proxies by
Global Marine's board of directors with respect to the proposed merger with
Santa Fe International.

DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

     The special meeting of stockholders of Global Marine is scheduled to be
held as follows:

     November 20, 2001

     9:00 a.m., Central Time

     777 N. Eldridge Parkway

     12th Floor

     Houston, Texas

     GLOBAL MARINE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF GLOBAL
MARINE'S STOCKHOLDERS, AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

RECORD DATE AND VOTING POWER

     Global Marine's board of directors has fixed the close of business on
October 15, 2001 as the record date for determination of stockholders who are
entitled to notice of and who are entitled to vote at the special meeting. At
the close of business on the record date for the meeting, there were issued and
outstanding 176,621,576 shares of Global Marine common stock, all of one class.
Each of your shares of Global Marine common stock is entitled to one vote at the
special meeting with respect to each matter to be voted upon.

QUORUM

     If a majority of the outstanding shares as of the record date are present
in person or by proxy at the meeting, a quorum will exist. Abstentions are
counted as present for establishing a quorum. Because of the nature of the
matter voted on, and because there is no other matter to be voted on, there will
be no "broker non-votes." "Broker non-votes" are proxies submitted by brokers
that do not indicate a vote for a proposal because they do not have
discretionary voting authority and have not received instructions as to how to
vote on the proposal.

REQUIRED VOTE

     The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the holders of shares of
Global Marine common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special
meeting is required to adopt the merger agreement. Because adoption of the
merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority
of the shares of Global Marine common stock outstanding as of the record date,
abstentions and failures to vote will have the same effect as votes against
adoption of the merger agreement.

PROXIES

     All shares represented at the special meeting by properly executed proxies
will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. If
no instructions are indicated, the proxies will be voted FOR approval and
adoption of the merger agreement. If any other matters are properly presented at
the special meeting for action, the proxy holders will have discretion to vote.
Global Marine's board of directors does not know of any other matters to be
brought before the special meeting.

     You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by any of the
following actions: (i) notifying the Corporate Secretary in writing any time
before it is voted; (ii) submitting a subsequent proxy; or (iii) voting in

person at the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting will not, in
and of itself, constitute a revocation of a proxy. Any written notice revoking a
proxy should be sent to the Corporate Secretary at Global Marine's principal
executive offices, 777 N. Eldridge Parkway, Houston, Texas 77079-4493.

the ADP program, you may vote those shares telephonically by calling the

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     The managements of Santa Fe International and Global Marine have
continually reviewed their respective company's position in light of the
changing environment of the drilling industry, with the objective of identifying
and acting on opportunities that may be available to further enhance shareholder
value. While each management believes that its respective company has positive
future prospects on a stand-alone basis, in recent years the managements of both
Santa Fe International and Global Marine have had confidential conversations
with the managements of certain other companies to explore opportunities to
improve their competitive positions, including by means of acquisitions and
dispositions of assets, possible partnerships, alliances, business combinations
or other strategic transactions.

     Preliminary discussions regarding a possible business combination between
Santa Fe International and Global Marine have been held intermittently over many
years. At the end of August 1999, C. Stedman Garber, Jr., chief executive
officer and president of Santa Fe International, contacted Robert E. Rose,
chairman, chief executive officer and president of Global Marine, to determine
his company's interest in considering a possible strategic combination of the
two companies.

     On September 9, 1999, Mr. Garber and Mr. Rose met and discussed the
possibility of a transaction involving Santa Fe International and Global Marine,
focusing on the strategic rationale behind such a transaction. The two companies
tentatively agreed to enter into a confidentiality and standstill agreement and
to exchange certain financial data at some future date.

     On February 25, 2000, Mr. Garber and Mr. Rose met again to discuss a
potential transaction. The parties entered into a confidentiality and standstill
agreement on March 2, 2000. On March 14, 2000, Seals M. McCarty, senior vice
president and chief financial officer of Santa Fe International, and W. Matt
Ralls, senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer of Global
Marine, and other management representatives for both companies met to discuss
the possibility of combining the two companies.

     The Santa Fe International board met on March 28, 2000. One of the subjects
discussed at the meeting was a possible combination between Santa Fe
International and Global Marine. Mr. Garber discussed the advantages and
disadvantages of such a combination. The board directed the management of Santa
Fe International to discontinue substantive merger discussions with Global
Marine while maintaining an open line of communications. Pursuant to the initial
confidentiality and standstill agreement, the parties disposed of the data they
had received thereunder.

     On August 22, 2000, Mr. Garber and Mr. Rose met to explore strategic
alternatives to a merger of the two companies, including a possible joint
venture.

     Mr. Garber and Mr. Rose met again on February 14, 2001 and discussed, among
other things, the possibility of reopening merger discussions.

     On February 27, 2001, the Global Marine board held a regularly scheduled
meeting. The Global Marine board had been updated on a number of prior occasions
as to the status of discussions between Global Marine and Santa Fe
International, as well as discussions between Global Marine and other industry
participants, and

as to the conditions in the industry generally. At the February meeting, Mr.
Rose presented information to the board about the business of Santa Fe
International, the potential benefits of a transaction involving the two
companies, the position a combined company would have in the marketplace, and
various financial measures relevant to a possible transaction.

     On April 4, 2001 Mr. Garber reported to the Santa Fe International board at
its regular meeting that Global Marine continued to be interested in pursuing a
possible merger of the companies.

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine entered into a second
confidentiality and standstill agreement on May 10, 2001, and Santa Fe
International's board was advised of Global Marine's heightened level of
interest in once again exploring a combination of the two companies during a
regular meeting on May 15, 2001.

     On May 30, 2001, Messrs. Garber, Rose, McCarty and Ralls met. At that
meeting, the representatives of the two companies discussed general terms of a
possible business combination and discussed the types of preliminary information
which each would require in order to perform an initial analysis of a possible
transaction. Following the meeting, the companies began to exchange limited data
pursuant to the confidentiality and standstill agreement to allow for a more
detailed analysis of a potential transaction.

     On June 8, 2001, Mr. McCarty and Mr. Ralls met, together with other senior
executives of Santa Fe International and Global Marine, as well as
representatives of tax advisors for Santa Fe International and tax advisors for
Global Marine. At that meeting, the participants had further preliminary
discussions regarding the possibility of a combination of the two companies,
including discussions of potential synergies and tax structure.

     The Santa Fe International board met on July 9th and 10th, 2001. After a
discussion of various issues concerning a potential transaction between Santa Fe
International and Global Marine, the board concluded that it would be prudent to
continue discussions with Global Marine to determine whether the two parties
would be able to reach an agreement. On July 10, 2001, Santa Fe International
decided to retain Credit Suisse First Boston as its financial adviser in
connection with a possible transaction with Global Marine.

     On July 13, 2001, Mr. Garber called Mr. Rose to inform him about the
discussions regarding the potential combination that occurred in the July 9th
and 10th board meeting of Santa Fe International.

     On July 16, 2001, Mr. Rose sent Mr. Garber an outline of terms of a
potential merger of equals transaction between the parties.

     On July 17, 2001, Global Marine retained Morgan Stanley as its financial
advisor in connection with a possible transaction with Santa Fe International.
Morgan Stanley met with representatives of Global Marine on a number of
occasions thereafter either in person or by telephone to advise with respect to
the transaction.

     On July 24, 2001, Mr. McCarty and Mr. Ralls, as well as another management
representative from Santa Fe International, met to discuss possible valuations
for the companies, valuation methodologies and earnings estimates. The
participants also discussed the estimated savings and possible synergies of the
transaction. Over the next several weeks, the management, employees and the
legal and financial representatives of Santa Fe International and Global Marine
continued to analyze financial information, exchanged materials and conducted
due diligence.

     On August 2, 2001, Mr. Rose telephoned Mr. Garber to discuss the status of
the proposed transaction. During the conversation, Mr. Garber agreed that Santa
Fe International and its outside counsel, Shearman & Sterling, would review
Global Marine's initial draft of the merger agreement, which was furnished by
Global Marine's outside counsel, Baker Botts L.L.P., to Santa Fe International
the next day. On August 6, 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Smith
Barney, financial advisor to Santa Fe International's largest shareholder,
Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, met to discuss the proposed transaction.

     On August 15 and 16, 2001, the Global Marine board held a meeting and
discussed, among other things, the possibility of a transaction with Santa Fe
International. At this regularly scheduled meeting, senior executives of Global
Marine and representatives of Baker Botts and Morgan Stanley were present. The
board

was updated on the status of the discussions with Santa Fe International by Mr.
Rose. Representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the financial aspects of a
possible combination of Global Marine and Santa Fe International. Management of
Global Marine advised the board regarding the status of the ongoing due
diligence investigation, and Baker Botts advised the board regarding various
matters. The Global Marine board authorized management to continue to negotiate
with Santa Fe International, and gave Mr. Rose its view as to various business
issues in the negotiations.

     A series of meetings were held on August 22 and 23, 2001, at which
executives of Santa Fe International and Global Marine and each of their legal
and financial advisors discussed due diligence matters and business and
operational issues related to the transaction. Representatives of Salomon Smith
Barney also attended these meetings on behalf of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.

     On August 26, 2001, the Santa Fe International board held a special meeting
by telephone to discuss the preliminary proposed terms of the merger with Global
Marine. At this meeting, senior executives of Santa Fe International as well as
representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, legal advisors for
Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and SFIC Holdings, Shearman & Sterling and Credit
Suisse First Boston were present. After being advised regarding various matters
by Shearman & Sterling, the board was updated on the status of the negotiations
with Global Marine. Following deliberations, the board instructed management to
continue to negotiate with Global Marine.

     On August 26, 2001, shortly after the Santa Fe International board meeting,
executives of Santa Fe International and Global Marine, together with their
respective financial advisors, discussed the structure of the transaction and
their respective views of the business prospects for each company and the
combined company.

     On August 28, 2001, Mr. Garber and Mr. Rose met and reviewed the principal
terms of the proposed transaction and agreed to recommend to their respective
boards a merger ratio of 0.665 ordinary shares of Santa Fe International for
each share of Global Marine common stock.

     During that week, representatives of Santa Fe International, Global Marine
and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and their respective legal counsel discussed
and negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related documents. In
addition, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, Global Marine and their respective legal
counsel discussed and negotiated the terms of the shareholder agreement.

     On August 31, 2001, the board of directors of Santa Fe International
conducted a special meeting to consider the proposed transaction. At this
meeting, Mr. Garber and other members of management reviewed the transaction
with the board, including the strategic reasons for the proposed transaction,
the principal terms of the proposed transaction, a financial review of the
proposed transaction, a review of Global Marine's financial condition and
business operations and the results of Santa Fe International's due diligence
review.

     During the August 31, 2001 board meeting, Santa Fe International's internal
legal counsel and representatives of Shearman & Sterling made a presentation
concerning the proposed transaction, including the merger agreement, the
proposed amendments to the memorandum of association and articles of association
and the consent and amendment to intercompany agreement. In addition, Credit
Suisse First Boston reviewed its financial analysis of the merger ratio provided
for in the merger and rendered to Santa Fe International's board an oral
opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
August 31, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to
the matters described in its opinion, the merger ratio of 0.665 was fair, from a
financial point of view, to Santa Fe International. Upon completing its
deliberations, the board of directors of Santa Fe International unanimously
approved the merger agreement and the related agreements and the transactions
contemplated by those agreements. The board of directors resolved to recommend
that Santa Fe International's shareholders approve (i) the issuance of Santa Fe
International ordinary shares pursuant to the merger, (ii) the proposed amended
and restated articles of association and (iii) the proposed amended and restated
memorandum of association, together with the change of Santa Fe International's
name to GlobalSantaFe Corporation.

     Also on August 31, 2001, the board of directors of Global Marine met to
consider the proposed transaction. At this meeting, Messrs. Rose and Ralls and
other members of management reviewed the transaction with the board, including
the strategic reasons for the proposed transaction, the principal terms of the
proposed transaction, a financial review of the proposed transaction, a review
of Santa Fe International's financial condition and business operations and the
results of Global Marine's due diligence review.

     Representatives of Baker Botts and Morgan Stanley made presentations to
Global Marine's board concerning the proposed transaction. During its
presentation, Morgan Stanley rendered to Global Marine's board an oral opinion,
which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 31,
2001, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to the
matters described in the opinion, the merger ratio of 0.665 was fair, from a
financial point of view, to holders of Global Marine common stock. The board of
directors of Global Marine then met in executive session. Upon completing its
deliberations, the board of directors of Global Marine unanimously determined
that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable and in the best interests
of Global Marine's stockholders, approved the merger agreement and the related
agreements and the merger and the other transactions contemplated by those
agreements. The board of directors also unanimously resolved to recommend that
Global Marine's stockholders approve and adopt the merger agreement.

     After negotiation of the final terms of the merger agreement and related
agreements, representatives of Santa Fe International and representatives of
Global Marine executed the agreements during the evening of Friday, August 31,
2001. At that time, Santa Fe International, SFIC Holdings and the Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation also executed the consent and amendment to intercompany
agreement. In addition, SFIC Holdings and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation executed
the shareholder agreement with Global Marine.

     On Monday, September 3, 2001, Santa Fe International and Global Marine
issued a joint press release announcing the proposed transaction.

SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     The Santa Fe International board of directors believes that the merger will
expand and enhance the drilling fleets of the two companies and thus better
position GlobalSantaFe to address the growing and more technically challenging
needs of its customers on a global basis and provide its customers with
consistently high quality service in all key drilling areas of the world. The
Santa Fe International board of directors believes that GlobalSantaFe will be
the premier worldwide contract driller with the breadth and depth necessary to
compete vigorously in today's international oil and natural gas drilling
marketplace.

     In reaching its conclusion to approve the merger, Santa Fe International's
board of directors consulted with members of management and Santa Fe
International's legal and financial advisors and considered many factors,
including the following material factors:

     - Following the merger, GlobalSantaFe will own, operate or manage more than
       100 rigs, consisting of a highly versatile fleet including premium
       jackups, standard jackups, heavy duty harsh environment (HDHE) jackups,
       deepwater drillships, semisubmersible rigs, platform rigs and land rigs.
       This will represent the second largest fleet of mobile offshore drilling
       units in the world, the largest fleet of premium jackups in the world,
       the second largest jackup fleet in the industry, the third largest fleet
       of floating drilling rigs in the world and one of the industry's
       youngest, most technologically advanced drilling fleets.

     - The merger is expected to extend Santa Fe International's operating and
       marketing presence to major offshore operating areas where it does not
       currently operate or has a small presence, including West Africa and
       South America (including the Caribbean area), and will add an established
       operating base and a significant presence in the world's largest offshore
       drilling market, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The increased infrastructure in
       these areas should enable GlobalSantaFe to meet its customers' needs on a
       global basis, should provide greater flexibility to deploy rigs into any
       market worldwide, may provide regional economies of scale and should
       reduce the possible impact of any future downturn in a single geographic
       area. Santa Fe International believes that customers want a larger scope
       of services, and

       prefer to purchase services from larger vendors. Since GlobalSantaFe
       would offer a combination of two of the highest quality drillers in the
       industry, the combined company should be able to respond to customers
       that are moving toward long-term strategic alliances with preferred
       service providers.

     - GlobalSantaFe's pro forma financial statements, as of June 30, 2001,
       reflect a total book equity of approximately $4.0 billion, total debt of
       approximately $925 million and approximately $517 million in cash.
       GlobalSantaFe's pro forma ratio of consolidated debt to total
       capitalization as of June 30, 2001 would be 18.8%, which is the lowest in
       the industry. Santa Fe International's board of directors believes the
       combined company will have a strong balance sheet which may result in a
       higher credit rating than either company would have on a stand-alone
       basis. The strong balance sheet is expected to allow GlobalSantaFe to
       readily serve its customers' requirements, minimize the financial strain
       of any downturn in the industry and enable it to invest in order to
       accelerate growth during up-cycles in the industry.

     - The effect of the merger on cash flow per share, cash earnings per share
       and earnings per share of GlobalSantaFe as compared to Santa Fe
       International on a stand-alone basis. In particular, Santa Fe
       International expects that the proposed merger will be accretive to cash
       earnings per share and earnings per share.

     - The merger ratio of 0.665 and the fact that Santa Fe International
       shareholders will own slightly less than 50% of GlobalSantaFe.

     - Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, which owns approximately 37.7% of the
       outstanding ordinary shares of Santa Fe International through SFIC
       Holdings, agreed to enter into a shareholder agreement with Global Marine
       agreeing, subject to certain conditions, to vote in favor of the Santa Fe
       International merger-related proposals, as well as the consent and
       amendment to intercompany agreement with Santa Fe International. See "The
       Shareholder Agreement" on page 80 and "The Consent and Amendment to
       Intercompany Agreement" on page 81.

     - Following the merger, the Santa Fe International board of directors
       expects potential cost savings to be achievable through elimination of
       duplicative overhead and redundant shore-based facilities and increased
       purchasing power in areas such as operating materials and supplies and
       capital equipment. The annual savings is estimated at $25 million.

     - The tax aspects of the merger, including the expectation that the merger
       will be tax-free to Santa Fe International and its shareholders and that,
       after the merger, tax savings may be achieved by reason of the fact that
       Santa Fe International is a Cayman Islands company and that the
       additional earnings, currently attributable to Global Marine, generated
       outside the United States may be subject to an effective corporate tax
       rate which is lower than the U.S. rate, to which Global Marine is
       currently subject.

     - GlobalSantaFe's board, after the transaction, will be composed of 14
       directors. Seven of these directors will be designated by Santa Fe
       International with three of these seven designees will be selected by
       Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. The executive officers of GlobalSantaFe
       will include C. Stedman Garber, Jr. as president and chief executive
       officer and Seals M. McCarty as executive vice president -- finance and
       administration.

     - The financial presentation of Credit Suisse First Boston delivered on
       August 31, 2001, including its oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed
       by delivery of a written opinion dated August 31, 2001, to the Santa Fe
       International board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial
       point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger ratio
       provided for in the merger, as more fully described below under the
       caption "-- Opinion of Santa Fe International's Financial Advisor."

     - The challenges and potential costs of combining and integrating the
       businesses, and the attendant risks of not achieving expected cost and
       tax savings.

     - The risks to be assumed in the merger in general, including risks
       associated with Global Marine's turnkey drilling operations. In
       particular, the Santa Fe International board of directors considered the

risks inherent to the pending claims of Harland and Wolff Shipbuilding and Heavy
Industries Limited against Global Marine arising out of the construction and
delivery of the deepwater drillships Glomar C.R. Luigs and Glomar Jack Ryan.

     - The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the fact that
       the merger ratio is fixed, the covenants applicable to each party, the
       conditions to completion of the merger, including required regulatory
       clearances, the rights of the parties to the merger agreement, under
       specified circumstances, to respond to, evaluate and negotiate with
       respect to other business combination proposals, the circumstances under
       which the merger agreement could be terminated and the size and impact of
       termination fees associated with a termination.

     - The terms and conditions of the consent and amendment to intercompany
       agreement and the proposed amended and restated articles of association.

     In determining that the merger is in the best interest of Santa Fe
International's shareholders, the board of directors of Santa Fe International
considered the enumerated factors as a whole and did not quantify or otherwise
assign relative weights to the different factors or determine that any factor
was of particular importance. The Santa Fe International board of directors
views its recommendation as being based on the totality of the information
presented to and considered by it. The Santa Fe International board of directors
considered all these factors and determined that these factors, as a whole,
supported the conclusions and recommendations described below. Individual
directors may have given different weights to different factors. Moreover, the
foregoing discussion of the reasons for the merger is not intended to be
exhaustive.

     In considering the recommendation of the Santa Fe International board of
directors to approve the issuance of Santa Fe International ordinary shares
pursuant to the merger, the change of Santa Fe International's name to
GlobalSantaFe and the amended and restated memorandum of association of Santa Fe
International, and the amended and restated articles of association of Santa Fe
International, Santa Fe International shareholders and Global Marine
stockholders should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of
Santa Fe International have interests in the proposed merger that are different
from and in addition to the interests of Santa Fe International shareholders
generally. The Santa Fe International board of directors was aware of these
interests and considered them in unanimously approving the merger agreement and
the merger. See "Interests of Certain Santa Fe International Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" on page 52.

RECOMMENDATION OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT
THE MERGER AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT ARE
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS, AND
UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF SANTA FE
INTERNATIONAL ORDINARY SHARES PURSUANT TO THE MERGER, THE CHANGE OF SANTA FE
INTERNATIONAL'S NAME TO GLOBALSANTAFE CORPORATION AND THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
MEMORANDUM OF ASSOCIATION OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL AND THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL.

GLOBAL MARINE'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

     The board of directors of Global Marine believes that the merger represents
a powerful combination of complementary premium equipment, expertise and
geographic presence that will serve to retain and attract customers worldwide,
increase operating leverage and flexibility and enhance the ability of the
combined company to withstand industry and regional fluctuations.

     In reaching its conclusion to approve the merger and the merger agreement,
Global Marine's board of directors consulted with members of management and its
financial and legal advisors and considered many factors, including the
following material factors:

     - GlobalSantaFe will be the second largest drilling contractor in the
       world, and will own or operate a fleet of over 100 rigs. The combined
       company will have a diversified fleet of 13 floating rigs, 45 jackups, 31
       land rigs and one platform rig, and will operate 13 additional rigs owned
       by others. As a result of its

       increased operational scale and scope, GlobalSantaFe will have a more
       diversified revenue base and be better positioned to meet the full range
       of its customers' drilling needs.

     - With the exception of the North Sea, there is relatively little overlap
       in the geographic operations of the two companies. GlobalSantaFe will
       have strong presence and established operations in each of the world's
       key drilling markets, increasing its flexibility to redeploy assets where
       opportunities exist and respond to its customers' needs on a global
       basis. In addition, this geographic diversity will make GlobalSantaFe's
       results of operations less vulnerable to fluctuations in the conditions
       in the varying regions in which Global Marine now operates, such as the
       U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Because all of Santa Fe International's operations
       are located outside the United States, the combined company will have a
       higher portion of its assets in international markets as compared to
       Global Marine, and could thus benefit from the earnings stability
       generally associated with longer-term contracts typically seen in
       international markets.

     - GlobalSantaFe will have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, with
       pro forma debt to total capitalization of less than 19%. As a result,
       GlobalSantaFe should be well positioned to undertake internal and
       external growth opportunities and have greater ability to weather
       industry cyclicality.

     - The most significant customers of Global Marine are large, integrated oil
       companies. These companies have undergone significant consolidation over
       the last several years, resulting in customers with worldwide needs for
       drilling services and increased bargaining leverage. The Global Marine
       board believes that the greater range of assets and geographic presence,
       flexibility and financial strength of GlobalSantaFe will allow it to
       provide service commensurate with the increasing demands of these
       customers.

     - The operating philosophies and cultures of the two companies are similar,
       and the Global Marine board believes that this compatibility will assist
       in a smooth transition and enhance customer service going forward.

     - Santa Fe International's rigs under construction or subject to a firm
       commitment to build are well suited for Global Marine's established
       operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. While in the past Global Marine
       has not undertaken construction of rigs unless the company had a contract
       to deploy the rigs when completed, after considering the financial
       strength of the combined company and the technical capabilities planned
       for the Santa Fe International newbuilds, the Global Marine board
       believes that the newbuilds will address potentially underserved segments
       of the drilling markets and that the combined company will be
       well-positioned to deploy these assets. Moreover, GlobalSantaFe's fleet
       will be one of the industry's youngest, most technologically advanced
       drilling fleets. These newbuild premium assets will enhance the combined
       company's long-term prospects.

     - By drawing on the strengths and management of both companies,
       GlobalSantaFe will have significant combined expertise that should
       enhance its competitiveness and ability to serve customers. Particularly
       attractive is the combination of Santa Fe's expertise in heavy-duty harsh
       environment and Global Marine's significant experience in deepwater, both
       niches at the top end of the market.

     - The structure of the transaction is a merger of equals. Global Marine
       stockholders will own slightly over 50% of GlobalSantaFe, and the board
       of directors of GlobalSantaFe will consist of 14 directors, seven of whom
       will be designated by Global Marine. The executive officers of
       GlobalSantaFe will include Robert E. Rose, as chairman of the board, Jon
       A. Marshall, as executive vice president and chief operating officer,
       James L. McCulloch, as senior vice president, general counsel and
       secretary, and W. Matt Ralls, as senior vice president and chief
       financial officer.

     - Global Marine expects that the merger will be accretive to earnings per
       share for Global Marine stockholders in 2002 based on the consensus
       estimates by equity research analysts for 2002 earnings for both
       companies at the time of the merger announcement, and expense reductions
       resulting from the transaction.

     - The trading volume anticipated to be generated by the size of
       GlobalSantaFe's equity market capitalization will provide increased
       liquidity and may enable GlobalSantaFe to achieve higher valuation in the
       stock market than is achievable by Global Marine alone.

     - Estimated cost savings of approximately $25 million per year that are
       expected to be achievable by GlobalSantaFe through elimination of
       redundant shore based facilities and duplicative overhead, and increased
       purchasing power.

     - The Global Marine board reviewed the tax considerations of the merger.
       While the combination will be taxable to Global Marine stockholders, the
       Global Marine board believes that the merger can be structured in a
       manner that will enable the combined company to enjoy an effective tax
       rate that is lower than that historically achieved by Global Marine.

     - The Global Marine board considered the accounting treatment of the merger
       as a purchase of Santa Fe International by Global Marine and the related
       balance sheet and income statement impacts of this treatment.

     - The exchange ratio of 0.665 GlobalSantaFe shares for each share of Global
       Marine common stock, based on the last reported sales prices of Global
       Marine and Santa Fe International stock as reported on the NYSE Composite
       Tape on August 31, 2001, the last trading day prior to approval of the
       merger agreement, represented a premium of approximately 17% over the
       last reported sale price of Global Marine common stock on that date and a
       premium of approximately 2% over the average trading price of Global
       Marine stock over the 90 trading days prior to approval of the merger
       agreement.

     - The presentation and oral opinion of Morgan Stanley on August 31, 2001,
       which opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that
       the merger ratio under the merger agreement was fair from a financial
       point of view to the holders of Global Marine common stock on the date of
       the opinion.

     - The terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the fixed
       exchange ratio of GlobalSantaFe stock for Global Marine stock, the rights
       of the parties to respond to, evaluate and negotiate competing business
       combination proposals, the circumstances under which the merger agreement
       may be terminated and the size and impact of the termination fees
       associated with any termination, and the terms of the shareholder
       agreement with SFIC Holdings.

     - The possible opportunities and alternatives that could be available to
       Global Marine if the proposed combination with Santa Fe International
       were not undertaken, including pursuing other growth opportunities and
       strategies, and the risks, uncertainties and expenses of those
       alternatives.

     In determining that the merger is in the best interest of Global Marine and
its stockholders, Global Marine's board of directors considered the factors
above as a whole and did not assign relative weights to these factors.
Individual directors may have weighed each of these factors differently.
Moreover, the foregoing discussion of Global Marine's reasons for the merger is
not intended to be exhaustive. In considering the recommendation of Global
Marine's board of directors, you should be aware that some of the directors and
executive officers of Global Marine have interests in the merger that are
different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Global Marine
stockholders. The Global Marine board of directors was aware of these interests
and considered them in unanimously approving the merger agreement and the
merger. See "Interests of Certain Global Marine Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger" on page 54.

RECOMMENDATION OF GLOBAL MARINE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     GLOBAL MARINE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE
MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER ARE ADVISABLE AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF GLOBAL
MARINE'S STOCKHOLDERS, AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

OPINION OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Credit Suisse First Boston has acted as Santa Fe International's financial
advisor in connection with the merger. Santa Fe International selected Credit
Suisse First Boston based on Credit Suisse First Boston's experience, expertise
and reputation and its familiarity with Santa Fe International, Global Marine
and their businesses. Credit Suisse First Boston is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of
businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged
buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
corporate and other purposes.

     In connection with Credit Suisse First Boston's engagement, Santa Fe
International requested that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to Santa Fe International of the merger ratio
provided for in the merger. On August 31, 2001, at a meeting of the Santa Fe
International board of directors held to evaluate the merger, Credit Suisse
First Boston rendered to the Santa Fe International board of directors an oral
opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated
August 31, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to
the matters described in its opinion, the merger ratio was fair, from a
financial point of view, to Santa Fe International.

     THE FULL TEXT OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S WRITTEN OPINION, DATED AUGUST
31, 2001, TO THE SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH SETS FORTH THE
ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE
REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON IN RENDERING ITS OPINION, IS
ATTACHED AS ANNEX B TO THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED
INTO THIS DOCUMENT BY REFERENCE. HOLDERS OF SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL ORDINARY
SHARES ARE ENCOURAGED TO READ THIS OPINION CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY. CREDIT
SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S OPINION IS ADDRESSED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SANTA FE
INTERNATIONAL AND ADDRESSES ONLY THE FAIRNESS, FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW,
TO SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL OF THE MERGER RATIO PROVIDED FOR IN THE MERGER, DOES
NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER OR ANY RELATED TRANSACTION
AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY SHAREHOLDER AS TO ANY MATTER
RELATING TO THE MERGER. THE SUMMARY OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S OPINION IN
THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE
TO THE FULL TEXT OF THE OPINION.

     In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the merger
agreement and related documents and publicly available business and financial
information relating to Santa Fe International and Global Marine. Credit Suisse
First Boston also reviewed other information relating to Santa Fe International
and Global Marine, including financial forecasts, provided to or discussed with
Credit Suisse First Boston by Santa Fe International and Global Marine, and met
with Santa Fe International's and Global Marine's managements to discuss the
businesses and prospects of Santa Fe International and Global Marine. Credit
Suisse First Boston also considered financial and stock market data of Santa Fe
International and Global Marine, and compared those data with similar data for
other publicly held companies in businesses similar to Santa Fe International
and Global Marine and considered, to the extent publicly available, the
financial terms of other business combinations and other transactions which have
been effected or announced. Credit Suisse First Boston also considered other
information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial,
economic and market criteria that it deemed relevant.

     In connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume
any responsibility for independent verification of any of the information that
it reviewed or considered and relied on that information being complete and
accurate in all material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts
relating to Santa Fe International and Global Marine, including adjustments to
the forecasts of Global Marine prepared by the management of Santa Fe
International, Credit Suisse First Boston was advised, and assumed, that the
forecasts were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of Santa Fe International's and Global
Marine's managements as to the future financial performance of Santa Fe
International and Global Marine and as to the potential cost savings and other
synergies anticipated to result from the merger, including the amount, timing
and achievability of those synergies. Credit Suisse First Boston also assumed,
with Santa Fe International's consent, that in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory and third party approvals and consents for the proposed
merger, no modification, delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be
imposed that would have a material adverse effect on Santa Fe International or
Global

Marine or the contemplated benefits of the proposed merger. Credit Suisse First
Boston also was advised, and assumed, that the merger will be consummated in all
material respects in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without
waiver, amendment or modification of any material term, condition or agreement.
Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to make, and did not make, an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities, contingent or
otherwise, of Santa Fe International or Global Marine, and Credit Suisse First
Boston was not furnished with any evaluations or appraisals.

     Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion was necessarily based on information
available to it, and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they
existed and could be evaluated, on the date of Credit Suisse First Boston's
opinion. Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to the actual
value of Santa Fe International ordinary shares when issued in the merger or the
prices at which Santa Fe International ordinary shares will trade at any time.
Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion did not address the relative merits of the
merger as compared to other business strategies that might have been available
to Santa Fe International, and also did not address the underlying business
decision of Santa Fe International to proceed with the merger. Except as
described above, Santa Fe International imposed no other limitations on Credit
Suisse First Boston with respect to the investigations made or procedures
followed in rendering its opinion.

     In preparing its opinion to the Santa Fe International board of directors,
Credit Suisse First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative
analyses, including those described below. The summary of Credit Suisse First
Boston's analyses described below is not a complete description of the analyses
underlying Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of
those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion
is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In
arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston made qualitative judgments
as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor that it
considered. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and
factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without
considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion.

     In its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston considered industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Santa Fe International
and Global Marine. No company, business or transaction used in Credit Suisse
First Boston's analyses as a comparison is identical to Santa Fe International,
Global Marine or the proposed merger, and an evaluation of the results of those
analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics
and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other
values of the companies, business segments or transactions analyzed. The
estimates contained in Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses and the ranges of
valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In
addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston's
analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

     Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion and financial analyses were only one
of many factors considered by the Santa Fe International board of directors in
its evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative
of the views of the Santa Fe International board of directors or management with
respect to the merger or the merger ratio.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying
Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion dated August 31, 2001 delivered to the
Santa Fe International board of directors in connection with the merger. THE
FINANCIAL ANALYSES SUMMARIZED BELOW INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR
FORMAT. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND FULLY CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S FINANCIAL
ANALYSES, THE TABLES MUST BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY. THE
TABLES ALONE DO NOT CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL

ANALYSES. CONSIDERING THE DATA IN THE TABLES BELOW WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE FULL
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCIAL ANALYSES, INCLUDING THE METHODOLOGIES AND
ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE ANALYSES, COULD CREATE A MISLEADING OR INCOMPLETE
VIEW OF CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON'S FINANCIAL ANALYSES.

     EXCHANGE RATIO REFERENCE RANGE ANALYSES.  Credit Suisse First Boston
derived implied exchange ratio reference ranges based on a discounted cash flow
analysis, selected companies analysis and selected transactions analysis for
Santa Fe International and Global Marine and a relative contribution analysis
and historical stock trading analysis as more fully described below. Credit
Suisse First Boston then compared the merger ratio in the merger with the
exchange ratio reference ranges implied by these analyses.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analyses.  Credit Suisse First Boston estimated the
present value of the stand-alone, unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that each
of Santa Fe International and Global Marine could produce over calendar years
2002 through 2006, based on internal estimates of Santa Fe International's
management. Credit Suisse First Boston calculated ranges of estimated terminal
values by multiplying calendar year 2006 estimated earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA, of Santa
Fe International and Global Marine by selected multiples ranging from 6.0x to
8.0x, in the case of Santa Fe International, and 5.5x to 7.5x, in the case of
Global Marine. The estimated after-tax free cash flows and terminal values of
Santa Fe International and Global Marine were then discounted to present value
using discount rates of 12.0% to 13.0%. This analysis indicated the following
implied exchange ratio reference range, as compared to the merger ratio provided
for in the merger:

  IMPLIED EXCHANGE
RATIO REFERENCE RANGE  MERGER RATIO
---------------------  ------------

   0.45x to 0.72x         0.665x

     Selected Companies Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston compared
financial, operating and stock market data of Santa Fe International and Global
Marine to corresponding data of the following publicly traded companies in the
drilling industry:

     - Atwood Oceanics, Inc.
     - Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.
     - ENSCO International Incorporated
     - Marine Drilling Companies, Inc.
     - Noble Drilling Corporation
     - Pride International, Inc.
     - Rowan Companies, Inc.
     - Smedvig ASA
     - Transocean Sedco Forex Inc.

     Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed enterprise values, calculated as equity
value, plus total debt, preferred stock and minority interests, less cash, as
multiples of estimated asset replacement costs and calendar years 2001 and 2002
estimated EBITDA, and reviewed market values as multiples of calendar years 2001
and 2002 estimated after-tax cash flows, calculated as net income, plus
depreciation and deferred taxes, and net income. Credit Suisse First Boston then
applied a range of selected multiples derived from the selected companies of
estimated asset replacement costs and calendar years 2001 and 2002 estimated
EBITDA, after-tax cash flow and net income to corresponding financial data of
Santa Fe International and Global Marine. All multiples were based on closing
stock prices on August 29, 2001. Estimated financial data for the selected
companies were based on research analysts' estimates, estimated financial data
for Santa Fe International were based both on internal estimates of the
management of Santa Fe International and research analysts' estimates and
estimated financial data for Global Marine were based both on internal estimates
of the management of Global Marine as adjusted by the management of Santa Fe
International and research analysts' estimates. This analysis indicated the
following implied exchange ratio reference range, as compared to the merger
ratio provided for in the merger:

  IMPLIED EXCHANGE

     Credit Suisse First Boston compared transaction values in the selected
transactions as multiples of latest 12 months revenue, EBITDA and earnings
before interest and taxes, commonly referred to as EBIT. Credit Suisse First
Boston then applied a range of selected multiples derived from the selected
transactions of latest 12 months revenue, EBITDA and EBIT to corresponding
financial data of Santa Fe International and Global Marine. All multiples for
the selected transactions were based on publicly available financial
information. This analysis indicated the following implied exchange ratio
reference range, as compared to the merger ratio provided for in the merger:

     Relative Contribution Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston compared the
current market value and estimated asset replacement costs of Santa Fe
International and Global Marine and the relative contributions of Santa Fe
International and Global Marine to GlobalSantaFe's calendar year 2001 and 2002
estimated EBITDA, net income and after-tax cash flow. Estimated financial data
for Santa Fe International were based on internal estimates of the management of
Santa Fe International and estimated financial data for Global Marine were based
on internal estimates of the management of Global Marine as adjusted by the
management of Santa Fe International. This analysis yielded the following
implied exchange ratio reference range, as compared to the merger ratio provided
for in the merger:

     Historical Stock Trading Analysis.  Credit Suisse First Boston compared the
closing prices of Santa Fe International ordinary shares and Global Marine
common stock on August 29, 2001, the average daily closing prices of Santa Fe
International ordinary shares and Global Marine common stock for the one week,
one month, three months, one year, two years and three years preceding August
29, 2001 and the average daily closing prices of Santa Fe International ordinary
shares and Global Marine common stock for the period between August 29, 2001 and
June 10, 1997, which is the date of the initial public offering of Santa Fe
International ordinary shares. This comparison yielded the following implied
exchange ratio reference range, as compared to the merger ratio provided for in
the merger:

     PRO FORMA MERGER ANALYSIS.  Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the
potential pro forma effect of the merger on Santa Fe International's estimated
earnings per share and after-tax cash flow per share for calendar year 2002,
after giving effect to potential cost savings, synergies and other financial
effects anticipated by Santa Fe International's management to result from the
merger. Estimated financial data for Santa Fe International were based on
internal estimates of the management of Santa Fe International and estimated
financial data for Global Marine were based on internal estimates of the
management of Global Marine as adjusted by the management of Santa Fe
International. Based on the merger ratio provided for in the merger, this
analysis indicated that the proposed merger would be dilutive to Santa Fe
International's estimated earnings per share, and accretive to Santa Fe
International's estimated after-tax cash flow per share, in calendar year 2002.
Estimates based on publicly available financial data, as well as the actual
results achieved by GlobalSantaFe, may vary from these projected results and the
variations may be material.

     OTHER FACTORS.  In the course of preparing its opinion, Credit Suisse First
Boston also reviewed and considered other information and data, including:

     - the daily closing prices of Santa Fe International ordinary shares and
       Global Marine common stock for the period between June 10, 1997, the date
       of the initial public offering of Santa Fe International ordinary shares,
       and August 29, 2001.

     - the relationship between the enterprise values and market values of Santa
       Fe International and Global Marine and the implied multiples of various
       operational metrics of Santa Fe International and Global Marine, and the
       implied multiples of various operational metrics of Global Marine based
       on the merger ratio provided for in the merger.

     - the premiums/(discounts) implied by the merger ratio provided for in the
       merger relative to the historical trading relationship of Santa Fe
       International ordinary shares and Global Marine common stock over various
       periods between June 10, 1997 and August 29, 2001.

     MISCELLANEOUS.  Santa Fe International has agreed to pay Credit Suisse
First Boston a customary fee for its financial advisory services upon
consummation of the merger. Santa Fe International also has agreed to reimburse
Credit Suisse First Boston for its out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and
expenses of legal counsel and any other advisor retained by Credit Suisse First
Boston, and to indemnify Credit Suisse First Boston and related parties against
liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising
out of its engagement.

     Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates in the past have provided,
and may in the future provide, investment banking and financial services to
Santa Fe International and its affiliates and Global Marine unrelated to the
proposed merger, for which services Credit Suisse First Boston and its
affiliates have received, and would receive, compensation. In the ordinary
course of business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates may actively
trade the debt and equity securities of both Santa Fe International and Global
Marine for their own accounts and for the accounts of customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in those securities.

OPINION OF GLOBAL MARINE'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR

     Global Marine retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory
services and a financial fairness opinion in connection with the merger. Morgan
Stanley was selected to act as Global Marine's financial advisor based on Morgan
Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the
business and affairs of Global Marine. At the meeting of the Global Marine board
of directors on August 31, 2001, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion to the
board that as of that date, and subject to and based on the various
considerations set forth in the opinion, the merger ratio pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Global
Marine common stock. Morgan Stanley subsequently confirmed its oral opinion by
delivery of its written opinion dated August 31, 2001.

     THE FULL TEXT OF MORGAN STANLEY'S WRITTEN OPINION, DATED AS OF AUGUST 31,
2001, WHICH SETS FORTH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES
FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN BY MORGAN
STANLEY IN RENDERING ITS OPINION, IS ATTACHED AS ANNEX C TO THIS JOINT PROXY

STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS DOCUMENT BY REFERENCE.
HOLDERS OF GLOBAL MARINE COMMON STOCK ARE ENCOURAGED TO, AND SHOULD, READ THIS
OPINION CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY. MORGAN STANLEY'S OPINION IS DIRECTED TO THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GLOBAL MARINE, ADDRESSES ONLY THE FAIRNESS, FROM A
FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW, TO THE HOLDERS OF GLOBAL MARINE COMMON STOCK OF THE
MERGER RATIO PROVIDED FOR IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER
ASPECT OF THE PROPOSED MERGER OR ANY RELATED TRANSACTION AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
A RECOMMENDATION TO ANY GLOBAL MARINE STOCKHOLDER AS TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO
THE MERGER. THE SUMMARY OF MORGAN STANLEY'S OPINION IN THIS JOINT PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL TEXT
OF THE OPINION.

     In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other
things:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other
       information of Global Marine and Santa Fe International;

     - reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and
       operating data concerning Global Marine and Santa Fe International
       prepared by the managements of Global Marine and Santa Fe International,
       respectively;

     - reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the managements of
       Global Marine and Santa Fe International, respectively;

     - discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the
       prospects of Global Marine and Santa Fe International, including
       information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational
       benefits anticipated from the merger, with senior executives of Global
       Marine and Santa Fe International;

     - reviewed the pro forma impact of the merger on Santa Fe International's
       earnings per share and cash flow per share;

     - reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Global Marine
       common stock and the Santa Fe International ordinary shares;

     - compared the financial performance of Global Marine and Santa Fe
       International and the prices and trading activity of the Global Marine
       common stock and the Santa Fe International ordinary shares with that of
       certain other comparable publicly-traded companies and their securities;

     - reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       certain comparable merger transactions;

     - participated in discussions and negotiations among representatives of
       Global Marine and Santa Fe International and their financial and legal
       advisors;

     - reviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents; and

     - performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as Morgan
       Stanley deemed appropriate.

     In rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information
reviewed for the purposes of this opinion. With respect to the financial
projections, including information relating to certain strategic, financial and
operational benefits anticipated from the merger, Morgan Stanley assumed that
such projections had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the future financial performance
of Global Marine and Santa Fe International. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed
that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in
the merger agreement. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities of Global Marine and Santa Fe
International, nor was it furnished with any such appraisals. Morgan Stanley's
opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Morgan Stanley
as of, the date of its opinion.

     The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with its oral opinion and the
preparation of its written opinion dated August 31, 2001. This summary of Morgan
Stanley's financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format.
In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley,
the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses.

     Historical Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Morgan Stanley reviewed the ratio of
the daily closing prices of Global Marine common stock divided by the
corresponding closing price of Santa Fe International ordinary shares over
various periods ended August 30, 2001. Morgan Stanley calculated the premium
represented by the merger ratio of 0.665 over the average of the historical
ratios for various periods. The following table presents the range of historical
ratios over the periods covered compared to the merger ratio.

     Comparable Publicly Traded Company Analysis.  As part of its analysis,
Morgan Stanley compared certain publicly available financial information of
Global Marine and Santa Fe International with that of a selected group of
publicly traded offshore drilling companies which share some characteristics
with Global Marine or Santa Fe International as set forth in the table below.
This financial information included price to forecasted 2001 and 2002 earnings
per share ("EPS") multiples, price to forecasted 2001 and 2002 cash flow per
share ("CFPS") multiples, firm value to forecasted 2001 and 2002 EBITDA
multiples, equity value to net asset value ("NAV," defined as the estimated
current market value of the assets less debt and preferred stock plus cash
divided by the shares outstanding) and equity value to replacement value of
assets ("RVA," defined as the estimated replacement value of the assets less
debt and preferred stock plus cash divided by the shares outstanding). This
analysis was based on a compilation of estimates by securities research analysts
and other publicly available financial information. The following table
presents, as of August 30, 2001, the range of multiples for the comparable
companies of each of price to projected 2001 and 2002 EPS, price to projected

2001 and 2002 CFPS, firm value to projected 2001 and 2002 EBITDA, equity value
to NAV and equity value to RVA:

     No company utilized in Morgan Stanley's peer group comparison analysis as a
comparable company is identical to Global Marine or Santa Fe International.
Accordingly, an analysis of the above results necessarily involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the companies and other factors that could affect the public
trading value of companies to which they are being compared. In evaluating the
comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard
to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Global
Marine or Santa Fe International, as well as the assumed absence of any material
adverse change in the financial condition and prospects of Global Marine, Santa
Fe International or the industry or in the financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not, in
itself, a meaningful method of using comparable publicly traded company data.

     Pro Forma Impact of Case Assumptions.  In order to determine the pro forma
impact of the merger on an EPS and CFPS basis, Morgan Stanley performed an
analysis that included the use of several different scenarios, or case
assumptions. The "Street Case" set of projections reflects the mean of estimates
of securities research analysts for 2001 and 2002, for EPS and CFPS, and Morgan
Stanley's research analyst projections for Peak EPS and CFPS for Global Marine
and Santa Fe International, which are estimates of the best possible results for
each company given the then current economic conditions. The "Global Management
Case" and the "Global Management Downside Case" reflect Global Marine
management's base case and downside case projections, respectively, for Global
Marine and Santa Fe International. The "Santa Fe International Management Case"
set of projections reflects Santa Fe International management's projections for
Global Marine and Santa Fe International. These estimates included the benefit
of a restructuring of the ownership of a portion of the assets of Global Marine
and its subsidiaries, of approximately $0.13 per share, which was assumed to
occur whether or not Global Marine merged with Santa Fe International. This
restructuring was expected to lower Global Marine's effective tax rate, thus
increasing Global Marine's relative contribution to the combined company.

     Contribution Analysis.  Morgan Stanley reviewed certain projected operating
and financial information, including, among other things, earnings, cash flow
(defined as net income plus depletion, depreciation and amortization) and
EBITDA, for Global Marine, Santa Fe International and the pro forma combined
entity resulting from the merger, excluding non-recurring integration related
costs or charges. Morgan Stanley also analyzed and reviewed certain estimates of
NAVs and RVAs, as well as equity research analyst price targets. The analysis
was performed utilizing information for Global Marine and Santa Fe International
based on estimates from the management of Global Marine and Santa Fe
International for the fiscal years ended 2001

through 2003 and based on various scenarios as noted above. This analysis
yielded the following ranges of Global Marine's implied pro forma ownership
percentage in GlobalSantaFe:

RVA.........................................................          51.2-55.0
Analyst Price Targets.......................................               51.8

     Pro Forma Merger Analysis.  Morgan Stanley analyzed the pro forma impact of
the merger on Global Marine's projected EPS and CFPS for the fiscal years ended
2001, 2002 and 2003 and peak earnings results, while giving effect to $25
million of expected pre-tax synergies starting in 2002 and the impact of a
reduction in Global Marine's effective income tax rate resulting from the
merger. The analysis was performed utilizing the "Global Management Case," the
"Global Management Downside Case," the "Santa Fe International Management Case"
and the "Street Case" estimates as described earlier. Based on these forecasts
examined both with and without the implementation of the planned tax
restructuring by Global Marine, the merger would be expected to have the
following impacts going forward. The analysis showed the transaction to be
dilutive to EPS and CFPS in 2001. In 2002, the analysis showed the transaction
to be accretive to EPS for all cases except for the "Global Management Case"
with restructuring, for which the analysis showed the transaction to be dilutive
in 2002. With regard to CFPS, the analysis showed the transaction to be
accretive in 2002 in all cases except for the "Global Management Cases" with
restructuring as well as the "Street Case" with and without restructuring. For
2003, the analysis showed the transaction to be accretive to EPS and CFPS in all
cases except for the "Global Management Case" with restructuring.

     In connection with the review of the merger by the Global Marine board,
Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of its opinion given in connection therewith. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan
Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not
attribute any particular weight to any particular analysis or factor considered
by it. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its
analyses or factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and
factors as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process underlying
its opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and
factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors and may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions, so that the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above
should therefore not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of
Global Marine or Santa Fe International.

     In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Global Marine or Santa Fe
International. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analysis are not
necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. The
analyses were prepared solely as part of Morgan Stanley's analysis of the
fairness from a financial point of view of the merger ratio, pursuant to the
merger agreement, to the holders of Global Marine common stock and were
conducted in connection with the delivery by Morgan Stanley of its opinion dated
August 31, 2001 to the Global Marine board of directors. The analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which Global Marine common
stock or Santa Fe International ordinary shares actually may be valued or the
prices at which their shares may actually trade in the marketplace. Accordingly,
such analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

     In addition, as described above, Morgan Stanley's opinion and presentation
to the Global Marine board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Global Marine board of directors in making its decision to
approve the merger. Consequently, the Morgan Stanley analyses as described above
should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Global Marine board
of directors with respect to the value of

Global Marine or of whether the Global Marine board of directors would have been
willing to agree to a different merger ratio. The merger ratio pursuant to the
merger agreement and other terms of the merger agreement were determined through
arm's-length negotiations between Global Marine and Santa Fe International and
were approved by the Global Marine board of directors. Morgan Stanley did not
recommend any specific merger ratio to Global Marine or that any given merger
ratio constituted the only appropriate merger ratio for the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit,
and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to a business
combination or other extraordinary transaction, involving Global Marine, nor did
it negotiate with any of the parties, other than Santa Fe International, in
connection with such a business combination or other extraordinary transaction.

     Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized investment banking and
advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial
advisory business, is continuously engaged in the valuation of businesses and
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwriting,
competitive biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the
ordinary course of business, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates may from time to
time trade in the securities or indebtedness of Global Marine and/or Santa Fe
International for its own account, the accounts of investment funds and other
clients under the management of Morgan Stanley or its affiliates and for the
accounts of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or
short position in such securities or indebtedness.

     Pursuant to an engagement letter, dated August 29, 2001, between Morgan
Stanley and Global Marine, Morgan Stanley provided financial advisory services
and a financial opinion in connection with the merger, and Global Marine agreed
to pay Morgan Stanley a customary fee at the time of the closing of the merger.
Global Marine has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its expenses
incurred in performing its services. In addition, Global Marine has agreed to
indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan
Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses,
including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or
arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement and any related transactions. In the
past, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have provided financial advisory
services to Santa Fe International and have received fees for the rendering of
these services.

MANAGEMENT OF GLOBALSANTAFE

     At the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of
GlobalSantaFe will consist of the following 14 directors:

     - Robert E. Rose, Thomas W. Cason, C. Russell Luigs, Edward R. Muller, Paul
       J. Powers, Carroll W. Suggs and John L. Whitmire, each of whom is a
       current director of Global Marine;

     - C. Stedman Garber, Jr., Ferdinand A. Berger, Richard L. George and
       Stephen J. Solarz, each of whom is a current director of Santa Fe
       International; and

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN
THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Santa Fe
International to vote for the merger-related proposals, shareholders of Santa Fe
International should be aware that members of the Santa Fe International board
of directors and certain executive officers have agreements and/or arrangements
that provide them with interests in the merger that differ from those of Santa
Fe International shareholders, including those described under "-- Management of
GlobalSantaFe." The Santa Fe International board of directors was aware of these
agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of the merits of the merger
and in determining to recommend to the shareholders of Santa Fe International
that they vote for the merger-related proposals.

     Payments to Directors.  Every non-employee director who resigns from the
board of directors of Santa Fe International as contemplated by the merger
agreement will be entitled to a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to
$100,000 for his or her service as a director through the date of the merger.

     Gordon M. Anderson will receive $100,000 at the effective time of the
merger in recognition for relinquishing his responsibilities as non-executive
chairman as contemplated by the merger agreement, which is in addition to the
payment he will receive upon resigning from the board of directors for his
service as a director through the date of the merger.

     Santa Fe International Stock Options and Restricted Shares.  In connection
with the merger, all options granted to non-employee directors pursuant to the
1997 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan and the 2001 Long Term Incentive
Plan will become fully exercisable as of the effective time of the merger. In
addition, such options will remain exercisable following the termination of a
non-employee director's service for any reason until the earlier of (i) the
fifth anniversary of the date of termination of service and (ii) the expiration
date of the options.

     All options and restricted shares granted to executive officers, other
officers and employees pursuant to the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan and 2001
Long Term Incentive Plan will become fully exercisable and unrestricted as of
the effective time of the merger.

     As of October 15, 2001, Messrs. Garber, Hunt, McCarty, Moomjian and
Seeliger held options to acquire 396,388, 120,175, 112,050, 82,450 and 112,050
ordinary shares of Santa Fe International, respectively, that are not yet
exercisable. All other officers as a group held options to acquire 569,475
ordinary shares of Santa Fe International that are not yet exercisable.

     As of October 15, 2001, the number of stock options not yet exercisable
held by directors and executive officers of Santa Fe International totalled
869,112. Assuming the merger is completed on November 20, 2001, the number of
stock options held by directors and executive officers that would become
exercisable on November 20, 2001 would total 869,112 with an average weighted
exercise price of $24.60.

     In connection with the merger, the board of directors of Santa Fe
International authorized a grant, as of the effective time of the merger, of up
to 1,000,000 options to purchase shares of GlobalSantaFe to officers or
employees. These options have been allocated in the following manner: 300,000
options to Mr. Garber, 90,000 options to Mr. McCarty, 90,000 options to Mr.
Moomjian, 45,000 options to Mr. Hunt, 45,000 options to Mr. Seeliger and 430,000
options to all other officers and employees as a group. Such options will have
an exercise price equal to the fair market value of GlobalSantaFe's ordinary
shares on the date of the effective time of the merger. The options will become
exercisable 50% on the second anniversary of the effective time of the merger
and 25% on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the effective time of
the merger, subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain specified
events.

     Employment and Severance Agreements.  In connection with the merger, as
chief executive officer and president, Mr. Garber entered into a letter
agreement with Santa Fe International setting forth his duties and
responsibilities following the merger and amending the terms of his Executive
Severance Protection Agreement.

     The agreement provides that Mr. Garber will have complete authority and
responsibility over the business and affairs of GlobalSantaFe as president and
chief executive officer, and he will serve on the board of directors. The
agreement also provides for a specific allocation of duties and responsibilities
between Mr. Garber, as president and chief executive officer, and Mr. Rose, as
chairman of the board of directors, for so long as Mr. Rose serves as chairman.
In particular, Mr. Garber's duties as president and chief executive officer
include consulting with the chairman of the board of directors to develop
management's recommendations to the board of directors with respect to
GlobalSantaFe's positions on strategic issues.

     The agreement also provides that Mr. Garber's Executive Severance
Protection Agreement is modified to provide that "good reason" includes: (i)
without his consent, assignment of duties inconsistent with his position as
described above, (ii) without his consent, any action by GlobalSantaFe which
results in a material diminution of his position, duties or status, (iii)
without his consent, his removal from the board of directors, his failure to be
nominated to the board of directors or his failure to be elected to the board of
directors, (iv) reduction of his base salary and (v) the failure of
GlobalSantaFe to provide him with incentive compensation opportunities
consistent with those provided immediately prior to the merger. He will receive
benefits under his Executive Severance Protection Agreement in the event of his
termination of employment other than for "cause" or in the event of his
voluntary termination for "good reason" during the period beginning on a "change
in control" (including the merger) and ending on the later of (i) three years
after a "change in control" and (ii) the date following his 62nd birthday. Prior
to such amendment, the period of termination protection was limited to two years
following a change in control.

     In the event that Mr. Garber becomes entitled to a severance benefit
pursuant to his Executive Severance Protection Agreement, the agreement provides
that Mr. Garber's pension benefits will be based on an additional three years of
service and three years of age (in any case, as if he had attained age 62 while
employed by GlobalSantaFe).

     Mr. Garber's outstanding options will become exercisable and restrictions
on his restricted shares will lapse at the effective time of the merger.
Additionally, if he becomes eligible to receive severance benefits, his options
will remain exercisable for a period ending on the earlier of (i) three years
following his termination of employment or (ii) the expiration of the original
terms of the options.

     The Executive Severance Protection Agreements entered into by Santa Fe
International with Messrs. Garber, Hunt, McCarty, Moomjian and Seeliger
outstanding as of the effective time of the merger will be amended to provide
that in the event of the executive's termination of employment without "cause"
or voluntary termination for "good reason" during the three-year period
following a "change in control" (including the merger), the executive will be
entitled to severance benefits under the agreement. Prior to such amendment, the
period of termination protection was limited to a period of two years following
a change in control.

     In addition, in the event that an executive becomes entitled to severance
benefits under the Employee Severance Protection Plan, such executive's options
will remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) three years following the
termination of such executive's employment and (ii) the expiration of the
option.

     Pursuant to the Executive Severance Protection Agreements with those
executives noted above, in the event of termination of the executive's
employment within three years following the effective time of the merger by
GlobalSantaFe without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason," the
executive will be entitled to the following severance benefits:

     - a cash payment equal to three times base salary and three times the
       annual target bonus under the Annual Incentive Plan for the fiscal year
       in which the change in control occurs;

     - basic life insurance, disability plan benefits, and medical and dental
       benefits for the executive and his dependents and beneficiaries for three
       years following termination of employment or until the executive becomes
       covered under a subsequent employer's benefit plans;

     - an additional three years of service and three years of age credit under
       each applicable non-qualified pension plan; and

     - outplacement and/or financial planning services in an amount not to
       exceed $30,000.

     Mr. Garber is entitled to substantially similar severance benefits, except
for the differences described above pursuant to the letter agreement entered
into between Mr. Garber and Santa Fe International.

     In the event that any distribution to or for the benefit of any of the
executives is determined to be a "parachute payment" and subject to an excise
tax, the executive will be entitled to receive a gross-up payment such that,
after payment of all taxes and the excise tax, the executive retains an amount
equal to the excise tax.

     Assuming that each of the executive officers were to incur a termination of
employment entitling them to severance benefits pursuant to the Executive
Severance Protection Agreements, Messrs. Garber, Hunt, McCarty, Moomjian and
Seeliger would receive aggregate cash payments (excluding any additional amounts
that would be payable if an excise tax were imposed) of $3,018,750, $1,152,750,
$1,152,750, $945,000 and $1,152,750, respectively. All other officers as a group
would receive aggregate cash payments (excluding any additional amounts that
would be payable if an excise tax were imposed) totaling $7,397,049.

     Annual Incentive Plan Supplemental Pension Benefit.  With respect to an
employee who is entitled to a bonus under the Annual Incentive Plan, in the
event that such employee becomes eligible for severance benefits under the
Employee Severance Protection Plan, such employee will receive a supplemental
pension benefit equal to the difference between (i) the amount calculated by
including one-twelfth of such employee's Annual Incentive Plan bonus for the
relevant year in the monthly base rate for purposes of calculating such
employee's pension benefits over (ii) the pension benefits actually payable to
such employee.

     Management's Stock Ownership.  Santa Fe International directors and
executive officers beneficially owned, as of the record date for the Santa Fe
International extraordinary general meeting, approximately 494,135 ordinary
shares of Santa Fe International, including exercisable Santa Fe International
options on ordinary shares, representing less than 1% of the outstanding Santa
Fe International ordinary shares, including exercisable Santa Fe International
options.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN GLOBAL MARINE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE
MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Global
Marine to vote for the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement,
stockholders of Global Marine should be aware that members of the Global Marine
board of directors and members of Global Marine's management team have
agreements and arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that
differ from those of Global Marine stockholders, including those described under
"-- Management of GlobalSantaFe." The Global Marine board of directors was aware
of these agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of the merits of
the

merger and in determining to recommend to the stockholders of Global Marine that
they vote for the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement.

     Payments to Directors.  A lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to
$104,000 will be made to directors of Global Marine who continue service through
the effective time of the merger and are not designated to serve on the board of
directors of GlobalSantaFe upon the closing of the merger. The payments are the
equivalent of two years' retainer plus the cash value of two years of restricted
stock grants.

     Global Marine Stock Options and Performance Stock Awards.  Generally, all
options to purchase shares of Global Marine common stock under the Global Marine
1989 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the Global Marine 1998 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan, the Global Marine 1994 Non-Employee Stock Option and Incentive
Plan, and the Global Marine 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option and
Incentive Plan will become fully exercisable as of the effective time of the
merger. All options to purchase shares of Global Marine common stock under the
Global Marine 1990 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan became fully
exercisable on August 31, 2001, upon approval of the merger by the Global Marine
board of directors. All stock options held by directors and employees under the
Global Marine option plans will become options to purchase ordinary shares of
GlobalSantaFe, subject to adjustment based on the merger ratio. As of October
15, 2001, the number of unexercisable stock options held by directors and
executive officers of Global Marine totaled 2,440,675. Assuming the merger is
completed on November 20, 2001, the number of stock options held by directors
and executive officers that would become exercisable on November 20, 2001 and
that became exercisable on the August 31, 2001 approval of the merger would
total 2,456,175 with prices ranging from $7.6875 to $33.0650. In addition, all
conditions, contingencies and other restrictions on performance stock awards
will lapse upon approval of the merger by stockholders of Global Marine, thereby
resulting in the vesting of performance stock relating to 646,388 shares of
Global Marine common stock.

     Under the terms of the merger agreement, options outstanding under the 1990
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan will be deemed to be modified such that
they will remain exercisable for their full scheduled term in the event that the
option holder does not become a non-employee director of GlobalSantaFe or in the
event that the non-employee director terminates service prior to the expiration
of the option under conditions which would permit the option to remain
outstanding and exercisable for its full scheduled term under the terms of the
options issued to the non-employee director pursuant to the Global Marine 2001
Non-Employee Director Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The options will remain
exercisable for three months following termination of service under any other
conditions.

     In addition, all restrictions on restricted stock granted to non-employee
directors under the Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan will lapse upon
approval of the merger by stockholders of Global Marine. As of October 15, 2001,
non-employee directors of Global Marine as a group held 10,632 shares of Global
Marine restricted stock.

     As of October 15, 2001, Messrs. Rose, Marshall, Ralls, Vrooman and Woolie
held options to acquire 831,250, 360,000, 214,250, 178,750 and 215,750 shares of
Global Marine common stock, respectively, that were not yet exercisable. In
addition, all other executive officers as a group held options to acquire
539,175 shares of Global Marine common stock that were not yet exercisable.

     As of October 15, 2001, Messrs. Rose, Marshall, Ralls, Vrooman and Woolie
held performance shares, subject to conditions and restrictions, relating to
225,000, 120,000, 75,000, 60,000 and 75,000 shares of Global Marine common
stock, respectively. In addition, all other executive officers as a group held
performance shares that were subject to conditions and restrictions relating to
90,000 shares of Global Marine common stock.

     Indemnification and Insurance.  All past and present officers and directors
of Global Marine will be indemnified by Global Marine, to the extent permitted
under applicable law, from and after the effective time of the merger against
all claims arising out of all acts and omissions in their capacities as officers
and directors. In the event of a claim, GlobalSantaFe will cause Global Marine
to pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel, and GlobalSantaFe and
Global Marine will cooperate in the defense of any such claim.

     For a period of six years following the effective time of the merger,
GlobalSantaFe will cause Global Marine to maintain officers' and directors'
liability insurance covering the officers and directors who are currently
covered by Global Marine's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance
policies, provided that GlobalSantaFe and Global Marine will not be required to
pay annual premiums in excess of 150% of the last annual premium paid by Global
Marine.

     Employment and Severance Agreements.  All of the executive officers of
Global Marine, other than Mr. Rose, who is covered by a separate arrangement
discussed below, will be entitled to severance benefits in the event of
termination of employment without "cause" or in the event of resignation of
employment for "good reason" during the 36-month period following either
approval of the merger by stockholders of Global Marine or the effective time of
the merger. In the event of such termination of employment, such executive
officers are entitled to the following severance payments:

     - unpaid base salary through the date of termination;

     - lump sum cash payment of any deferred compensation;

     - an amount equal to three times the executive's annual base salary payable
       in equal monthly installments over three years following the date of
       termination;

     - an amount equal to three times the highest bonus paid or payable in any
       one year to the executive in the three years immediately prior to the
       date of termination;

     - health insurance, dental insurance and life insurance benefits during the
       severance period, provided that such benefits will be secondary if the
       executive is eligible to receive such benefits through another employer;

     - continued accrual of years of service under any defined benefit plan the
       executive participates in for the severance period or until the executive
       or the executive's spouse begins to receive a benefit under any such
       plan;

     - immediate vesting of benefits under the Executive Supplemental Retirement
       Plan of 1990, as amended, as if the executive had attained at least age
       55 and at least five years of service; and

     - with respect to executives younger than age 55, status as if the
       executive had attained age 55 for purposes of post-retirement benefits.

     Messrs. Dawson, Krezel and Stegall participate in the Global Marine
Employee Severance Program for Shorebased Staff Personnel. In the event of a
resignation for "good reason" or an involuntary termination other than for
"cause" within the 36-month period following either approval of the merger by
stockholders of Global Marine or the effective time of the merger, these
individuals will be entitled to two years of salary continuation, a lump sum
payment equal to their target bonus and eligibility, subject to certain
conditions, for two years of continued medical, dental and life insurance
benefits.

     In the event that any distribution to or for the benefit of any of the
executives is determined to be a "parachute payment" and subject to an excise
tax, the executive will be entitled to receive a gross-up payment such that,
after payment of all taxes and the excise tax, the executive retains an amount
equal to the excise tax.

     Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Rose is also eligible to receive
severance benefits if he is terminated without "cause" or if he resigns for
"good reason" during the 36-month period following the effective time of the
merger. The severance benefits to which he would be entitled in the event of
such a termination are substantially similar to those outlined above with the
following exceptions: (i) Mr. Rose is entitled to a payment equal to the greater
of (a) his annual salary for the remaining number of full months in the term of
his employment agreement or (b) three times his annual salary, (ii) Mr. Rose is
entitled to a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the greater of (a) the
highest incentive bonus paid or payable to him in any one year in the three
years prior to the date of termination and (b) the highest target incentive
bonus established for him in the three years immediately prior to the date of
termination and (iii) for each year of actual employment, Mr. Rose is credited
with three years of service for purposes of determining eligibility and the
amount of benefits under the Global Marine Executive Supplemental Retirement
Plan of 1990 and all non-pension post-retirement benefits.

     Mr. Rose is also entitled to a gross-up payment in the event that any
distribution is determined to be a "parachute payment" and subject to an excise
tax such that, after payment of all taxes and the excise tax, he retains an
amount equal to the excise tax.

     Assuming that each of the executive officers incurs a termination of
employment entitling him to severance benefits, Messrs. Rose, Marshall, Ralls,
Vrooman and Woolie would receive aggregate cash payments (excluding any
additional amounts that would be payable if an excise tax were imposed) of
approximately $4,380,000, $1,867,500, $1,380,000, $1,320,000 and $1,380,000,
respectively. In addition, all other executive officers as a group would receive
aggregate cash payments (excluding any additional amounts that would be payable
if an excise tax were imposed) of approximately $3,510,780.

     As of the effective time of the merger, Mr. Rose's employment agreement
with Global Marine will be amended such that Mr. Rose will become employed by
GlobalSantaFe. He will assume the position of chairman of the board of directors
of GlobalSantaFe. As chairman of the board of directors of GlobalSantaFe, Mr.
Rose will provide advice and counsel in developing management's recommendations
on the company's positions on strategic issues and will lead the board of
directors in establishing its position on such issues, will establish agendas
and make arrangements for meetings of the board of directors and meetings of
stockholders, have general responsibility for information flow to the board of
directors, will assist in the integration of both companies following the
merger, in coordination with the chief executive officer, will act as senior
company liaison with industry, community and political contacts regarding issues
of concern to GlobalSantaFe and will exercise and perform such other powers and
duties as may from time to time be assigned to him by the board of directors or
prescribed by GlobalSantaFe's memorandum of association and articles of
association.

     In consideration of his execution of the amendment to his employment
agreement, Mr. Rose was granted an award of 250,000 restricted shares of Global
Marine effective upon the effective time of the merger. The obligation to issue
these shares will be assumed by GlobalSantaFe and GlobalSantaFe shares, adjusted
for the merger ratio, will be issued to Mr. Rose. None of the restrictions
relating to these restricted shares lapse as a result of the merger.

     Management's Stock Ownership.  Global Marine directors and executive
officers (19 persons) beneficially owned, as of the record date for the Global
Marine special meeting, 3,456,543 shares of Global Marine common stock,
including exercisable Global Marine common stock options, representing 1.9% of
the outstanding Global Marine common stock.

CLOSING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The closing of the merger will occur when all of the conditions to the
merger are satisfied or waived, including the approval of the merger-related
proposals by the shareholders of Santa Fe International and the approval and
adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Global Marine. The
merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance of a certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
time as Santa Fe International and Global Marine shall have agreed upon and
designated in such filing.

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine intend to complete the merger as
quickly as possible after all the conditions to the merger, including obtaining
the approvals of their respective shareholders at the extraordinary general
meeting and special meeting, are satisfied or waived. Satisfaction of some of
these conditions, including receipt of governmental clearances or approvals, is
not entirely within Santa Fe International's or Global Marine's control. Subject
to obtaining the approval of our respective shareholders at the shareholder
meetings and receipt of all required governmental clearances and approvals, we
expect to complete the merger immediately following the shareholder meetings.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

     In order to accomplish the merger, Santa Fe International formed Gold
Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Silver Sub,
which itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of Santa Fe International. Pursuant to
the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Gold Merger Sub will
merge with and into Global Marine, with Global Marine surviving the merger and
thereby becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Santa Fe International. Santa Fe
International's name will be changed to GlobalSantaFe Corporation in connection
with the merger.

EXCHANGE OF GLOBAL MARINE COMMON STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR GLOBALSANTAFE ORDINARY
SHARE CERTIFICATES

     Each share of Global Marine common stock outstanding immediately before the
effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.665
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares at the effective time of the merger. Before the
merger, Silver Sub will acquire the newly issued Santa Fe International
(GlobalSantaFe after the merger) ordinary shares that Silver Sub will deliver to
the Global Marine stockholders in the merger. To allow record holders of Global
Marine common stock to exchange their certificates for certificates of
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares, Silver Sub will deposit with an exchange agent
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares) that will
be issued in exchange for the Global Marine common stock certificates. The
exchange agent will mail to each holder of Global Marine common stock a
transmittal form that will contain instructions for the surrender of Global
Marine common stock certificates to be exchanged in the merger. Holders of
Global Marine common stock who surrender to the exchange agent their Global
Marine common stock certificates, along with the transmittal form, will receive
a certificate representing the number of whole GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares
that they are entitled to receive. These Global Marine stockholders will also
receive a check representing cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions that the stockholders may have a right to
receive.

     The surrendered Global Marine stock certificates will be canceled. If any
Global Marine common stock certificates are presented to GlobalSantaFe or the
exchange agent after the merger, those certificates will be canceled and
exchanged for certificates representing GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares (plus cash
in lieu of fractional shares, if any) that the holder of the Global Marine
common stock certificates is entitled to receive under the merger agreement.

     None of Santa Fe International (or GlobalSantaFe after the merger), Silver
Sub, Global Marine, the exchange agent or any other person will be liable to any
former Global Marine stockholder for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

CONVERSION OF STOCK OPTIONS, PERFORMANCE STOCK AND RESTRICTED SHARES AND
ASSUMPTION OF STOCK PLANS

     At the effective time of the merger, all options to acquire shares of
Global Marine common stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger under
the Global Marine 1989 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the Global Marine 1998
Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the Global Marine 1994 Non-Employee Stock
Option and Incentive Plan, the Global Marine 1990 Non-Employee Director Stock
Option Plan and the Global Marine 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option and
Incentive Plan and options granted to newly hired employees pursuant to the
merger agreement will be assumed by GlobalSantaFe. The options under the Global
Marine 1990 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan became fully exercisable by
their terms on August 31, 2001, upon the Global Marine board's approval of the
merger. All other such options will be fully exercisable as of the effective
time of the merger. Options for the purchase of shares of Global Marine common
stock assumed by GlobalSantaFe will be exercisable for ordinary shares of
GlobalSantaFe, adjusted as follows: (i) each option to purchase a share of
Global Marine common stock will be exercisable for that whole number of ordinary
shares of GlobalSantaFe equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole
share) of the number of shares of Global Marine common stock subject to such
option multiplied by 0.665 and (ii) the exercise price per ordinary share of
GlobalSantaFe will be an amount equal to the exercise price per share of Global
Marine common stock subject to such option divided by 0.665 (rounded down to the
nearest whole cent). Each option outstanding under the Global Marine 1990
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan will remain exercisable for its full
scheduled term in the event the holder of the option does not become a
non-employee director of GlobalSantaFe or terminates service as a non-employee
director of GlobalSantaFe prior to the expiration of the option under conditions
that would permit the option to remain outstanding and exercisable for its full
scheduled term under the terms of the options issued to such non-employee
director pursuant to the Global Marine 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option
and Incentive Plan and will remain exercisable for three months following
termination of service under any other conditions.

     As discussed above under "Interests of Certain Global Marine Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger," upon approval of the merger by stockholders
of Global Marine, all conditions, contingencies and other restrictions on
performance stock awards will lapse, thereby resulting in the vesting of the
shares of

performance stock. In addition, all restrictions on restricted stock granted to
non-employee directors under the Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan
will lapse upon approval of the merger by the Global Marine stockholders. None
of the restrictions relating to the 250,000 restricted shares granted to Mr.
Rose in connection with the merger will lapse as a result of the merger. All
such shares of performance stock and restricted stock will be converted to
ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe pursuant to the merger agreement.

     GlobalSantaFe will assume the Global Marine 1998 Stock Option and Incentive
Plan, the Global Marine 1994 Non-Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan and
the Global Marine 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option and Incentive Plan.
The number of shares of Global Marine common stock available for issuance under
these plans as of October 15, 2001 are 17,671,582, 389,655 and 1,030,500,
respectively, and following assumption of such plans by GlobalSantaFe, the
number of shares available will be adjusted based on the merger ratio.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

     At the effective time of the merger, all employees of Global Marine and its
subsidiaries initially will continue to be employed by Global Marine as an
indirect subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe at the same salaries and wages of such
employees immediately prior to the merger, subject to the right of the surviving
entity and its subsidiaries to subsequently alter such salaries and wages and
the terms of employment. With respect to each employee of Global Marine and its
subsidiaries, GlobalSantaFe will cause Global Marine to deem the period of
employment with Global Marine and its subsidiaries to have been employment and
service with GlobalSantaFe for purposes of determining the employee's
eligibility to join and vesting (but not benefit accrual for any purpose other
than vacation pay, sick leave and life insurance) under all employee benefit
plans, programs, policies or similar employment related arrangements of
GlobalSantaFe and its subsidiaries in which the employee is eligible to
participate. GlobalSantaFe will waive, and to the extent necessary to effect the
provisions of the merger agreement, will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the relevant insurance carriers and other third parties to waive, any
restrictions and limitations for medical conditions existing as of the effective
time of the merger of those employees and their dependents who were covered
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger under a group health plan
maintained by Global Marine, but only to the extent that this medical condition
would be covered by GlobalSantaFe's or Global Marine's group health plan if it
were not a pre-existing condition and only to the extent that such limitations
would not have applied under Global Marine's group health plan prior to the
effective time of the merger. At the effective time of the merger, GlobalSantaFe
will cause Global Marine to offer to each employee of Global Marine and its
subsidiaries coverage under a group health plan which credits such employee
towards the deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
imposed under such group health plan, for the year during which the effective
time of the merger (or such later date as the employees participate in such
group health plan) occurs, with any applicable expenses already incurred during
such year under Global Marine's group health plan.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, GlobalSantaFe will continue or cause one
of its subsidiaries to continue the Global Marine Severance Program for
Shorebased Staff Personnel for the benefit of any employee of Global Marine and
its subsidiaries who would be eligible for severance benefits under that plan
due to a qualifying layoff or termination of employment within 12 months after
the effective time of the merger. The rights of certain key employees under the
Global Marine Severance Program for Shorebased Staff Personnel may not be
adversely affected during the 36-month period after the effective time of the
merger.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Santa Fe International and Global Marine
have agreed to cooperate in good faith to establish a process for promptly
integrating their compensation and benefit plans following the effective time of
the merger and to take appropriate and substantially consistent actions to
retain key employees and to provide for a smooth transition.

     Except with respect to offers of employment to new employees in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices, pursuant to the
merger agreement, Santa Fe International and Global Marine have agreed that they
will not make, and they will not permit their respective subsidiaries to make,
any

representations to their employees concerning continued employment following the
effective time of the merger, or the terms and conditions of employment or
benefits offered, other than with the express mutual consent of both Santa Fe
International and Global Marine.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Santa Fe International has agreed that in
the event that annual bonus payments for employees of Global Marine and its
subsidiaries in respect of service during 2001 have not been paid prior to the
effective time of the merger, GlobalSantaFe will pay, or cause its subsidiaries
to pay, the annual bonus in accordance with the terms of the management
incentive award plans.

     Pursuant to the merger agreement, Santa Fe International has agreed to
treat the merger as a change in control with respect to (i) awards made under
the Global Marine stock plans and the Global Marine Non-Employee Director
Restricted Stock Plan, (ii) the Global Marine Severance Program for Shorebased
Staff Personnel, (iii) the employment agreement between Global Marine and Robert
E. Rose, as amended and (iv) the severance agreements between Global Marine and
Messrs. Johnson, Marshall, McCulloch, Ralls, Vrooman, Woolie, and Watson.
GlobalSantaFe will assume the obligations of Global Marine with respect to such
severance agreements.

     Under the merger agreement, GlobalSantaFe will assume the obligations of
Global Marine with respect to the performance stock awards granted to Messrs.
Johnson, Marshall, McCulloch, Ralls, Rose, Vrooman, and Woolie, including the
obligation to accelerate the removal of all conditions, contingencies and other
restrictions from the total number of shares of Global Marine common stock
subject to awards for all employees of Global Marine. Within 10 days following
the effective time of the merger, GlobalSantaFe will issue to each holder of
performance shares identified above, other than any holder who has terminated
employment with Global Marine and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time
of the merger without entitlement to a performance share payment, a number of
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares equal to the number of shares of Global Marine
common stock subject to the performance award, adjusted by the merger ratio.

     GlobalSantaFe will assume the obligation of Global Marine to issue an award
of 250,000 restricted shares of Global Marine common stock to Robert E. Rose, by
the issuance as of the effective time of the merger of a number of GlobalSantaFe
ordinary shares equal to 250,000, adjusted by the merger ratio and subject to
the forfeiture restrictions previously approved by the compensation committee of
the board of directors of Global Marine. None of these restrictions relating to
these restricted shares lapse as a result of the merger.

DIVIDENDS

     The Santa Fe International board of directors has historically made a
determination each quarter as to the payment of dividends. Santa Fe
International has paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.0325 per ordinary share
since the fourth quarter of 1997. On September 11, 2001, the Santa Fe
International board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.0325 per
share payable to holders of record at the close of business on September 28,
2001. We do not currently plan to change this practice after the merger,
including the amount of the per share dividend by GlobalSantaFe after the
merger. Any future declaration and payment of dividends by GlobalSantaFe will be
made at the discretion of its board of directors and will be dependent upon a
variety of factors, including GlobalSantaFe's results of operations, financial
condition, cash requirements, restrictions, if any, contained in its agreements
with creditors and other relevant factors. Any declared dividend will be payable
only out of GlobalSantaFe's profits or share premium account or any other
account permitted by the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision) of the Cayman
Islands in accordance with Cayman Islands law.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND CONSIDERATIONS

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Because the stockholders of Global Marine will own slightly over 50% of
GlobalSantaFe after the merger, Global Marine will be considered the acquiring
entity for financial accounting purposes. Accordingly, the historical basis of
Global Marine in its assets and liabilities will be carried forward to the
financial statements of GlobalSantaFe. The assets and liabilities of Santa Fe
International will be revalued to estimated fair value at the date of the merger
in the financial statements of GlobalSantaFe, with the excess of the purchase
price over the sum of such fair values recorded as goodwill.

The $2.6 billion purchase price is calculated using the estimated number of
Santa Fe International ordinary shares expected to be outstanding immediately
prior to the merger and a $14.67 per share average trading price of Global
Marine common stock, as adjusted for the merger ratio ($22.06 per share, as
adjusted), for a period of time immediately before and after the merger was
announced, plus the estimated fair value of Santa Fe International's outstanding
stock options. The calculated purchase price is for accounting purposes only and
is not indicative of the price at which Santa Fe International ordinary shares
will trade immediately before the completion of the merger or the value of
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares to be received by Global Marine stockholders in
connection with the merger.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
SHAREHOLDERS

  SCOPE OF DISCUSSION

     The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. tax consequences to
Global Marine stockholders of (1) the exchange of Global Marine common stock for
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares in the merger and (2) the subsequent ownership and
disposition of GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares. There are no material U.S. tax
consequences to the historic Santa Fe International shareholders, because their
Santa Fe International ordinary shares remain unchanged by the merger. For a
description of the manner in which the merger will be carried out, see
"-- Exchange of Global Marine Common Stock Certificates for GlobalSantaFe
Ordinary Share Certificates" on page 58 and "The Merger Agreement" on page 68.
This discussion is based upon existing U.S. tax law, including legislation,
regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, as in effect on the
date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect.

     For purposes of this discussion:

     - a "U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner of Global Marine common stock that,
       for U.S. tax purposes, is (1) an individual citizen or resident of the
       United States, (2) a corporation or any other entity taxable as a
       corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United
       States or of a state of the United States or the District of Columbia, or
       (3) a trust or estate treated as a domestic trust or estate;

     - a "non-U.S. holder" is any beneficial owner of Global Marine common stock
       other than a U.S. holder; and

     - the term "U.S. tax" means U.S. federal income tax under the Internal
       Revenue Code.

     This discussion assumes that U.S. holders hold their Global Marine common
stock and the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares which they will receive in the
merger as capital assets. Tax consequences which are different from or in
addition to those here described may apply to U.S. holders who are subject to
special treatment under U.S. tax law, such as:

     - tax-exempt organizations;

     - financial institutions, insurance companies and broker-dealers;

     - persons who hold their Global Marine common stock as part of a hedge,
       straddle, wash sale, synthetic security, conversion transaction or other
       integrated investment comprised of Global Marine common stock and one or
       more other investments;

     - persons who acquired their shares in compensatory transactions;

     - persons who have previously been, but are no longer, citizens or
       residents of the United States;

     - non-U.S. holders who are or have previously been engaged in the conduct
       of a trade or business in the United States; or

     - persons that, after the merger, will own, actually or constructively,
       stock possessing at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all
       GlobalSantaFe stock.

     In the case of a shareholder that is a partnership, determinations as to
tax consequences generally will be made at the partner level, but special
considerations not here set forth may apply. The discussion is limited to

U.S. federal income tax considerations and does not address other U.S. federal
tax considerations or state, local or non-U.S. tax considerations.

     This summary is not a substitute for an individual analysis of the tax
consequences of the merger to a Global Marine stockholder. Each Global Marine
stockholder is urged to consult a tax advisor as to the U.S. tax consequences of
the transaction, including any such consequences arising from the particular
facts and circumstances of the Global Marine stockholder, and as to any estate,
gift, state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences of the transaction.

  MATERIAL U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO U.S. HOLDERS

     Global Marine and Santa Fe International expect the merger to qualify as a
reorganization under section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. However,
because Santa Fe International is not a U.S. corporation, the merger is subject
to special rules under section 367 of the Internal Revenue Code that will, as
discussed below, cause U.S. holders to recognize gain but not loss in most
circumstances. Assuming the merger qualifies as a reorganization under section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to the assumptions and
limitations set forth above in "-- Scope of Discussion":

     - U.S. holders will recognize gain, if any, on the exchange in the merger
       of shares of Global Marine common stock for GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares
       and cash in lieu of fractional shares. A U.S. holder's gain should equal
       the excess of (1) the fair market value of the GlobalSantaFe ordinary
       shares and cash received by the holder in the reorganization over (2) the
       holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of Global Marine common stock
       exchanged for the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares and cash.

     - U.S. holders will not recognize loss, if any, on the exchange in the
       merger of shares of Global Marine common stock for GlobalSantaFe ordinary
       shares (except as discussed below with respect to cash received in lieu
       of fractional shares of GlobalSantaFe). U.S. holders with a loss (other
       than with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares) on their
       shares of Global Marine common stock will, however, be able to carry over
       their basis to their GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares, thus preserving the
       loss.

     - U.S. holders will recognize loss, if any, on a cash payment in the merger
       for a fractional GlobalSantaFe ordinary share in an amount equal to the
       difference between the amount of cash received and the portion of such
       holder's adjusted tax basis in the share of Global Marine common stock
       surrendered that is allocable to the fractional share.

     - The holding period of the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares will commence on
       the day after the date of the merger, except in the case of holders
       realizing a loss (other than with respect to cash received in lieu of
       fractional shares) on the exchange whose holding period will include the
       period those holders held their shares of Global Marine common stock.

     In determining the amount of gain recognized, each share of Global Marine
common stock transferred is to be treated as the subject of a separate exchange.
Accordingly, if a U.S. holder transfers some Global Marine stock on which gains
are realized and other Global Marine stock on which losses are realized, the
U.S. holder may not net losses against gains to determine the amount of gain
recognized.

     Any recognized gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will
constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period is
greater than one year as of the date of the merger. For certain U.S. holders,
including individuals, any such long-term capital gain generally will be taxed
at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.

     The tax basis of the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares will be equal to their
fair market value on the date of the reorganization, except in the case of U.S.
holders realizing a loss (other than with respect to cash received in lieu of
fractional shares) on the exchange, whose tax basis will be the same as the tax
basis of their Global Marine common stock.

     All U.S. holders should be aware that certain reporting requirements apply
to a reorganization under section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code. Although the
merger is subject to special rules under section 367 of

the Internal Revenue Code, U.S. holders are not subject to any separate
reporting requirements with respect to the merger under section 367, assuming
that gain recognized under the rules described above is properly reported.

  MATERIAL U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES TO U.S. HOLDERS OF OWNING AND DISPOSING OF
  GLOBALSANTAFE ORDINARY SHARES

     General.  The following is a discussion of the material U.S. tax
consequences of the ownership and disposition of GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares
received by U.S. holders in the merger. The discussion is subject to the
assumptions and limitations set forth above in "-- Scope of Discussion."

     Distributions on and Sale of the GlobalSantaFe Ordinary Shares.  U.S.
holders will be required to include in gross income as ordinary income the gross
amount of any distribution on the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares, to the extent
that the distribution is paid out of GlobalSantaFe's current or accumulated
earnings and profits as determined for U.S. tax purposes (a "dividend"). These
dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction, which
generally is allowed to United States corporate shareholders on dividends
received from a domestic corporation. Distributions in excess of current and
accumulated earnings and profits will be applied first to reduce the U.S.
holder's tax basis in the holder's shares, and thereafter will constitute gain
from a sale or other taxable disposition of the shares.

     Although, for foreign tax credit purposes, dividends paid by a foreign
corporation generally are foreign source income, under section 904(g) of the
Internal Revenue Code, dividends paid by a foreign corporation that is treated
as more than 50% owned by United States persons may be treated as U.S. source
income for foreign tax credit purposes, to the extent that the foreign
corporation itself has more than an insignificant amount of U.S. source income.
A portion of the dividends paid by GlobalSantaFe could be treated as U.S. source
income under section 904(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.

     A U.S. holder of GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares generally will recognize
gain or loss for U.S. tax purposes upon the sale or other taxable disposition of
such shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized
from such sale or other taxable disposition and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax
basis in such shares. Such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss and, in
the case of certain U.S. holders, including individuals, any such gain would be
subject to U.S. tax at a maximum rate of 20% if the U.S. holder's holding period
for the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares at the time of the sale or other taxable
disposition exceeds one year. Such gain or loss generally will be United States
source gain or loss for foreign tax credit purposes. The deduction of capital
losses is subject to limitation under U.S. tax law.

     Special Rules for Passive Foreign Investment Companies.  For U.S. tax
purposes, a foreign corporation, such as GlobalSantaFe, is classified as a
passive foreign investment company (a "PFIC") for each taxable year in which
either (1) 75% or more of its gross income is passive income (as defined for
U.S. tax purposes) or (2) on average for such taxable year, 50% or more in value
of its assets produce passive income or are held for the production of passive
income. For purposes of applying the tests in the preceding sentence, the
foreign corporation is deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of
and to receive directly its proportionate share of the income of any other
corporation of which the foreign corporation owns, directly or indirectly, at
least 25% by value of the stock. Under the Internal Revenue Code, passive income
generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents (other than rents and
royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and not derived
from a related person), gains from the disposition of passive assets and gains
from commodities transactions, other than gains derived from "qualified active
sales" of commodities and "qualified hedging transactions" involving commodities
within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations (the "Commodity
Exception").

     Based upon estimates with respect to its income, assets and operations,
GlobalSantaFe believes that it will not be a PFIC immediately following the
merger, and it does not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future.
However, since the determination of PFIC status will be made on an annual basis,
and will depend upon the composition of the income and assets of GlobalSantaFe
and its subsidiaries, and the nature of the activities of GlobalSantaFe and its
subsidiaries (including the ability to qualify for the Commodity Exception),
from time to time, there can be no assurance that GlobalSantaFe will not be
considered a PFIC

for any taxable year. Moreover, an opinion of counsel will not be obtained, and
a ruling will not be sought from the IRS, regarding the PFIC determination for
GlobalSantaFe.

     Classification of a foreign corporation as a PFIC can have various adverse
U.S. tax consequences to U.S. holders. These include taxation of gain on a sale
or other disposition of the shares of the corporation (possibly including a
disposition by way of gift or exchange in a corporate reorganization, or the
grant of the stock as security for a loan) at ordinary income rates and
imposition of an interest charge on gain or on distributions with respect to the
shares. Accordingly, if GlobalSantaFe is classified as a PFIC, such
classification could change the tax consequences of distributions and sales or
exchanges described above. Moreover, a step-up in the tax basis of the stock of
a PFIC may not be available upon the death of an individual U.S. holder.

     If GlobalSantaFe should determine in the future that it is a PFIC, it will
endeavor to so notify U.S. holders, although there can be no assurance that it
will be able to do so in a timely and complete manner. U.S. holders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors about the PFIC rules, including the availability
of certain elections.

     United States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.  Dividends on
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares paid within the United States or through certain
U.S.-related financial intermediaries will be subject to information reporting
and may be subject to backup withholding (currently at a 30.5% rate) unless the
holder: (1) is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (2) provides a
taxpayer identification number and certifies that no loss of exemption from
back-up withholding has occurred. Information reporting requirements and backup
withholding also may apply to the cash proceeds of a sale of the GlobalSantaFe
ordinary shares. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules may be credited against a U.S. holder's U.S.
tax liability, and a holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund
with the Internal Revenue Service.

  MATERIAL U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS

     A non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding
tax on any gain recognized on an exchange of shares of Global Marine common
stock in the merger, or a sale or other disposition of GlobalSantaFe ordinary
shares, as long as:

     - such gain is not effectively connected with the conduct by the holder of
       a trade or business within the United States or, if a tax treaty applies,
       is not attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained
       by the holder in the United States;

     - in the case of certain capital gains, the holder either is not present in
       the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year in which
       the capital gain is recognized or otherwise qualifies for an exemption;

     - the holder qualifies for an exemption from backup withholding, as
       discussed below; and

     - in the case of Global Marine common stock exchanged in the merger, either
       (i) Global Marine is not and has not been a "U.S. real property holding
       corporation" within the meaning of section 897(c)(2) of the Internal
       Revenue Code at any time within the shorter of the five-year period
       preceding the merger or such non-U.S. holder's holding period or (ii) the
       holder does not hold, and has not held at any time during the five years
       preceding the merger, more than 5% of the Global Marine common stock.

Global Marine does not believe that it is or has been within the last five years
a "U.S. real property holding corporation."

     A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. tax on
distributions made by GlobalSantaFe on the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares,
provided that such distributions are not effectively connected with the conduct
by the holder of a trade or business within the United States or, if a tax
treaty applies, are not attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base
maintained by the holder in the United States. In

order to qualify for an exemption from backup withholding tax on dividends on
and gain from dispositions of the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares, a non-U.S.
holder may be required to certify the holder's foreign status or otherwise
establish an exemption.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine must make filings and receive
clearances from various governmental agencies, both in the United States and
internationally, to complete the merger. These filings, notifications and
clearances relate primarily to antitrust and securities law issues. Santa Fe
International and Global Marine intend to pursue vigorously all required
regulatory clearances. Although all of the required clearances have not yet been
received, Santa Fe International and Global Marine anticipate that they will
receive regulatory clearances sufficient to complete the merger immediately
following the shareholder meetings. Neither Santa Fe International nor Global
Marine can assure you that it will obtain all required clearances by the time of
its respective shareholder meeting or at all. In addition, neither Santa Fe
International nor Global Marine can assure you that governmental authorities
will not impose unfavorable conditions for granting the required clearances.

     Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,
the parties cannot complete the merger until they have notified and furnished
information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice and a specified waiting period expires or is
terminated early. Santa Fe International and Global Marine made their filings
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on September 14, 2001 and received notice of
early termination of the waiting period on September 27, 2001; however, this
clearance process does not have the effect of conferring antitrust immunity.

     Other countries and U.S. states in which Santa Fe International or Global
Marine has operations also may review the merger under their antitrust laws. The
parties have voluntarily notified the U.K. competition authorities of their
intent to enter into the merger, and have furnished information to the U.K.
competition authorities regarding the transaction. The U.K. competition
authorities have up to 35 business days to review the transaction and make a
determination whether or not to refer the merger to the Competition Commission.
If the U.K. competition authorities determine not to refer the merger to the
Competition Commission, this review period will expire on November 2, 2001. The
parties have also notified the Brazilian Antitrust Authority (CADE) of their
intent to merge.

     At any time before the completion of the merger, any of the relevant
governmental authorities or a private person or entity could seek under
antitrust laws, among other things, to enjoin the merger or to cause Santa Fe
International or Global Marine to divest assets or businesses as a condition to
completing the merger. Neither Santa Fe International nor Global Marine can
assure you that a challenge to the merger will not be made or, if a challenge is
made, that Santa Fe International or Global Marine will prevail.

     Furthermore, any of the relevant governmental authorities or a private
person or entity could seek, under antitrust laws, to take action against
GlobalSantaFe after the completion of the merger. Santa Fe International and
Global Marine are unable to predict whether any action will be taken or what the
outcome of any action may be.

     Each party's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the condition
that no statute, rule or regulation shall have been enacted by any governmental
authority prohibiting or making unlawful the consummation of the merger. Each
party's obligation to complete the merger is also subject to the condition that
no decree, order or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, U.S. or
non-U.S., prohibits the consummation of the merger. The parties have agreed,
however, that before invoking this condition, they will comply with the covenant
in the merger agreement described in the following paragraph. The parties have
agreed that, with respect to matters not addressed in such covenant, they will
use reasonable best efforts to have the decree, order or injunction lifted or
vacated before invoking the condition. The parties have also conditioned the
completion of the merger on the following:

     - any waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the
       Hart-Scott-Rodino Act shall have expired or been terminated (this
       condition was satisfied on September 27, 2001);

     - the absence of any pending or threatened claim, proceeding or action by
       any agency of the government of the United States, the United Kingdom or
       of the European Union seeking to restrain, prohibit or rescind any
       transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as an actual or
       threatened violation of any antitrust law, as applicable, or seeking to
       penalize a party for completing any such transaction which in any case
       is, in the reasonable judgment of either Santa Fe International or Global
       Marine, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
       GlobalSantaFe after the completion of the merger;

     - in the event of any review by the U.K. Office of Fair Trading or, if
       applicable, the U.K. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the
       parties shall have received indications reasonably satisfactory to each
       of Santa Fe International and Global Marine that the merger will not be
       referred to the Competition Commission or, if the merger is referred to
       the Competition Commission, indications reasonably satisfactory to each
       of Global Marine and Santa Fe International that the merger can proceed;

     - the expiration or termination of any mandatory waiting period under any
       applicable non-U.S. antitrust laws if the failure to observe the waiting
       period would, in the reasonable judgment of either Santa Fe International
       or Global Marine, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
       effect on GlobalSantaFe after the completion of the merger; and

     - the absence of any final or preliminary administrative order denying
       approval of or prohibiting the merger, issued by a governmental authority
       with jurisdiction to enforce applicable non-U.S. antitrust laws, which
       order is, in the reasonable judgment of either Santa Fe International or
       Global Marine, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
       GlobalSantaFe after the completion of the merger.

     Under the merger agreement, the parties have agreed: to make their
respective required filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and any applicable
non-U.S. antitrust laws, to use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate in
determining which filings are required to be made and which consents, approvals,
permits or authorizations in connection with the execution and delivery of the
merger agreement will need to be obtained prior to the completion of the merger,
and to make all such filings and seek all such consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations in a timely manner and to furnish each other with necessary
information and reasonable assistance in so doing. Under the merger agreement,
the parties must use their reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps
necessary to gain any consents or to eliminate any impediments to the merger.
Under the merger agreement, neither Santa Fe International nor Global Marine is
required to dispose of any assets or to limit its freedom of action with respect
to any of its businesses, whether prior to or at the effective time of the
merger, or to commit or agree to obtain any consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations or to remove any antitrust-related impediments to the completion
of the merger, or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunctions, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding relating to antitrust laws, other than dispositions, limitations or
consents, commitments or agreements that in each such case may be conditioned
upon the consummation of the merger and the transactions contemplated thereby
and that in each such case do not and are not reasonably likely, individually or
in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on GlobalSantaFe and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole as constituted after the effective time of the
merger.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES; RESALE RESTRICTIONS

     All of the following securities will be freely transferable, except for
restrictions applicable to "affiliates" of Global Marine under the Securities
Act of 1933:

     - all GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares issued to Global Marine's stockholders
       in the merger,

     - all GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares issued pursuant to Global Marine
       performance stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger, and

     - all GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares issued upon exercise of options to
       purchase Global Marine common stock outstanding at the effective time of
       the merger.

     Affiliates may resell those shares they receive only in transactions
permitted by Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 or as otherwise permitted
under the Securities Act of 1933. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates of
Global Marine for these purposes generally include individuals or entities that
control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, Global Marine, and
would not generally include securityholders who are not executive officers,
directors or significant shareholders of Global Marine.

     The merger agreement requires Global Marine to prepare and deliver prior to
the completion of the merger a list that identifies all persons whom Global
Marine believes may be deemed to be affiliates of Global Marine for purposes of
Rule 145. Global Marine is also required, pursuant to the merger agreement, to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person it identifies on the list
as a potential affiliate to deliver to Santa Fe International, at or prior to
the completion of the merger, a written agreement that the affiliate will not
sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the GlobalSantaFe ordinary
shares issued to the affiliate pursuant to the merger unless the sale, pledge,
transfer or other disposition meets one of the following criteria:

     - it is made pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under
       the Securities Act of 1933;

     - it is in compliance with Rule 145; or

     - is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of
GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares, and no person is authorized to make any use of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus in connection with any resale.

RIGHTS OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS

  GLOBAL MARINE STOCKHOLDERS

     Global Marine stockholders will not be entitled to any appraisal rights
under the General Corporation Law of Delaware or any other applicable law in
connection with the merger.

  SANTA FE INTERNATIONAL SHAREHOLDERS

     Santa Fe International shareholders will not be entitled to any appraisal
rights under the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision) of the Cayman Islands or

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

     The GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares to be issued to Global Marine's
stockholders in the merger will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
subject to official notice of issuance. The completion of the merger is
conditioned upon the New York Stock Exchange's authorization for listing. The
ordinary shares will trade under the ticker symbol "GSF."

DELISTING AND DEREGISTRATION OF GLOBAL MARINE COMMON STOCK AFTER THE MERGER

     When the merger is completed, Global Marine common stock will be delisted
from the New York Stock Exchange and will be deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     The following summary of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is incorporated
by reference and attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
We urge you to read the full text of the merger agreement.

     At the effective time of the merger, Gold Merger Sub, a Delaware
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Silver Sub, will merge into
Global Marine, with Global Marine surviving as a direct subsidiary of Silver
Sub, which is a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Santa Fe
International. Santa Fe International will be renamed GlobalSantaFe Corporation
at the time of the merger. As a result, following the merger, Global Marine will
be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe. The closing of the
merger will take place as soon as practicable after all of the conditions to the
merger described in "-- Conditions to the Merger" are fulfilled or waived. The
merger will be effective at the time Santa Fe International and Global Marine
file the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at a later time as they agree and designate in the certificate of
merger.

     In the merger, each holder of shares of Global Marine common stock will
receive, for each share of Global Marine common stock the holder owns, a number
of GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares equal to 0.665 times the number of shares of
Global Marine common stock held. The parties expect there will be approximately
115 million outstanding Santa Fe International ordinary shares and approximately
177 million shares of Global Marine common stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the effective time of the merger.

     Each option to purchase shares of Global Marine common stock granted to
Global Marine employees and directors under Global Marine's stock option plans
that is outstanding and not yet exercised before completing the merger will
become an option to purchase GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares. See "The
Merger -- Conversion of Stock Options and Assumption of Stock Plans."

     If Santa Fe International changes the number of its issued ordinary shares
or Global Marine changes the number of its issued and outstanding shares of
common stock, in either case as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction, before the
completion of the merger, Santa Fe International and Global Marine will adjust
the merger ratio appropriately.

  NO SOLICITATION

     Global Marine has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall,
and it shall not permit any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives to, directly or indirectly: solicit, initiate or encourage, or
take any action designed to facilitate, any inquiry, proposal or offer with
respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or similar
transaction involving 15% or more of the consolidated assets, net revenues or
net income of Global Marine; or 15% or more of any class of capital stock of
Global Marine, including any merger or similar transaction in which 15% or more
of Global Marine's capital stock is issued to a third party or its stockholders.

     Any such proposal, offer or transaction may be referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as a "Global Marine acquisition proposal."

     Global Marine has agreed not to cooperate with, assist, participate or
engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning a Global Marine acquisition
proposal. Global Marine has agreed to cease immediately and terminate any
existing negotiations with any parties with respect to any of the foregoing.
However, nothing contained in the merger agreement prevents Global Marine or the
Global Marine board of directors from:

     - complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
       of 1934 with regard to a Global Marine acquisition proposal; or

     - before Global Marine's stockholders approve the merger, providing
       information to or engaging in any negotiations with any person who has
       made an unsolicited bona fide written Global Marine acquisition proposal
       with respect to all the outstanding shares of Global Marine common stock
       or all or substantially all the assets of Global Marine (or a merger or
       similar transaction in which 40% or more of Global Marine's capital stock
       is issued to a third party or its stockholders) that, in the good faith
       judgment of the board of directors of Global Marine, taking into account
       the likelihood of financing and consummation, after consultation with a
       financial advisor of recognized national reputation, is superior to the
       merger, if the board of directors of Global Marine, after consultation
       with its outside legal counsel, determines that the failure to do so
       would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

     If Global Marine intends to participate in any such discussions or
negotiations or to provide any information to any third party, Global Marine is
required to:

     - give prompt prior oral and written notice to Santa Fe International of
       each such action;

     - immediately notify Santa Fe International orally and in writing of any
       requests for information or the receipt of any Global Marine acquisition
       proposal or inquiry with respect to or that could lead to a Global Marine
       acquisition proposal, including the identity of the person or group (1)
       engaging in such discussions or negotiations, (2) requesting such
       information or (3) making such Global Marine acquisition proposal, and
       the material terms and conditions of any Global Marine acquisition
       proposal;

     - keep Santa Fe International fully informed on a timely basis of the
       status and details, including any changes or proposed changes to such
       status or details, of any such requests, Global Marine acquisition
       proposals or inquiries; and

     - provide to Santa Fe International as soon as practicable after receipt or
       delivery thereof, copies of all correspondence and other written material
       sent or provided to Global Marine from any third party, or sent or
       provided by Global Marine to any third party, in connection with any
       Global Marine acquisition proposal.

     Santa Fe International has agreed that neither it nor any of its
subsidiaries shall, and it shall not permit any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives to, directly or indirectly: solicit,
initiate or encourage, or take any action designed to facilitate, any inquiry,
proposal or offer with respect to a tender or exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or similar transaction involving 15% or more of the consolidated
assets, net revenues or net income of Santa Fe International; or 15% or more of
any class of share capital of Santa Fe International, including any merger or
similar transaction in which 15% or more of Santa Fe International's share
capital is issued to a third party or its shareholders.

     Any such proposal, offer or transaction may be referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as a "Santa Fe acquisition proposal."

     Santa Fe International has agreed not to cooperate with or engage in any
discussions or negotiations concerning a Santa Fe acquisition proposal. Santa Fe
International has agreed to cease immediately and terminate any existing
negotiations with any parties with respect to any of the foregoing. However,
nothing contained in the merger agreement prevents Santa Fe International or the
Santa Fe International board of directors from:

     - complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
       of 1934 with regard to a Santa Fe acquisition proposal; or

     - before Santa Fe International obtains the shareholder votes required in
       connection with the merger, providing information to or engaging in any
       negotiations with any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
       written Santa Fe acquisition proposal with respect to all the issued
       Santa Fe International ordinary shares or all or substantially all the
       assets of Santa Fe International (or a merger or similar transaction in
       which 40% or more of Santa Fe International's share capital is issued to
       a third party or its shareholders) that, in the good faith judgment of
       the board of directors of Santa Fe International, taking into account the
       likelihood of financing and consummation, after consultation with a
       financial advisor of recognized national reputation, is superior to the
       merger, if the board of directors of Santa Fe International, after
       consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines that the failure
       to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

     If Santa Fe International intends to participate in any such discussions or
negotiations or provide any information to any third party, Santa Fe
International is required to:

     - give prompt prior oral and written notice to Global Marine of each such
       action;

     - immediately notify Global Marine orally and in writing of any requests
       for information or the receipt of any Santa Fe acquisition proposal or
       inquiry with respect to or that could lead to a Santa Fe acquisition
       proposal, including the identity of the person or group (1) engaging in
       such discussions or negotiations,

       (2) requesting such information or (3) making such Santa Fe acquisition
       proposal, and the material terms and conditions of any Santa Fe
       acquisition proposal;

     - keep Global Marine fully informed on a timely basis of the status and
       details, including any changes or proposed changes to such status or
       details, of any such requests, Santa Fe acquisition proposals or
       inquiries; and

     - provide to Global Marine as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
       thereof, copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
       provided to Santa Fe International from any third party, or sent or
       provided by Santa Fe International to any third party, in connection with
       any Santa Fe acquisition proposal.

  COVENANT TO CALL SHAREHOLDER MEETING AND TO RECOMMEND MERGER-RELATED PROPOSALS

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine have agreed to call meetings of
their respective shareholders to consider and vote upon the merger-related
proposals. Each of Santa Fe International and Global Marine, through its board
of directors, has agreed to recommend approval of the merger-related proposals
and to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its respective
shareholders proxies in favor of such proposals. However, prior to the effective
time of the merger, the board of directors of each party may withdraw, modify or
change any recommendation and declaration regarding such matters or recommend a
superior proposal to acquire such board's company, if, in the good faith opinion
of such board of directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, a
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

agreement, no event or occurrence shall have occurred that has had or is likely

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Global Marine and Santa Fe International may terminate the merger agreement
by mutual written consent.

     Either the Global Marine board of directors or the Santa Fe International
board of directors may terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the parties have not completed the merger by March 31, 2002, and the
       party desiring to terminate the merger agreement for this reason has not
       failed to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
       obligations under the merger agreement in any manner that caused the
       merger not to occur on or before that date;

     - at a meeting of the stockholders of Global Marine, those stockholders do
       not adopt the merger agreement;

     - at a meeting of the shareholders of Santa Fe International, those
       shareholders do not approve the proposed amendments to Santa Fe
       International's memorandum of association and articles of association, or
       the issuance of ordinary shares in the merger; or

     - a U.S. federal or state or non-U.S. court of competent jurisdiction or
       U.S. federal or state or non-U.S. governmental, regulatory or
       administrative agency or commission has issued an order, decree or ruling
       or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
       prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and
       such order, decree, ruling or other action has become final and
       unappealable. However, the party seeking to terminate the merger
       agreement for this reason must have complied with the covenants in the
       merger agreement which relate to antitrust, tax and other governmental
       filings and approvals and, with respect to other matters, must have used
       its reasonable best efforts to remove such injunction, decree or order.

     The Global Marine board of directors may terminate the merger agreement if:

     - Santa Fe International, Silver Sub or Gold Merger Sub has breached any
       representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement,
       or any representation or warranty of Santa Fe International, Silver Sub
       or Gold Merger Sub has become untrue, in either case such that a
       condition to the merger would not be satisfied, and such breach is not
       curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 days after Global Marine
       gives written notice of the breach to Santa Fe International, and Global
       Marine is not, at that time, in material breach of any representation,
       warranty, covenant or agreement in the merger agreement; or

     - the board of directors of Santa Fe International has withdrawn or
       materially modified, in a manner adverse to Global Marine, its approval
       or recommendation of the amendments to its memorandum of association and
       articles of association or the issuance of ordinary shares pursuant to
       the merger, or recommended a competing acquisition proposal for Santa Fe
       International, or resolved to do so.

     In addition, the Global Marine board of directors may terminate the merger
agreement before the Global Marine stockholders adopt the merger agreement if:

     - Global Marine receives a superior proposal for Global Marine and the
       board of directors of Global Marine determines:

        - after consultation with its outside legal advisors that proceeding
          with the merger would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
          by reason of the superior proposal; and

        - that there is a substantial likelihood that the adoption by Global
          Marine's stockholders of the merger agreement with Santa Fe
          International will not be obtained by reason of the existence of the
          superior proposal for Global Marine; and

     - the Global Marine board of directors concurrently approves, and Global
       Marine concurrently enters into, a binding definitive agreement providing
       for the implementation of a superior proposal for Global Marine.

     However, Global Marine may not effect that termination unless:

     - Global Marine has complied in all material respects with the
       non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement;

     - Santa Fe International receives at least five business days' prior
       written notice from Global Marine of its intention to effect that
       termination, and during that five business day period, Global Marine
       considers, and causes its respective financial and legal advisors to
       consider, any adjustment in the terms and conditions of the merger
       agreement that Santa Fe International may propose; and

     - Global Marine has paid to Santa Fe International the $120 million
       termination fee described under "-- Expenses and Termination Fees."

     The Santa Fe International board of directors may terminate the merger
agreement if:

     - Global Marine has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or
       agreement in the merger agreement, or any representation or warranty of
       Global Marine has become untrue, in either case such that a condition to
       the merger would not be satisfied, and such breach is not curable or, if
       curable, is not cured within 30 days after Santa Fe International gives
       written notice of the breach to Global Marine, and Santa Fe International
       is not, at that time, in material breach of any representation, warranty,
       covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement; or

     - the board of directors of Global Marine has withdrawn or materially
       modified, in a manner adverse to Santa Fe International, its approval or
       recommendation of the merger or recommended a competing acquisition
       proposal for Global Marine, or resolved to do so.

     In addition, the Santa Fe International board of directors may terminate
the merger agreement before the Santa Fe International shareholders approve the
amendments to its memorandum of association, including the change of Santa Fe
International's name to GlobalSantaFe Corporation and the proposed amendments to
the and articles of association, and the issuance of its ordinary shares
pursuant to the merger if:

     - Santa Fe International receives a superior proposal for Santa Fe
       International and the board of directors of Santa Fe International
       determines:

        - after consultation with its outside legal advisors that proceeding
          with the merger would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
          by reason of the superior proposal; and

        - that there is a substantial likelihood that the adoption by Santa Fe
          International's shareholders of the merger agreement with Global
          Marine will not be obtained by reason of the existence of the superior
          proposal for Santa Fe International; and

     - the Santa Fe International board of directors concurrently approves, and
       Santa Fe International concurrently enters into, a binding definitive
       agreement providing for the implementation of a superior proposal for
       Santa Fe International.

     However, Santa Fe International may not effect that termination unless:

     - Santa Fe International has complied in all material respects with the
       non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement;

     - Global Marine receives at least five business days' prior written notice
       from Santa Fe International of its intention to effect that termination,
       and during that five business day period, Santa Fe International
       considers, and causes its respective financial and legal advisors to
       consider, any adjustment in the terms and conditions of the merger
       agreement that Global Marine may propose; and

     - Santa Fe International has paid to Global Marine the $120 million
       termination fee described under "-- Expenses and Termination Fees."

     No party may terminate the merger agreement after the completion of the
merger.

EXPENSES AND TERMINATION FEES

     Whether or not the merger is completed, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring those expenses, except as
expressly provided in the merger agreement.

     Global Marine is required to pay Santa Fe International a cash termination
fee of $120 million at the time of the termination if the merger agreement is
terminated as follows:

     - by Global Marine or Santa Fe International because Global Marine's common
       stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement after the public
       announcement of a competing acquisition proposal for Global Marine,
       whether or not that proposal is still pending or has been consummated;

     - by Santa Fe International because the board of directors of Global Marine
       has withdrawn or materially modified, in a manner adverse to Santa Fe
       International, its approval or recommendation of the merger or
       recommended a competing acquisition proposal for Global Marine, or
       resolved to do so; or

     - by Global Marine because the board of directors of Global Marine
       determines that proceeding with the merger would be inconsistent with its
       fiduciary duties and concurrently enters into a binding definitive
       agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a superior proposal
       for Global Marine.

     Santa Fe International is required to pay Global Marine a cash termination
fee of $120 million at the time of the termination if the merger agreement is
terminated as follows:

     - by Global Marine or Santa Fe International because Santa Fe
       International's shareholders do not approve the amendments to its
       memorandum of association and articles of association and the issuance of
       Santa Fe International ordinary shares pursuant to the merger after the
       public announcement of a competing acquisition proposal for Santa Fe
       International, whether or not that proposal is still pending or has been
       consummated;

     - by Global Marine because the board of directors of Santa Fe International
       has withdrawn or materially modified, in a manner adverse to Global
       Marine, its approval or recommendation of the amendments to its
       memorandum of association and articles of association or the issuance of
       ordinary shares or recommended a competing acquisition proposal for
       Global Marine, or resolved to do so; or

     - by Santa Fe International because the board of directors of Santa Fe
       International determines that proceeding with the merger would be
       inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and concurrently enters into a
       binding definitive agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a
       superior proposal for Santa Fe International.

     If the merger agreement is terminated because the stockholders of Global
Marine do not approve the merger and there is no public announcement of a
competing acquisition proposal for Global Marine before the shareholders' vote,
then Global Marine is required to pay Santa Fe International a fee of $10
million to reimburse it for its costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the merger and related transactions.

     If the merger agreement is terminated because the shareholders of Santa Fe
International do not approve the amendments to its memorandum of association and
articles of association or the issuance of the ordinary shares in the merger and
there is no public announcement of a competing acquisition proposal for Santa Fe
International before the shareholders' vote, then Santa Fe is required to pay
Global Marine a fee of $10 million to reimburse it for its costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the merger and related transactions.

AMENDMENT

     The parties may amend the merger agreement, by action taken or authorized
by their boards of directors, at any time before or after approval by the
shareholders of the parties of the matters presented in connection with the
merger. After any shareholder approval, the parties may not amend the merger
agreement if the law requires further approval by those shareholders, unless
such further approval is obtained.

                           THE SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

     The following summary of the shareholder agreement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the shareholder agreement, which
is incorporated by reference and attached as Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. We urge you to read the full text of the shareholder
agreement.

     SFIC Holdings is a significant shareholder of Santa Fe by virtue of its
ownership of 43,500,000 Santa Fe International ordinary shares, representing
approximately 37.7% of the outstanding Santa Fe International ordinary shares.
SFIC Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. In
order to induce Global Marine to enter into the merger agreement with Santa Fe
International, SFIC Holdings concurrently entered into a shareholder agreement
with Global Marine. In the shareholder agreement, SFIC Holdings has agreed to
vote its 43,500,000 Santa Fe International ordinary shares:

     - in favor of the issuance of Santa Fe International ordinary shares and
       the approval of the amendments to Santa Fe International 's memorandum of
       association and articles of association;

     - against any Santa Fe acquisition proposal (as described under "The Merger
       Agreement -- No Solicitation" on page 73) or any transaction or proposal
       that is inconsistent with, or might hinder, delay, impede or frustrate
       the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     Under the shareholder agreement, SFIC Holdings is only required to vote its
shares in the manner described above at any meeting of the shareholders of Santa
Fe International held prior to the earliest of (i) the effective time of the
merger, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement and (iii) the date on which
the board of directors of Santa Fe International, without the vote of members
employed by Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, withdraws its recommendation of the
merger in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

     In addition, SFIC Holdings has agreed that it and its subsidiaries will
not, and will not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees,
partners, agents, affiliates (other than Santa Fe International) or other
representatives to, and on becoming aware of it will stop such person from
continuing to, directly or indirectly:

     - solicit, initiate or encourage or take any action designed to facilitate,
       directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any
       proposal or offer to Santa Fe International shareholders) with respect to
       a Santa Fe acquisition proposal; or

     - cooperate with or assist, participate or engage in any discussions or
       negotiations concerning a Santa Fe acquisition proposal.

     SFIC Holdings has agreed that, while the merger agreement remains in
effect, it will promptly notify Global Marine of any requests for information in
connection with, or the receipt of, any Santa Fe acquisition proposal or any
inquiry with respect to or that could lead to a Santa Fe acquisition proposal
directed to SFIC Holdings. SFIC Holdings will keep Global Marine fully informed
of the status and details (including any

changes or proposed changes to such status or details) on a timely basis of any
such requests, Santa Fe acquisition proposals or inquiries and provide Global
Marine with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to SFIC Holdings from any third party in connection with any Santa Fe
acquisition proposal or sent or provided by SFIC Holdings to any third party in
connection with any Santa Fe acquisition proposal.

     SFIC Holdings has also agreed that, while the merger agreement remains in
effect, it will not enter into any agreement with any person that provides for,
or could reasonably be expected to materially facilitate, or is designed to
facilitate, a Santa Fe acquisition proposal.

     Kuwait Petroleum Corporation has agreed to be bound by the nonsolicitation
provisions of the shareholder agreement.

              THE CONSENT AND AMENDMENT TO INTERCOMPANY AGREEMENT

     The following summary of the consent and amendment to intercompany
agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the
consent and amendment to intercompany agreement, which is incorporated by
reference and attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We
urge you to read the full text of the consent and amendment to intercompany
agreement.

     In connection with the initial public offering of Santa Fe International,
Santa Fe International entered into an intercompany agreement with Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation and SFIC Holdings. The intercompany agreement requires
Santa Fe International to obtain the consent of SFIC Holdings to significant
corporate actions by Santa Fe International, including the issuance of equity
securities, the sale of assets in excess of $50 million, the incurrence of
indebtedness in excess of $250 million or the change of corporate domicile by
Santa Fe International or any of its subsidiaries, until Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation and its affiliates cease to own 25% of all of the outstanding voting
shares of GlobalSantaFe. The intercompany agreement also provides for the
management and allocation of specified liabilities relating to Santa Fe
International's former non-drilling activities, the registration under the
Securities Act of 1933 of ordinary shares held by SFIC Holdings and other
matters, including advance access to financial and other information. The
registration rights of SFIC Holdings set forth in the intercompany agreement are
not affected by the consent and amendment to intercompany agreement.

     Upon completion of the merger, SFIC Holdings will hold approximately 18.6%
of the outstanding ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe. In connection with the
merger, Santa Fe International, SFIC Holdings and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation
have entered into a consent and amendment to intercompany agreement. Under the
consent and amendment, SFIC Holdings and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation have
irrevocably consented to the issuance by Santa Fe International of the ordinary
shares contemplated by the merger agreement and the performance by Santa Fe
International of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
The consent and amendment limits the requirement for the consent of SFIC
Holdings in connection with significant corporate actions by Santa Fe
International to the requirement for the consent of SFIC Holdings in connection
with the reincorporation of GlobalSantaFe or any existing subsidiary of
GlobalSantaFe or the incorporation of a new subsidiary. The consent and
amendment also provides SFIC Holdings the right to designate three
representatives to the GlobalSantaFe board of directors and provides SFIC
Holdings rights to access information concerning Santa Fe International.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

     As of the effective time of the merger, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation,
acting through SFIC Holdings, is entitled to designate three representatives to
be board of directors of GlobalSantaFe, who must be reasonably acceptable to
Santa Fe International. As long as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its
affiliates own at least 12.5% of the outstanding ordinary shares or at least
12.5% of the outstanding voting shares, SFIC Holdings will have the right to
designate for election three directors of GlobalSantaFe. If SFIC Holdings'
interest is reduced to less than 12.5% and equal to or greater than 7.5%, the
number of directors that SFIC Holdings will have the right to designate for
election will be reduced from three to two. If SFIC Holdings' interest is

reduced to less than 7.5% and equal to or greater than 4%, the number of
directors that SFIC Holdings may designate for election will be reduced from two
to one. If SFIC Holdings' interest is reduced to less than 4%, it will not have
the right to designate any directors for election to the board of GlobalSantaFe.
For purposes of determining SFIC Holdings' rights to board representation, until
SFIC Holdings sells any GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares, only ordinary shares
outstanding at the effective time of the merger are included in the calculation
of the ownership percentage. Accordingly, reductions in SFIC Holdings'
percentage ownership in GlobalSantaFe as a result of GlobalSantaFe's issuance of
shares for any reason following the merger will not reduce SFIC Holdings' board
representation.

     As long as SFIC Holdings has the right to designate a representative to the
board of directors of GlobalSantaFe (i) if a designee of SFIC Holdings ceases to
serve as a director on the board of directors of GlobalSantaFe for any reason,
GlobalSantaFe will cause the vacancy to be filled by another SFIC Holdings
designee, and (ii) SFIC Holdings has the right to appoint one of its designees
to serve as a member of each committee of the board of directors of
GlobalSantaFe, subject to any applicable law or regulation of the New York Stock
Exchange.

SFIC HOLDINGS' CONSENT

     As long as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates, in the
aggregate, own at least 10% of all of the outstanding ordinary shares or at
least 10% of all the outstanding voting shares of GlobalSantaFe, the consent of
SFIC Holdings is required to change the jurisdiction of any existing subsidiary
of GlobalSantaFe or incorporate a new subsidiary in any jurisdiction in a manner
materially adversely affecting the rights or interests of Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation and its affiliates or reincorporate GlobalSantaFe in another
jurisdiction.

               UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SOURCES OF INFORMATION

     Santa Fe International and Global Marine are providing the following
unaudited pro forma combined financial statements to help you in your analysis
of the financial aspects of the merger. The unaudited pro forma combined
financial statements are based upon the historical financial information of
Global Marine and Santa Fe International and should be read in conjunction with
the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Global
Marine and Santa Fe International incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 125.

HOW WE PREPARED THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet has been
prepared as if the merger had occurred on June 30, 2001. The unaudited condensed
pro forma combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000
and the six months ended June 30, 2001 have been prepared as if the merger had
occurred on January 1, 2000.

     If Global Marine and Santa Fe International had merged on the dates assumed
in the pro forma financial information, GlobalSantaFe might have performed
differently. You should not rely on the pro forma financial information as an
indication of the financial position or results of operations that GlobalSantaFe
would have achieved had the merger taken place at an earlier date or of the
future results that GlobalSantaFe will achieve after the merger.

     The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business combination in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
As the stockholders of Global Marine will own slightly over 50% of GlobalSantaFe
after the merger, Global Marine will be considered the acquiring entity for
financial accounting purposes. Accordingly, the historical basis of Global
Marine in its assets and liabilities will be carried forward to the financial
statements of GlobalSantaFe. The assets and liabilities of Santa Fe
International will be revalued to estimated fair value at the date of the merger
in the financial statements of GlobalSantaFe, with the excess of the purchase
price over the sum of such fair values recorded as goodwill. The $2.6 billion
purchase price is calculated using the estimated number of Santa Fe
International ordinary shares expected to be outstanding immediately prior to
the merger and a $14.67 per share average trading price of Global Marine common
stock, as adjusted for the merger ratio ($22.06 per share, as adjusted), for a
period of time immediately before and after the merger was announced, plus the
estimated fair value of Santa Fe International's outstanding stock options.

TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES

     Global Marine estimates that it will incur fees and expenses totaling
approximately $15 million in connection with the merger. Santa Fe International
estimates that it will incur fees and expenses totaling approximately $26
million in connection with the merger, including $10 million payable to Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation. All of such costs have been reflected in the accompanying
unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet. After the merger, GlobalSantaFe will
incur certain additional charges and expenses relating to restructuring and
integrating the operations of Global Marine and Santa Fe International. The pro
forma financial information has not been adjusted for these additional charges
and expenses or for the estimated general and administrative or other cost
savings that may be realized as a result of the merger.

    NOTES TO GLOBALSANTAFE UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL
                                   STATEMENTS

(1)  A summary of the pro forma balance sheet adjustments to effect the merger
is as follows:

     (a) Other current assets -- A reconciliation of the pro forma adjustments
         to other current assets is as follows:

Adjustment to conform accounting policies for materials and
  supplies..................................................  $(43.7)
Fair value adjustment of deferred mobilization costs........    (3.8)
                                                              ------
          Total pro forma adjustment to other current
            assets..........................................  $(47.5)
                                                              ======

     (b) Property and equipment, net -- Represents the adjustment needed to
         record Santa Fe International's property and equipment at estimated
         fair value at the date of the merger.

     (c) Goodwill -- The merger will be accounted for as a purchase business
         combination in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
         in the United States. As the stockholders of Global Marine will own
         slightly over 50% of GlobalSantaFe after the merger, Global Marine will
         be considered the acquiring entity for financial accounting purposes.
         Accordingly, the historical basis of Global Marine in its assets and
         liabilities will be carried forward to the financial statements of
         GlobalSantaFe. The assets and liabilities of Santa Fe International
         will be revalued to estimated fair value at the date of the merger in
         the financial statements of GlobalSantaFe, with the excess of the
         purchase price over the sum of such fair values recorded as goodwill.
         The $2.6 billion purchase price is calculated using the estimated
         number of Santa Fe International ordinary shares expected to be
         outstanding immediately prior to the merger and a $14.67 per share
         average trading price of Global Marine common stock, as adjusted for
         the merger ratio ($22.06 per share, as adjusted), for a period of time
         immediately before and after the merger was announced, plus the
         estimated fair value of Santa Fe International's outstanding stock
         options. The calculated purchase price is for accounting purposes only
         and is not indicative of the price at which Santa Fe International
         ordinary shares will trade immediately before the completion of the
         merger or the value of the GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares to be received
         by Global Marine stockholders in the merger. The recording of goodwill
         is supported by the nature of the offshore drilling industry, the
         acquisition of long-lived drilling equipment, and the long-standing
         relationships among Santa Fe International and its core customers.

     (d) Other assets -- A reconciliation of the pro forma adjustments to other
         assets is as follows:

Fair value adjustment of prepaid pension benefits...........  $14.7
Fair value adjustment of deferred mobilization costs........   (7.7)
                                                              -----
          Total pro forma adjustment to other assets........  $ 7.0

     (e) Current liabilities -- A reconciliation of the pro forma adjustments to
         current liabilities is as follows:

Fees payable associated with the merger.....................  $31.0
Exit costs and employee liabilities incurred................   22.6
Payment to Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.....................   10.0
                                                              -----
          Total pro forma adjustment to current
            liabilities.....................................  $63.6
                                                              =====

     (f) Long-term obligations -- Represents the fair value adjustment of
         accrued pension and postretirement benefits.

     (g) Deferred taxes and other credits -- A reconciliation of the pro forma
         adjustments to deferred taxes and other credits is as follows:

Fair value adjustment of deferred income taxes..............  $36.4
Fair value adjustment of deferred revenues in connection
  with long-term drilling contracts.........................   23.6
                                                              -----
          Total pro forma adjustment to deferred taxes and
            other credits...................................  $60.0
                                                              =====

     (h) Shareholders' equity -- Represents the difference between the purchase
         price (see Note (1c)) and the book value of the net assets of Santa Fe
         International at the pro forma balance sheet date.

     The purchase price will be allocated based on the estimated fair values of
Santa Fe International's assets and liabilities. For purposes of the unaudited
condensed pro forma combined financial statements, the purchase price has been
allocated as follows:

Historical net book value of Santa Fe International.........  $1,566.8
Adjustment to conform accounting policies for materials and
  supplies..................................................     (43.7)
Fair value adjustment of property and equipment, net........     745.2
Fair value adjustment of pension and postretirement benefit
  assets and liabilities....................................      12.8

(2)  A summary of the pro forma statement of operations adjustments to effect
     the merger is as follows:

     (a) Operating revenues -- Represents the amortization of the net deferred
         credit resulting from the fair value adjustment to Santa Fe
         International's long-term drilling contracts.

     (b) Operating expenses -- Represents the elimination of deferred charges
         amortization resulting from the fair value adjustment of Santa Fe
         International's deferred mobilization and compensation costs.

     (c) Depreciation and amortization -- A reconciliation of the pro forma
         adjustments to depreciation and amortization is as follows (Goodwill
         resulting from the merger will not be amortized in accordance with the
         provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
         "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," but instead will be evaluated
         at least annually for impairment):

    debentures, and the estimated dilutive effect of Global Marine employee
    stock options.

                 DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL OF GLOBALSANTAFE

DESCRIPTION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF GLOBALSANTAFE

     The following discussion is a summary of GlobalSantaFe's share capital
immediately after the merger. This summary is not complete and is subject to the
complete text of GlobalSantaFe's memorandum of association and articles of
association, forms of which are attached as Annex F and Annex G, respectively,
to this joint proxy/prospectus. We encourage you to read those documents
carefully.

AUTHORIZED SHARE CAPITAL

     GlobalSantaFe's authorized share capital will be $6,000,000, divided into
600,000,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.01 per share. Upon completion of the
merger, there will be approximately 233,528,000 ordinary shares of GlobalSantaFe
outstanding.

VOTING

     The holders of GlobalSantaFe's ordinary shares will have full voting power
for the election of directors and for all other matters. The holders of ordinary
shares will be entitled to one vote per share. Cumulative voting for the
election of directors will be prohibited by GlobalSantaFe's articles of
association. The amended and restated articles of association of Santa Fe
International provide that all resolutions put to a vote at any general meeting
be decided on a poll (rather than a show of hands of those present or attending
by proxy) taken in such manner as the chairman directs.

     There are no limitations imposed by Cayman Islands law or GlobalSantaFe's
proposed amended and restated articles of association on the right of
nonresident shareholders to hold or vote their GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares.

     The rights attached to any separate class or series of shares, unless
otherwise provided by the terms of the shares of that class or series, may be
varied only with the consent in writing of the holders of all of the issued
shares of that class or series or by a special resolution (as such term is
defined under the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision) of the Cayman Islands as
summarized below) passed at a general meeting with the holders of the shares of
that class or series voting separately as a class. The necessary quorum for that
meeting is the presence of holders of at least a majority of the shares of that
class or series. Each holder of shares of the class or series present, in person
or by proxy, will have one vote for each share of the class or series of which
he is the holder. Outstanding shares will not be deemed to be varied by the
creation or issuance of additional shares that rank pari passu with those
shares.

     Under Cayman Islands law, some matters, like altering the memorandum of
association or articles of association, changing the name of a company or,
subject to the articles of association of a company, the voluntarily winding up
of a company, require the approval of the shareholders by a special resolution.
Also, under the articles of association of GlobalSantaFe, some matters, like
resolving to be registered by way of continuation in a jurisdiction outside the
Cayman Islands, require the approval of the shareholders by a special
resolution. For purposes of the articles of association of GlobalSantaFe, a
resolution is a special resolution when it has been passed by holders of
two-thirds of the ordinary shares, being entitled to do so, vote in person or,
where proxies are allowed, by proxy at a general meeting of which notice
specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has
been duly given.

QUORUM FOR GENERAL MEETINGS

     The presence at a shareholder meeting of one or more shareholders present
in person or by proxy holding at least a majority of the ordinary shares in
issue will constitute a quorum and permit the conduct of shareholder business.
If a meeting is adjourned for lack of a quorum, it will stand adjourned until
the directors determine the day, time and place of the reconvened meeting.
Shareholders holding at least 35% of the outstanding voting shares of
GlobalSantaFe may call extraordinary general meetings of shareholders. For so
long as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation or its affiliates own at least 4% of the
outstanding voting shares or 4% of

the outstanding voting power, the quorum for any meeting at which a special
resolution relating to the rights of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation or its
affiliates in the amended and restated articles of association is to be
considered and voted upon, shall be one or more shareholders present in person
or by proxy holding at least a majority of the outstanding GlobalSantaFe
ordinary shares entitled to vote at such meeting and must include SFIC Holdings.

DIVIDEND RIGHTS

     Subject to any rights and restrictions of any other class or series of
shares, the board of directors may, from time to time, declare dividends on the
shares issued and authorize payment of the dividends out of GlobalSantaFe's
profits, retained earnings or share premium account, which is equivalent to
additional paid in capital. The board of directors may declare that any dividend
be paid wholly or partly by the distribution of shares of GlobalSantaFe and/or
specific assets.

RIGHTS UPON LIQUIDATION

     Upon the liquidation of GlobalSantaFe, after the full amounts to which
holders of any issued shares ranking senior to the ordinary shares as to
distribution on liquidation or winding-up are entitled to receive have been paid
or set aside for payment, the holders of GlobalSantaFe's ordinary shares are
entitled to receive, pro rata, any remaining assets of GlobalSantaFe available
for distribution to the holders of the ordinary shares. The liquidator may
deduct from the amount payable in respect of those ordinary shares any
liabilities the holder has to GlobalSantaFe. The assets received by the holders
of GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares in a liquidation may consist in whole or in
part of property.

NO LIABILITY FOR FURTHER CALLS OR ASSESSMENTS

     The GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares to be issued in the merger will be duly
and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

NO PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

     Holders of GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares will have no preemptive or
preferential right to purchase any securities of GlobalSantaFe that may be
issued in the future.

REDEMPTION AND CONVERSION

     The GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares are not convertible into shares of any
other class or series or subject to redemption by GlobalSantaFe or the holder of
the shares.

REPURCHASE

     Under GlobalSantaFe's proposed articles of association, GlobalSantaFe may
purchase any issued ordinary shares by entering into an agreement with any one
or more of its shareholders, tender offer to all of its shareholders, or
purchase on any exchange or market on which the ordinary shares are traded. In
each case, unless approved by ordinary resolution, the purchase price may not be
greater than the market price determined by the board of directors by reference
to the closing prices on the principal exchange or market for the ordinary
shares for a period of not less than one and not more than ten consecutive
trading days ending not more than three trading days before such determination.
An ordinary resolution is a resolution passed by a simple majority of the votes
cast by shareholders entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy at a
general meeting.

OTHER CLASSES OR SERIES OF SHARES

     The GlobalSantaFe board of directors will be authorized, without obtaining
any votes or consents of the holders of any class or series of shares, to
provide from time to time for the issuance of other classes or series of shares
and to establish the characteristics of each class or series, including the
number of shares,

designations, relative voting rights, dividend rights, liquidation and other
rights, redemption, repurchase or exchange rights and any other preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other rights and limitations not
inconsistent with applicable law.

COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF SHARES HELD BY MINORITY HOLDERS

     An acquiring party is generally able to acquire compulsorily the ordinary
shares of minority holders in one of two ways:

     - By a procedure under the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision) of the
       Cayman Islands known as a "scheme of arrangement." A scheme of
       arrangement is made by obtaining the approval of the arrangement by
       holders of ordinary shares (1) representing a majority in number of the
       shareholders present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting held to
       consider the arrangement, excluding the acquiring party, if such party is
       a shareholder and (2) holding at least 75% in value of all the
       outstanding ordinary shares held by shareholders present, in person or by
       proxy, at such meeting, other than those held by the acquiring party, if
       any, and the sanction of the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. If a
       scheme of arrangement becomes effective, all holders of ordinary shares
       of the company would be compelled to sell their shares under the terms of
       the scheme of arrangement.

     - By acquiring pursuant to a tender offer 90% of the ordinary shares not
       already owned by the acquiring party. If the acquiring party has, within
       four months after the making of an offer for all the ordinary shares not
       owned by the acquiring party, obtained the approval of not less than 90%
       of all the shares to which the offer relates, the acquiring party may, at
       any time within two months after the end of that four-month period,
       require any nontendering shareholder to transfer its shares on the same
       terms as the original offer. In those circumstances, a nontendering
       shareholder will be compelled to sell its shares, unless within one month
       from the date on which the notice to compulsorily acquire was given to
       the nontendering shareholder, the nontendering shareholder is able to
       convince the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands to order otherwise.

LIMITATION ON DIRECTOR'S LIABILITY

     Cayman Islands law, which will govern GlobalSantaFe, does not allow the
limitation of a director's liability for fraud, willful neglect or willful
default.

LIMITATION ON CHANGES IN CONTROL

     GlobalSantaFe's proposed articles of association have provisions that could
have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions are intended to enhance the
likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of
directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors, and may have
the effect of discouraging actual or threatened changes of control.

     The proposed articles of association provide that GlobalSantaFe's board of
directors will be divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.
Directors can be removed from office only for cause by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the issued shares generally entitled to vote. The
board of directors will not have the power to remove directors. Vacancies on the
board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors and not by the
shareholders. Each of these provisions can delay a shareholder from obtaining
majority representation on the board of directors.

     The proposed articles of association provide that the board of directors
will consist of at least six and not more than fifteen persons, the exact number
to be set from time to time by a majority of the whole board of directors.
Following the merger, there will be 14 directors of GlobalSantaFe. Accordingly,
the board of directors, and not the shareholders, will have the authority to
determine the number of directors and could delay any shareholder from obtaining
majority representation on the board of directors by enlarging the board of
directors and filling the new vacancies with its own nominees until a general
meeting at which directors are to be appointed.

     The proposed articles of association provide that, until the third
anniversary of the completion of the merger, a vote of two-thirds of the whole
board of GlobalSantaFe is required (i) to remove the chairman of the board, the
chief executive officer or the president or (ii) to modify, amend or terminate
the employment agreements of Robert E. Rose or C. Stedman Garber, Jr.

     The proposed articles of association establish an advance notice procedure
that must be followed by shareholders if they wish to nominate candidates for
election as directors or propose any business at an annual general meeting of
shareholders. The proposed articles of association provide generally that, if a
shareholder desires to nominate candidates for election as directors or propose
any business at an annual general meeting, that shareholder must give
GlobalSantaFe notice not less than 90 days prior to the anniversary of the date
of the immediately preceding annual general meeting. The notice must contain
specified information concerning the shareholder submitting the proposal.

     Subject to the terms of any other class of shares in issue, any action
required or permitted to be taken by the holders of GlobalSantaFe's ordinary
shares must be taken at a duly called annual or extraordinary general meeting of
shareholders and may not be taken by written consent of all holders of ordinary
shares. Extraordinary general meetings may be called by a majority of the entire
board of directors or upon the written request of shareholders holding at least
35% of the issued ordinary shares entitled to vote.

     The board of directors will be authorized, without obtaining any vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of shares, to issue from time to
time any other classes or series of shares with the designations and relative
powers, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends or terms or conditions of redemption as it considers
fit. The board of directors could authorize the issuance of preference shares
with terms and conditions that could discourage a takeover or other transaction
that holders of some or a majority of the ordinary shares might believe to be in
their best interests or in which holders might receive a premium for their
shares over the then market price of the shares. No preference shares have been
established as of the date of this document.

     In addition to any approval by shareholders and directors of GlobalSantaFe
under Cayman Islands law, the approval by ordinary resolution at an
extraordinary general meeting called for such purpose is required in order for
the board of directors to approve any of the following matters:

     - to merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company;

     - to reorganize or reconstruct itself pursuant to a plan sanctioned by the
       Cayman Islands courts; or

     - to sell, lease or exchange all or substantially all of the assets of
       GlobalSantaFe.

RIGHTS OF KUWAIT PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES

     The proposed articles of association provide that, for so long as Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates own at least 12.5% of the outstanding
shares or at least 12.5% of the outstanding voting shares, SFIC Holdings will
have the right to designate for election three directors of GlobalSantaFe. If
SFIC Holdings' interest is reduced to less than 12.5% and equal to or greater
than 7.5%, the number of directors that SFIC Holdings will have the right to
designate for election will be reduced from three to two. If SFIC Holdings'
interest is reduced to less than 7.5% and equal to or greater than 4%, the
number of directors that SFIC Holdings may designate for election will be
reduced from two to one. If SFIC Holdings' interest is reduced to less than 4%,
it will not have the right to designate any directors for election to the board
of GlobalSantaFe. For purposes of determining SFIC Holdings' ownership interest
in GlobalSantaFe, until SFIC Holdings sells any GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares,
only ordinary shares outstanding at the effective time of the merger are
included in the calculation of the ownership percentage so that reductions in
SFIC Holdings' percentage ownership in GlobalSantaFe as a result of
GlobalSantaFe's issuance of shares for any reason following the merger will not
reduce SFIC Holdings' board representation.

     The proposed articles of association provide that, as long as SFIC Holdings
has the right to designate a director to the GlobalSantaFe board as described
above, SFIC Holdings will have the right to designate one designee to each
committee, including the audit, nominating and governance, compensation and
executive committee of the board of directors of GlobalSantaFe.

     The proposed articles of association provide that during the period of time
commencing at the effective time of the merger and terminating upon the later of
the date on which Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and its affiliates shall cease to
own, in the aggregate, at least 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Santa
Fe International or 10% of the outstanding voting shares of Santa Fe
International, the prior consent of SFIC Holdings will generally be required to
change the jurisdiction of any existing subsidiary of GlobalSantaFe or
incorporate a new subsidiary in any jurisdiction in a manner materially
adversely affecting the rights or interests of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and
its affiliates or reincorporate GlobalSantaFe in another jurisdiction.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     The transfer agent and registrar for GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares will be
Computershare Investor Services, LLC.

STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

     GlobalSantaFe ordinary shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "GSF."

                      COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

     In connection with the merger, the memorandum of association and articles
of association of Santa Fe International will be amended and its name will be
changed to "GlobalSantaFe Corporation." As a result of the merger, holders of
shares of Global Marine common stock will become shareholders of Santa Fe
International. The rights of Global Marine's stockholders are governed by the
Delaware General Corporation Law and Global Marine's certificate of
incorporation and by-laws. The rights of Santa Fe International's shareholders
are governed by Cayman Islands law, including the Companies Law (2001 Second
Revision) of the Cayman Islands, and Santa Fe International's memorandum of
association and articles of association. The rights of shareholders of
GlobalSantaFe will be governed by Cayman Islands law, including the Companies
Law (2001 Second Revision) of the Cayman Islands, and GlobalSantaFe's memorandum
of association and articles of association.

     This section describes the material differences between the rights of
Global Marine's stockholders, the rights of Santa Fe International's
shareholders and the proposed rights of GlobalSantaFe's shareholders. This
summary is not complete and does not cover all of the differences between Cayman
Islands law and the Delaware General Corporation Law affecting corporations and
their shareholders or all the differences between Global Marine's certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, Santa Fe International's memorandum of association
and articles of association and GlobalSantaFe's proposed memorandum of
association and articles of association. The summary is therefore subject to the
complete text of the relevant provisions of the Companies Law (2001 Second
Revision) of the Cayman Islands, the Delaware General Corporation Law, Global
Marine's certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Santa Fe International's
memorandum of association and articles of association and GlobalSantaFe's
memorandum of association and articles of association. For information on
obtaining Santa Fe International's memorandum of association and articles of
association and Global Marine's certificate of incorporation and by-laws, see
"Where You Can Find More Information" on page 125. The forms of the memorandum
of association and articles of association of GlobalSantaFe are set forth as
Annex F and Annex G, respectively, to this joint proxy/prospectus.

exceptions are satisfied.
Because Global Marine is
subject to this law, an

period
after it becomes an
interested stockholder,
unless:
- the business combination,
  or the transaction that
  resulted in the interested

  Marine board of directors
  before the other party to
  the business combination
  became an interested

- upon consummation of the
  transaction that resulted
  in the interested
  stockholder becoming an
  interested stockholder, the
  interested stockholder
  owned at least 85% of the
  voting shares of Global
  Marine outstanding at the
  commencement of the
  transaction (excluding
  voting shares owned by
  directors who are also
  officers or held in em-
  ployee stock plans in which
  the employees do not have a
  right to determine

  plan); or
- the business combination
  was approved by the Global
  Marine board of directors
  and ratified by 66 2/3% of
  the voting shares that the
  interested stockholder did
  not own.
The three-year probation does
not apply to certain business
