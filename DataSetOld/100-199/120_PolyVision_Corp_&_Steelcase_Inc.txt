                                                     _________ ___, 2001

Dear PolyVision Shareholder:

         You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of shareholders
of PolyVision Corporation to be held on ____________ __, 2001, at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time, at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, The MetLife Building,
200 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10166.

         At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a
proposal to adopt an agreement and plan of merger among PolyVision, Steelcase
Inc. and PV Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steelcase. If the
merger is completed, PolyVision will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Steelcase, and you will receive $2.25 in cash, without interest, for each share
of PolyVision common stock that you own. Since your shares will be exchanged
for cash in the merger, when the merger is completed you no longer will own an
equity interest in PolyVision or be able to share in its potential future
earnings or growth.

         Before we can complete the merger, the holders of at least 66-2/3% of
the outstanding shares of our common stock, series B preferred stock and series
C preferred stock, voting together as a single class, and at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of our series B and series C preferred stock, voting as
separate classes, must vote to adopt the merger agreement.

         The Alpine Group, Inc., our principal shareholder, owns approximately
48.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and all of the outstanding
shares of our series B and series C preferred stock, and has agreed with
Steelcase to vote all of its shares to adopt the merger agreement. If the merger
agreement is adopted and all other conditions described in the merger agreement
are met, the merger will occur as soon as possible after the special meeting.

         A special committee of three independent directors was formed by your
board to analyze, consider and negotiate the terms of the merger and make a
recommendation to the full board of directors. In doing so, the special
committee consulted with our management team and with outside financial and
legal advisors and considered a number of factors, which are detailed in the
accompanying proxy statement. The special committee received the written opinion
of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc. that, as of August 23, 2001, the $2.25 per
share merger consideration to be received by holders of our common stock is fair
from a financial point of view to those holders, other than Alpine. A copy of
Deutsche Banc's fairness opinion is included as Appendix C to this proxy
statement.

         Your board of directors, upon the recommendation of the special
committee of independent directors, has determined that the merger is advisable,
fair to you and in your best interests. Accordingly, your board of directors has
unanimously approved the merger and adopted the merger agreement and recommends
that you vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

         To adopt the merger agreement, you must cast a "FOR" vote by following
the instructions stated in the enclosed proxy card. If you do not vote at all,
your non-vote will count as a vote against adoption of the merger agreement.
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please take the time to vote by
completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card. If you sign, date and mail your
proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted for
adoption of the merger agreement. If you fail to return your proxy card, you
will not be counted as present or voting at the meeting unless you appear in
person. If you attend the special meeting, you may revoke your proxy if you wish
and vote personally.

         The accompanying proxy statement provides detailed information about
the proposed merger. We encourage you to read the entire proxy statement,
including the appendices, carefully.

         Sincerely,

         STEVEN S. ELBAUM                  MICHAEL H. DUNN
         Chairman of the Board             President and Chief Executive Officer

         The date of this proxy statement is _________ ___, 2001 and it is first

                       TO BE HELD ON ___________ ___, 2001

                  Steelcase, and PolyVision. The merger agreement provides that
                  PV Acquisition will merge with and into PolyVision, with
                  PolyVision surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary
                  of Steelcase. In the merger, each outstanding share of
                  PolyVision common stock will be automatically converted into
                  the right to receive $2.25 in cash, without interest.

         o        To consider and act on any other matters that may properly
                  come before the special meeting or any adjournment or
                  postponement of the special meeting.

         Before we can complete the merger, the holders of at least 66-2/3% of
the outstanding shares of our common stock, series B preferred stock and series
C preferred stock, voting together as a single class, and at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of our series B and series C preferred stock, voting as

Inc., our principal shareholder, owns approximately 48.1% of the outstanding
shares of our common stock and all of the outstanding shares of our series B and

committee of independent directors, has determined that the merger is advisable,
fair to you and in your best interests. Accordingly, your board of directors has
unanimously approved the merger and adopted the merger agreement and recommends
that you vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

         These items of business are described in detail in the attached proxy
statement and in the appendices to the attached proxy statement. You are
encouraged to read these materials very carefully and in their entirety before
deciding how to vote.

         We have fixed the close of business on ____________ __, 2001 as the
record date for determining who is entitled to vote at the special meeting and
any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. A list of shareholders
entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available and open to the
examination of any shareholder at the special meeting.

                               THE SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Time and Place

         The enclosed proxy is solicited by and on behalf of your board of
directors for use at the special meeting of PolyVision shareholders scheduled
for _______ __, 2001, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of Greenberg
Traurig, LLP, The MetLife Building, 200 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New
York 10166.

         This proxy statement and the accompanying form of proxy were first
mailed to you on or about ______ __, 2001.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

         At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on:

         o    a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
              August 24, 2001, by and among Steelcase, PV Acquisition and
              PolyVision; and

         o    any other matters that may properly come before the special
              meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting.

         A special committee of three independent directors was formed by your
board to analyze, consider and negotiate the terms of the merger and make a
recommendation to the full board of directors. In doing so, the special
committee consulted with our management team and with outside financial and
legal advisors and considered a number of factors. After extensive consideration
of these factors, the special committee concluded that the merger is advisable,
fair to you and in your best interests, and unanimously recommended to your full
board of directors that it vote to approve the merger, adopt the merger
agreement and recommend to you that you vote to adopt the merger agreement.

         Your board of directors, upon the recommendation of the special
committee of independent directors, has determined that the merger is advisable,
fair to you and in your best interests. Accordingly, your board of directors has
unanimously approved the merger and adopted the merger agreement and recommends
that you vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

Record Date; Outstanding Shares and Voting

         Your board of directors has fixed the close of business on _________,
2001 as the record date for purposes of determining the shareholders entitled to
vote at the special meeting. Only those shareholders as of the record date are
entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the
record date, there were 14,168,527 shares of our common stock, 255,000 shares of
our series B preferred stock and 140,000 shares of our series C preferred stock
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Holders of
these shares are entitled to cast one vote per share on the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement. At the special meeting, our common stock, series B
preferred stock and series C preferred stock will vote together as a single
class, and our series B preferred stock and series C preferred stock will vote
as separate classes on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. There are no
other outstanding classes or series of PolyVision securities entitled to vote at
the special meeting.

Vote Required

         The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of
the shares of PolyVision common stock, series B preferred stock and series C
preferred stock outstanding on the record date for the special meeting is
necessary to constitute a quorum for the special meeting. A quorum is necessary
for the special meeting to be valid. If a quorum should not be present, the
special meeting may be adjourned from time to time until a quorum is obtained.
For the merger to be completed, the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock, series B preferred stock and series C
preferred stock, voting together as a single class, must vote to adopt the
merger agreement. In addition, at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
series B preferred stock, voting as a separate class, and a majority of the
outstanding shares of series C preferred stock, voting as a separate class, must
vote to adopt the merger agreement.

         At the special meeting, abstentions and votes withheld will be treated
as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum. If a broker does not receive voting instructions from the
beneficial

owner of shares on a particular matter and indicates on the proxy that it does
not have discretionary authority to vote on that matter, known as a
"broker non-vote," those shares will be considered as present and entitled to
vote with respect to that matter for the purposes of establishing a quorum.
Because the affirmative vote of not less than 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares
entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to adopt the merger
agreement, abstentions, votes withheld and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as votes against adoption of the merger agreement.

Share Ownership of Alpine and Management

         On the record date, Alpine, our principal shareholder, owned:

         o    6,820,113 shares of our common stock, representing 48.1% of the
              outstanding shares of our common stock;

         o    255,000 shares of our series B preferred stock, representing all
              of the outstanding shares of our series B preferred stock; and

         o    140,000 shares of our series C preferred stock, representing all
              of the outstanding shares of our series C preferred stock.

         Under the terms of the shareholder's agreement among Alpine, Steelcase
and PV Acquisition, a copy of which is included as Appendix B to this proxy
statement, Alpine has agreed, among other things, to vote all of its PolyVision
shares to adopt the merger agreement. Alpine's shares represent 49.5% of the
aggregate number of shares of our common stock, series B preferred stock and
series C preferred stock entitled to vote together as a single class at the
special meeting, and all of the preferred stock that will vote as separate
classes at the special meeting.

         In addition, on September 10, 2001, PolyVision's directors and
executive officers and their affiliates, excluding Alpine, held an aggregate of
770,774 shares of our common stock, or approximately 5.4% of the outstanding
shares of our common stock. We expect these individuals to vote to adopt of the
merger agreement. Accordingly, after counting Alpine and our management, if the
holders of an additional 1,722,160 shares of our common stock, representing
approximately 12.2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, also vote to
adopt the merger agreement, the merger agreement will be adopted.

Solicitation and Voting of Proxies

         Shares of our common stock represented by duly executed proxies in the
enclosed form received prior to the special meeting and not revoked will be
voted at the meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting, in accordance with the instructions specified on the proxy. If no
instructions are specified, it is the intention of the duly elected proxies to
vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

         Your board of directors is not aware of any other matters which may be
presented for consideration and a vote at the special meeting. If other matters
do properly come before the special meeting, it is intended that shares of our
common stock represented by duly executed proxies in the enclosed form will be
voted by the persons named in the proxy in accordance with their best judgment.
Any proxy voted against adoption of the merger agreement will not be voted in
favor of any motion to adjourn the special meeting in order to solicit
additional proxies.

         PolyVision will pay all of the expenses of soliciting proxies for the
special meeting, including the cost of preparing, printing, assembling and
mailing this proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy. In addition to the
solicitation of proxies by mail, officers and regular employees of PolyVision,
without additional compensation, may use their personal efforts, by telephone or
otherwise, to obtain proxies. PolyVision also will request persons, firms and
corporations holding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees,
which shares are beneficially owned by others, to send this proxy statement to
and obtain proxies from such beneficial owners, and will reimburse such holders
for their reasonable expenses in so doing.

         In addition, PolyVision has retained D.F. King & Co. Inc. to
assist in the solicitation of proxies. D.F. King will receive reasonable and
customary compensation for its services, estimated at $6,500, will be reimbursed
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified against most
liabilities and expenses in connection with its services, including liabilities
under the federal securities laws.

Revocation of Proxies

         You may revoke a proxy that you have given at any time before it is
voted by:

         o    giving written notice to the secretary of PolyVision stating that
              you would like to revoke your proxy;

         o    delivering a new executed proxy bearing a later date according to
              the solicitation requirements set forth above; or

         o    attending the special meeting and voting in person.

         All written notices of revocation and other communications with respect
to revocation of proxies should be addressed to PolyVision as follows: Mr. Gary
L. Edwards, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, PolyVision
Corporation, 4888 South Old Peachtree Road, Norcross, Georgia 30071. Attendance
at the special meeting will not have the effect of revoking a proxy unless the
PolyVision shareholder in attendance notifies the secretary of the meeting in
writing of the revocation before the shares subject to the proxy are voted.

                                   THE PARTIES

PolyVision Corporation

         PolyVision is an international manufacturer and installer of static,
active and interactive visual communication products for the education and
corporate markets and is the leading supplier of light-gauge ceramicsteel,
critical in the manufacture of quality writing and projection surfaces.

                                   THE MERGER

         This section describes aspects of the proposed merger we consider
important, including the merger agreement which is attached as Appendix A to
this proxy statement and incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.
While we believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger,
the summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. You
should read this entire proxy statement and the other documents we refer to
carefully and in their entirety for a complete understanding of the merger.

Background of the Merger

         During the summer of 2000, in connection with the proposed acquisition
by PolyVision of the interactive computer conferencing and group communications
business of Microfield Graphics, Inc., representatives of PolyVision were
introduced to representatives of Steelcase, which was then a significant
shareholder of Microfield Graphics. In the course of negotiations concerning the
Microfield Graphics transaction, PolyVision and Steelcase discovered a mutual
interest in working cooperatively to develop interactive visual communications
products. To facilitate their exchange of information, PolyVision and Steelcase
signed a mutual confidentiality agreement on August 8, 2000.

         The parties were unable to reach agreement on a collaboration and, in
October 2000, Steelcase indicated, on a preliminary basis, that it might instead
consider acquiring PolyVision. The parties were unable to reach an agreement in
principle on price and other material transaction terms, and discussions
terminated in mid-November 2000.

         In March 2001, PolyVision and Steelcase reinitiated discussions
concerning collaboration in the interactive visual communications field. In late
April 2001, Steelcase expressed its interest in acquiring PolyVision. Further
meetings were held in May 2001 regarding a possible acquisition. On July 6,
2001, Michael H. Dunn, PolyVision's president and chief executive officer, and
Steven S. Elbaum, PolyVision's chairman, met with Terrence J. Lenhardt,
Steelcase's vice president of corporate strategy and development, and Michael I.
Love, president and chief executive officer of the Steelcase Design Partnership.
Messrs. Lenhardt and Love indicated that Steelcase would be prepared to pursue
an acquisition of PolyVision at an aggregate purchase price of between $172.5
million and $177.5 million, including estimated transaction costs and
PolyVision's outstanding indebtedness at the time of closing. Messrs. Lenhardt
and Love stated that Steelcase's interest in pursuing an acquisition of
PolyVision was conditioned on support of the transaction by Alpine, including
its agreement to vote in favor of the acquisition and its grant to
Steelcase of an option to acquire all of the PolyVision shares held by Alpine;
the retention of a number of executive officers of PolyVision under new
employment agreement terms that would take effect upon consummation of the
merger and, in the case of Mr. Dunn, would replace his existing severance
arrangement; and the ability to proceed with negotiations with both
PolyVision and Alpine on an exclusive basis. After further discussion, Messrs.
Elbaum and Dunn stated that PolyVision would consider an offer based on a
company valuation of $180.0 million in cash, all inclusive.

      During the ensuing week, Steelcase's outside legal counsel, Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), discussed with representatives of PolyVision
and Alpine the conditions on which Steelcase would be willing to pursue an
acquisition. Skadden Arps explained that Steelcase's proposal assumed that both
an acquisition agreement and a shareholder's agreement in which Alpine granted
to Steelcase an option to acquire its PolyVision shares would be approved by
PolyVision's board of directors to avoid the restrictions under New York's
business combination statute.

         On July 17, 2001, PolyVision and Alpine entered into a 45-day
exclusivity agreement with Steelcase providing, among other things, that neither
of them would initiate, negotiate or entertain any proposal for the acquisition
of PolyVision by a third party.

         On July 19, 2001, to establish the basis for further discussions and
negotiations, Steelcase submitted to PolyVision's board of directors a letter
containing a non-binding preliminary indication of interest in pursuing an
acquisition of PolyVision at a total valuation of 180.0 million, including
PolyVision's indebtedness, related transaction costs and expenses associated
with the retention of management. As previously discussed by the parties,
as part of such proposal, Steelcase would require Alpine's voting support,
as well as an option to purchase Alpine's shares of PolyVision. Steelcase
commenced its due diligence review of PolyVision shortly afterwards. PolyVision
established data

rooms at its offices in Norcross, Georgia and Genk, Belgium to facilitate the
review.

         Since Alpine is a significant shareholder of PolyVision and several
members of PolyVision's board of directors are Alpine affiliates, PolyVision's
board of directors determined to form a special committee of independent
directors to analyze, consider and negotiate a potential business combination
transaction with Steelcase and to make recommendations to the board of directors
relating to any transaction proposal. On August 8, 2001, the board of directors
appointed to the special committee Joseph A. Menniti, Lyman C. Hamilton, Jr. and
Hansel B. (Hank) Millican, Jr., none of whom is an officer of PolyVision or an
officer or director of Alpine, and none of whom has any significant ownership or
other interest in Alpine. Later that day, initial drafts of the merger agreement
and the shareholder's agreement were delivered to the special committee and
Alpine.

         The special committee held its first meeting on August 13, 2001 and
appointed Mr. Menniti as its chairman and formally engaged Greenberg Traurig
as its counsel. The special committee also discussed candidates to serve as its
financial advisor. The special committee then discussed the initial drafts of
the merger agreement and the shareholder's agreement, focusing on the call
option to be granted to Steelcase by Alpine under the proposed shareholder's
agreement. As originally proposed, the option would enable Steelcase to acquire
a significant ownership interest in PolyVision and engage in a subsequent
merger or other corporate-level transaction involving PolyVision's minority
shareholders on terms and conditions not necessarily subject to the special
committee's review and approval. The special committee also discussed the
ability of the board of directors to become fully informed about unsolicited
transaction proposals from third parties, the circumstances under which
Steelcase would be entitled to terminate the merger agreement, the proposed
termination fee and the circumstances under which a termination fee would be
payable by PolyVision.

         On August 15, 2001, the special committee engaged Deutsche Banc as its
financial advisor. In selecting Deutsche Banc, the special committee considered
its familiarity with PolyVision, its ability to staff the engagement promptly,
its fee proposal and its qualifications, expertise, reputation and experience in
public company mergers and acquisitions. In November 2000, Alpine, PolyVision's
principal shareholder, had retained Deutsche Banc to identify strategic
alternatives to increase Alpine's shareholder value. As part of this process, in
November 2000, Deutsche Banc conducted due diligence on PolyVision to determine
the value of PolyVision's different business segments. The special committee
concluded that, notwithstanding Deutsche Banc's prior retention by Alpine,
Deutsche Banc was independent. In reaching this conclusion, the special
committee considered, among other things, that Deutsche Banc was currently
providing services to Alpine, although not in respect of this transaction, and
that it had procedures in place to keep information regarding advice to the
special committee confidential. Deutsche Banc commenced its due diligence review
of PolyVision, and Mr. Menniti met with Gary L. Edwards, PolyVision's chief
financial officer, to conduct a detailed review of PolyVision's financial
condition and prospects.

         The special committee met again on August 16, 2001. Mr. Menniti
reported to the special committee on the results of his meeting with Mr. Edwards
and his review of PolyVision's financial condition and prospects. The special
committee then considered strategic alternatives to the proposed transaction
with Steelcase as a means of maximizing shareholder value, including:

         o    divestiture of particular operations instead of the whole of
              PolyVision to reduce indebtedness and increase financial
              flexibility;

         o    seeking an alternative financial acquirer, strategic purchaser or
              business combination partner; and

         o    seeking to refinance PolyVision's indebtedness at a lower rate of
              interest.

         Regarding these alternatives, the special committee believed that it
was extremely unlikely that strategic acquirers would be willing to acquire the
operations that PolyVision would consider divesting. PolyVision is one of the
largest manufacturers of ceramicsteel for the kindergarten through 12th grade
market and it would be extremely unlikely that any company other than Steelcase
could acquire PolyVision's ceramicsteel or other operations and achieve
economies of scale and cost synergies on a reasonable near-term basis. For
similar reasons, an acquisition of PolyVision as a whole by a strategic acquirer
other than Steelcase in a superior transaction was believed to be unlikely. The
special committee doubted that any financial acquirers would surface. The
current sluggish state of the U.S. capital markets and overall U.S. economy was
also considered. It was also believed unlikely that a new lending group would be
able to refinance PolyVision's debt at materially lower interest rates or more
favorable cash coverage ratios to provide for greater financial flexibility.

         Also discussed at the August 16, 2001 meeting was Steelcase's proposed
offer of approximately $180.0 million, which represented approximately $2.25 to
$2.27 net per share of common stock in cash after taking into account estimated
transaction costs, the retirement or assumption of PolyVision's indebtedness at
closing, the cash-out of in-the-money stock options and warrants and the payment
of cash settlements to the holders of PolyVision's outstanding preferred stock.
Given the special committee's views as to the impracticality of implementing a
comprehensive financial restructuring or an alternate strategy to maximize
shareholder value, the special committee believed that a transaction at the
price proposed by Steelcase would provide substantial value to PolyVision's
minority shareholders that was unlikely to be obtained in any alternative
transaction or achieved on a long-term basis if PolyVision remained independent.
The committee members agreed to review further the financial aspects of
Steelcase's proposal in consultation with Deutsche Banc. Because Steelcase was
unwilling to proceed without approval by PolyVision's board of directors of the
shareholder's agreement, including the option to acquire Alpine's PolyVision
shares, the special committee directed Greenberg Traurig to continue negotiation
of the merger agreement and to seek to protect minority shareholders if the
option in the shareholder's agreement were ever exercised.

         Negotiations on August 16 and 17, 2001 yielded an agreement in
principle that Steelcase's option to acquire Alpine's PolyVision shares would be
exercisable only in the event of termination of the merger agreement, and that,
if the option were exercised, Steelcase would thereafter be obligated to
commence an all-cash tender offer for all outstanding PolyVision shares for the
same consideration as otherwise would have been paid in the merger, followed
promptly by a second-step merger transaction at this same price for remaining
PolyVision shares and in-the-money employee options. Over the course of the next
 several days, the special committee and Greenberg Traurig negotiated a reduced
termination fee, narrowed the circumstances in which such a fee would become
payable to Steelcase and modified the circumstances in which Steelcase could
terminate the merger agreement and the conditions under which Steelcase could
decline to consummate the merger.

         The special committee met again on August 17, 2001 to review the status
of negotiations on the merger and shareholder's agreements and to receive an
update from representatives of Deutsche Banc concerning the status of its
financial review of PolyVision.

         At a meeting held on August 17, 2001, Steelcase's board of directors
reviewed the proposed acquisition of PolyVision and the terms of the merger
agreement and shareholder's agreement as negotiated to date. The Steelcase board
approved the transaction and authorized officers of the company to proceed with
negotiations to finalize the transaction documents, subject to the satisfactory
completion of due diligence and receipt from PolyVision, and review of, a
completed disclosure schedule to the merger agreement.

         During the third week of August 2001, the parties continued to
negotiate the details of the merger agreement and the shareholder's agreement.
Steelcase informed PolyVision, Greenberg Traurig and counsel to Alpine that the
Steelcase board had authorized finalization of the proposed transactions, but
that no agreement could be achieved without resolution of all open due diligence
items and final agreement as to the contents of PolyVision's disclosure
schedule.

         The special committee met on August 22, 2001. Greenberg Traurig
reported on the status of negotiations and reviewed the duties of the special
committee with respect to its assessment of the merger and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and shareholder's agreement.
Representatives of Deutsche Banc presented to the special committee their firm's
financial analyses of the merger and the methodologies used in their analyses.
Deutsche Banc then delivered to the special committee its oral opinion to the
effect that the consideration of $2.25 per share in cash to be received in the
merger by PolyVision's common shareholders was fair from a financial point of
view to those shareholders, other than Alpine. Deutsche Banc noted that its
opinion would be confirmed in writing to the special committee the following
day. A detailed discussion of the opinion is set forth under "Opinion of Special
Committee Financial Advisor" below.

         Following receipt of the written opinion from Deutsche Banc, the
special committee met again on August 23, 2001. At this meeting, Greenberg
Traurig reviewed in detail the principal terms and conditions of the merger
agreement and the shareholder's agreement. After further deliberations, the
special committee resolved unanimously to recommend to PolyVision's full board
of directors that it approve and adopt the merger agreement and, for purposes of
New York's business combination statute, approve the transactions contemplated
by the shareholder's agreement.

         PolyVision's full board of directors met on the afternoon of August 23,
2001 to receive the recommendation of the special committee concerning the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and
shareholder's agreement. Mr. Menniti, on behalf of the special committee,
summarized for the board the process by which the special committee negotiated
the merger agreement and arrived at its recommendation. Mr. Menniti first
delineated the material terms of the transaction documentation and discussed in
detail the allocation of the merger consideration among PolyVision's creditors
and common and preferred shareholders.

         Mr. Menniti next discussed the special committee's analysis of
PolyVision's financial condition. Mr. Menniti concluded his analysis with a
discussion of Deutsche Banc's presentation on PolyVision's valuation and its
opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to minority
shareholders of the consideration to be paid to PolyVision's common shareholders
in the merger. Copies of this opinion were then made available to the board.
Finally, Mr. Menniti reported on the special committee's unanimous
recommendation that the full PolyVision board of directors approve and adopt the
merger agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by the shareholder's
agreement.

         Following further discussion, the board of directors unanimously
resolved to approve and adopt the merger agreement and to approve the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the shareholder's
agreement.  The board of directors also authorized the execution and delivery

of the merger agreement and other transaction documentation, and the filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission of all appropriate proxy solicitation
materials.

         Commencing after the board meeting, and continuing through August 24,
2001, Greenberg Traurig and Skadden Arps continued to work on completion of the
due diligence review and PolyVision's disclosure schedule, as well as
negotiation of various representations, warranties and covenants in the merger
agreement. Agreements containing the post-merger employment terms for Mr. Dunn
and three other executive officers were executed during the day, and the merger
agreement and shareholder's agreement were executed in the overnight hours, on
Friday, August 24, 2001.

         On Monday, August 27, 2001, prior to the opening of trading on the
American Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange, PolyVision and Steelcase
issued separate press releases announcing the execution of the merger agreement
by PolyVision, Steelcase and PV Acquisition and the execution of the
shareholder's agreement by Alpine, Steelcase and PV Acquisition.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Board of Directors

         A special committee of three independent directors was formed by your
board to analyze, consider and negotiate the terms of the merger and make a
recommendation to the full board of directors. In reaching its conclusions
and making its recommendation to the board of directors, the special committee
and the board of directors consulted with our management team and with outside
financial and legal advisors and considered a number of factors, including the
following principal factors:

         o    general economic, industry and market conditions in industries
              similar to those in which we engage;

         o    the approximately $180.0 million valuation for PolyVision offered
              by Steelecase, and the apparent substantial value to our common
              shareholders to be realized in the merger;

         o    alternative business and financial strategies designed to provide
              us with enough cash to increase profitability and maximize
              shareholder value;

         o    the premium that the $2.25 per common share merger consideration
              represents over recent and historical market prices of our common
              stock;

         o    the special committee's view that the likelihood of an offer for a
              superior alternative acquisition transaction was low in the near
              term;

         o    historical and current information concerning our businesses,
              financial performance and condition, capital structure, leverage
              and competitive position;

         o    the risks which would be encountered in executing our long-term
              business plan;

         o    our strengths and weaknesses as an independent public company,
              which included our reputation, market share and financial
              resources;

         o    the fact that, if the merger is completed, you will no longer
              participate in any potential future growth of PolyVision;

         o    the difficulty in predicting our future stock price performance,
              and the historical limited liquidity of our common stock;

         o    Alpine's expressed intention to vote in favor of the transaction
              with Steelcase on the terms provided for in the merger agreement;

         o    the analyses and presentation of Deutsche Banc on the financial
              aspects of the merger, and its written opinion addressed and
              delivered to the special committee that, as of August 23, 2001,
              based upon and subject to the considerations set forth in its
              opinion, the $2.25 per share merger consideration to be received
              by holders of our common stock was fair from a financial point of
              view to those holders, other than Alpine;

         o    the fact that the shareholder's agreement provides that, in the
              event the merger agreement is terminated and Steelcase exercises
              its option to purchase Alpine's shares, Steelcase must promptly
              commence a tender offer to purchase all other outstanding equity
              interests in PolyVision for the same consideration provided in the
              merger agreement;

         o    the fact that Steelcase's offer was expressly conditioned on your
              board's approval of the shareholder's agreement;

         o    the fact that Steelcase's obligations under the merger agreement
              are not conditioned on its obtaining financing;

         o    the potential conflicts of interest of several executive officers
              and directors of PolyVision with respect to the merger in relation
              to your interests as a shareholder;

         o    the structure of the merger as an all-cash statutory merger, which
              the special committee believed was more attractive than a
              stock-for-stock merger, an asset sale or a tender offer;

         o    the fact that the merger is a fully taxable transaction to you;

         o    the terms of the merger agreement, including our representations
              and warranties, the closing conditions of the parties to the
              merger and the restrictions imposed on the conduct of our business
              prior to completion of the merger, which were extensively
              negotiated by the special committee;

         o    our ability to become fully informed as to alternative
              transactions that could lead to superior offers, and our inability
              to terminate the merger agreement if we receive a superior
              acquisition proposal, or if your board withdraws or changes its
              recommendation that you vote to adopt the merger agreement;

         o    the amount and scope of the termination fee payable to Steelcase
              under the merger agreement, which the special committee did not
              consider unusual in relation to similar and customary transactions
              negotiated at arm's-length; and

         o    the requirement for adoption of the merger agreement by holders of
              at least 66-2/3% of the shares of our common stock, series B
              preferred stock and series C preferred stock, voting together as a
              single class.

         This discussion of the factors considered is not intended to be
exhaustive but includes the principal factors considered by the special
committee and the board of directors. No particular weight or rank was assigned
to these factors, and the special committee considered all factors as a whole
and overall considered them to support its conclusion that the merger is
advisable, fair to you and in your best interests, and to support its unanimous
recommendation to the full board of directors of PolyVision that it approve the
merger and adopt the merger agreement.

         For serving on the special committee, the three members received
customary board committee fees of $500 for each of the six committee meetings
they attended, plus reimbursement for their out-of-pocket expenses in connection
with attendance at these meetings.

         Your board of directors, upon the recommendation of the special
committee of independent directors and consideration of the above factors, among
others, has determined that the merger is advisable, fair to you and in your
best interests. Accordingly, your board of directors has unanimously approved
the merger and adopted the merger agreement and recommends that you vote to
adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.

Opinion of Special Committee Financial Advisor

         Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc. acted as financial advisor to the
special committee in connection with the merger. At the August 22, 2001 meeting
of the special committee, Deutsche Banc delivered its oral opinion to the effect
that, based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and
limits of the review undertaken by Deutsche Banc, the cash merger price of $2.25
per share to be received by PolyVision's common shareholders in the merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to those shareholders, other than Alpine.
Deutsche Banc's oral opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing to the
special committee on August 23, 2001.

         Deutsche Banc's opinion is directed to the special committee to assist
it in connection with its consideration of the proposed merger and relates only
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the cash merger price of
$2.25 per share to be received in the merger by PolyVision's common shareholders
to such shareholders, other than Alpine. Deutsche Banc's opinion does not relate
to any other aspect of the merger, and does not constitute a recommendation to
PolyVision or its shareholders as to the merger or as to how PolyVision
shareholders should vote with respect to the merger agreement.

         The full text of Deutsche Banc's written opinion, dated August 23,
2001, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters
considered and limits on the review undertaken by Deutsche Banc in connection
with the

opinion, is attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement and we incorporate
it by reference in this proxy statement. You are urged to read the opinion
carefully and in its entirety. The summary of Deutsche Banc's opinion set forth
in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion.

         In connection with Deutsche Banc's role as financial advisor to the
special committee, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Banc has:

         o    reviewed certain publicly available financial and other
              information concerning PolyVision and certain internal analyses,
              financial forecasts and other information furnished to it by the
              senior management of PolyVision;

         o    discussed with members of the special committee and of the senior
              management of PolyVision the business and prospects of the
              company;

         o    discussed with members of the special committee certain
              transaction alternatives to the merger;

         o    reviewed the historical reported prices and trading activity for
              PolyVision common stock;

         o    compared certain financial and stock market information for
              PolyVision with similar information for certain other companies
              whose securities are publicly traded;

         o    reviewed the financial terms of certain recent mergers and
              business combinations which it deemed comparable in whole or in
              part to the merger;

         o    reviewed the terms of the merger agreement,
              the shareholder's agreement and certain related documents; and

         o    performed such other studies and analyses and considered such
              economic, financial and market criteria and other factors as it
              deemed appropriate.

         In preparing its opinion, Deutsche Banc did not assume responsibility
for the independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any
information, whether publicly available or furnished to it, concerning
PolyVision including, without limitation, any financial information, forecasts
or projections, considered in connection with the rendering of its opinion.
Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, Deutsche Banc assumed and relied upon
the accuracy and completeness of all information it reviewed. Deutsche Banc did
not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did
not prepare or obtain any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities of PolyVision. With respect to management's financial
forecasts and projections made available to Deutsche Banc and used in its
analyses, Deutsche Banc has assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
senior management of PolyVision, as they relate to the matters covered by them.
In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Banc expresses no view as to the
reasonableness of those forecasts and projections, or the assumptions on which
they are based. Deutsche Banc's written opinion was based upon the economic,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available
to Deutsche Banc, as of August 23, 2001, and Deutsche Banc undertook no
obligation to update its opinion to reflect any developments occurring after
that date.

         For purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Banc has assumed that,
in all respects material to its analyses, the representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement are and will remain true and correct, each
party to the merger agreement will perform all of the covenants and agreements
to be performed by it under the merger agreement, and all conditions to the
obligations of each of the parties to the merger agreement to consummate the
merger will be satisfied without any waiver thereof. Deutsche Banc has also
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and
consents required in connection with the consummation of the merger will be
obtained.

         Set forth below is a summary of all material financial analysis
performed by Deutsche Banc in connection with its opinion and reviewed with the
special committee at its meeting on August 22, 2001.

         Premium analysis. Based on data from Securities Data Corporation,
Deutsche Banc reviewed the premia paid in selected transactions in diversified
industries (excluding financial institutions, technology and regulated
industries) since August 1999, where the entire equity interest in the target
company was acquired and where the enterprise value - defined

as equity market capitalization adjusted for debt and capital lease obligations
and excluding cash on hand - of the target company was within a range of $50.0
million to $200.0 million.

         The following table sets forth certain of the results of these
calculations:

                                               Premia on selected transactions in diversified industries over share
                                                                   price prior to announcement

     Mean                                             40.6                     43.3                    52.1
     Median                                           36.4                     39.1                    48.2

         All premia for the selected transactions were calculated based on
public information available at the time of announcement of such transactions,
without taking into account differing market and other conditions existing at
the time the transactions occurred. Because the reasons for, and circumstances
surrounding, each of the transactions in the sample set were so diverse, and due
to the inherent differences between the operations and financial conditions of
PolyVision, on the one hand, and the companies involved in the selected
transactions, on the other hand, Deutsche Banc believes the analysis of premiums
paid in the selected transactions is not simply mathematical. Rather, it
involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in Deutsche
Banc's written opinion, concerning differences in the financial and operating
characteristics of the companies, prevailing market conditions and other factors
that could affect the public trading value of the companies.

         Deutsche Banc also observed the implied offer price premia/discount
relative to the following selected historical share price information for
PolyVision common stock:

     Six month weighted average (1) ($1.24)                                                                  81.5

     (1) Volume weighted average

         Analysis of Selected Publicly-Traded Companies. Deutsche Banc compared
certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements relating
to PolyVision with the corresponding information and measurements for selected
office and institutional furniture manufacturers, ancillary office and
institutional product suppliers, educational product supply companies and
graphics and display companies.

         Financial information and valuation measurements reviewed by Deutsche
Banc included, among other things:

         o    common equity market valuations as of August 20, 2001;

         o    operating performance;

         o    ratios of stock prices to historical and estimated earnings per
              share (EPS) for 2001 and 2002; and

         o    ratios of enterprise value, to latest twelve months (LTM) revenue,
              earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and earnings before
              interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

         The companies reviewed included office and institutional furniture
manufacturers, ancillary office and institutional product supply companies,
educational product supply companies, and graphics and display companies with an
enterprise value of less than $1.0 billion. The following table lists the
companies reviewed:

o        CompX International Inc.
o        Chromcraft Revington
         Inc.
o        Flexsteel Industries

         To calculate the trading multiples for the selected peer group
companies, Deutsche Banc used publicly available information concerning the
selected peer group companies' LTM revenue, net income, EBIT and EBITDA. Due to
differences in depreciation and amortization allowances, the most relevant
multiples were determined by Deutsche Banc to be multiples of EBITDA. Estimates
of 2001 and 2002 EPS were based on estimates published by IBES, a data service
that compiles estimates of securities research analysts.

         The following table sets forth the material results of these
calculations:

                                                  Enterprise value to LTM EBITDA

PolyVision (based on $2.25 offer price)                      7.9x

         None of the companies utilized as a comparison is identical to
PolyVision. Accordingly, Deutsche Banc believes the analysis of selected
publicly traded companies is not simply mathematical. Rather, it involves
complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in Deutsche Banc's
written opinion, concerning differences in financial and operating
characteristics of the companies analyzed and other factors that could affect
the public trading value of the companies.

         Analysis of Selected Precedent Transactions. Deutsche Banc reviewed the
financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of proposed, pending or
completed acquisition transactions since August 1999 involving office and
institutional furniture manufacturers, ancillary office and institutional
product suppliers, educational product supply companies, and graphics and
display companies. All multiples for the selected precedent transactions were
based on public information available at the time of announcement of such
transactions, without taking into account differing market and other conditions
existing at the time of the transactions occurred. Because the reasons for, and
circumstances surrounding, each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed
were so diverse, and due to the inherent differences between the operations and
financial conditions of PolyVision, on the one hand, and the companies involved
in the selected precedent transactions, on the other hand, Deutsche Banc
believes that a selected precedent transactions analysis is not simply
mathematical.

Rather, it involves complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected
in Deutsche Banc's written opinion, concerning differences between the
characteristics of these transactions and the merger that could affect the value
of the subject companies and PolyVision.

         The results of this analysis are set forth below:

         Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Deutsche Banc also prepared a discounted
cash flow analysis that was based upon financial projections prepared by
PolyVision's senior management. In performing this analysis, Deutsche Banc used
discount rates ranging from 12% to 16% and terminal EBITDA multiples ranging
from 5.0x to 6.5x. This analysis resulted in a range of net implied present
values per share of PolyVision common stock of $5.18 to $10.07. Deutsche Banc
also performed sensitivity analyses on the financial projections which were
discussed with management. Specifically, Deutsche Banc analyzed the impact on
net implied present values per share using differing assumptions concerning
projected revenue growth rates (specifically the revenue growth rates of the
visual communications interactive products group), projected gross margins and
capital expenditures. The sensitivity analyses resulted in a range of net
implied present equity values per share of PolyVision's common stock of $1.81 to
$5.27.

         Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary describes analyses and factors
that Deutsche Banc deemed material in its presentation to the special committee,
but is not a comprehensive description of all analyses performed and factors
considered by Deutsche Banc in connection with preparing its opinion. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application
of subjective business judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances. Deutsche Banc believes that its analyses must be
considered as a whole and that considering any portion of the analyses and of
the factors considered without considering all analyses and factors could create
a misleading view of the process underlying the opinion. In arriving at its
fairness determination, Deutsche Banc did not assign specific weights to any
particular analyses. With respect to the discounted cash flow analysis, Deutsche
Banc believes it appropriate to give greater emphasis to the sensitivity
analyses since overall profitability was significantly impacted by projected
revenues in the visual communications interactive products group.

         In conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinions, Deutsche Banc
utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation methods. The analyses were
prepared solely for the purpose of enabling Deutsche Banc to provide its opinion
to the special committee as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to
PolyVision's common shareholders, other than Alpine, of the cash merger price of
$2.25 per share and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which are
inherently subject to uncertainty. In connection with its analyses, Deutsche
Banc made, and was provided by PolyVision's senior management with, numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond PolyVision's control.
Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not necessarily
indicative of actual past or future values or results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by the analyses. Because
such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous
factors or events beyond the control of PolyVision, neither PolyVision nor
Deutsche Banc nor any other person assumes responsibility if future results or
actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions.

         The terms of the merger agreement were determined through negotiations
between PolyVision's senior management and the special committee and its legal
advisors, on the one hand, and Steelcase and its legal and financial advisors,
on the other hand, and were unanimously approved by PolyVision's board of
directors based upon the special committee's recommendation, and the decision to
enter into the merger agreement was solely that of PolyVision's board of
directors based upon the special committee's recommendation. As described above,
the opinion and presentation of Deutsche Banc to the special committee was only
one of a number of factors taken into consideration by PolyVision's board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. Deutsche
Banc's opinion was provided to the special committee to assist it in connection
with its consideration of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to
any holder of PolyVision common stock as to how to vote with respect to the
merger.

         The special committee selected Deutsche Banc as financial advisor in
connection with the merger based on Deutsche Banc's qualifications, expertise,
reputation and experience in public company mergers and acquisitions. Deutsche
Banc is a registered broker-dealer and member of the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. Deutsche Banc is an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (known with its
affiliates as the "DB Group"). One or more members of the DB Group have, from
time to time, provided investment banking and other financial services to
PolyVision and to Alpine and its affiliates, for which it has received
compensation. In the ordinary course of business, members of the DB Group may
actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of
PolyVision and Alpine for their own accounts and for the accounts of their
customers. Accordingly, Deutsche Banc and its affiliates may at any time hold a
long or short position in such securities, instruments and obligations.

         Payments to Deutsche Banc. The special committee and PolyVision
retained Deutsche Banc pursuant to a letter agreement, dated August 15, 2001. As
compensation for Deutsche Banc's services in connection with the merger,
PolyVision has paid Deutsche Banc a cash fee of $50,000 upon execution of the
letter agreement, a fee of $200,000 payable upon delivery of the fairness
opinion and has agreed to pay Deutsche Banc a fee of $50,000 upon consummation
of the merger. Regardless of whether the merger is consummated, PolyVision has
agreed to indemnify Deutsche Banc and related parties against specified
liabilities arising out of its engagement, and to reimburse Deutsche Banc for
all reasonable fees and disbursements incurred in connection with its
engagement.

Financial Projections

         In connection with Steelcase's due diligence review and during the
course of our negotiations with Steelcase in connection with the proposed
merger, we provided Steelcase with projections of our future operating
performance. These projections, which we do not ordinarily make available to the
public, included the following significant items in the forecast:

                                                              Six-Year Projections
                                                    (in thousands, except per share data)

                                                2001          2002          2003          2004          2005          2006
                                                ----          ----          ----          ----          ----          ----

   Net sales...........................       $162,343      $186,198      $207,171      $234,862      $258,360      $285,897
   Operating income....................         20,732        28,207        33,234        39,804        44,742        50,918
   Earnings before interest, taxes,
   depreciation and amortization.......         26,219        34,437        39,941        47,011        52,322        58,978
   Net income attributable to common
   shareholders........................          3,820         8,253        11,586        16,359        21,070        24,631
   Net income per diluted share........           0.22          0.38          0.50          0.66          0.82          0.94

          Results for 2001 do not reflect non-recurring and restructuring
charges of approximately $800,000 before income taxes.

          These projections are included in this proxy statement only because we
made them available to Steelcase, and both we and Steelcase wish to make the
same information available to PolyVision shareholders. The inclusion of the
projections should not be interpreted as suggesting that Steelcase considered
the projections reliable or relied on the projections in evaluating the merger.
The projections should be read together with our financial statements that can
be obtained from the SEC as described below under the section entitled "Where
You Can Find More Information."

         The projections were prepared for internal use only and were not
prepared with a view to public disclosure or compliance with published
guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants regarding projections and forecasts. The
projections were not intended to be a forecast of financial results and are not
guarantees of performance. The projections do not purport to present operations
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and our independent
auditors have not examined or compiled the projections. The projections involve
risks and are based upon a variety of assumptions relating to our business and
technology, industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters and are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies,
many of which are beyond our and Steelcase's control. Projections of this nature
are inherently imprecise, and there can be no assurances that they will be
realized or that actual results will not differ significantly from those
described above. These projections are subjective in many respects and thus
susceptible to interpretations and periodic revision based on actual experience
and business developments. The principal component of the improved
operating performance shown in the projections is expected revenue growth from
our visual communications interactive products group. This group has been
developed over the past 18 months through internal growth and acquisitions, and
projections for it rely on the successful design, implementation and market
acceptance of new technology-based visual communications products. The growth of
this group and sales of its products are estimates only. Because of the greater
uncertainties of designing, manufacturing and gaining acceptance of new
products, our board of directors concurred with Deutsche Banc in ascribing
greater emphasis to the lower range of net implied present values from the
sensitivity analyses on the financial projections described in the section
"Opinion of Special Committee Financial Advisor" above.

         There can be no assurance that the assumptions made in
preparing the projections will prove accurate. It is expected that there will be
differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be
materially greater or less than those contained in the projections. None of
Steelcase, PolyVision or any of their respective affiliates or representatives
has made or makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate
performance of PolyVision compared to the information contained in the
projections, and none of them has updated or otherwise revised or intends to
update or otherwise revise the projections to reflect circumstances existing
after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in
the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are
shown to be in error.

         Neither PolyVision nor Steelcase nor any of PolyVision's or Steelcase's
respective directors or financial advisors accepts any responsibility for these
projections or the bases or assumptions on which they were prepared.

Form of the Merger

         If our shareholders adopt the merger agreement and all other conditions
to completing the merger are met or, if permissible, waived, PV Acquisition will
be merged with and into PolyVision, and PolyVision will survive the merger as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Steelcase. After the consummation of the merger:

         o    you will have no continuing equity interest in PolyVision, and you
              will not be able to share in any of PolyVision's future earnings,
              dividends or growth;

         o    our common stock will no longer be publicly traded on the American
              Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or
              automated quotation system; and

         o    PolyVision will no longer be required to file periodic reports,
              such as an annual report on Form 10-K or a quarterly report on
              Form 10-Q, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The merger is structured as an all-cash statutory merger, which your
board believes is more attractive than a stock-for-stock merger, an asset sale
or a tender offer for a variety of reasons, including:

         o    the absence of market risk otherwise associated with the receipt
              of securities as merger consideration;

         o    the simplicity of paying cash to you, as opposed to issuing
              securities or other consideration to you;

         o    the ability of the parties to complete the merger in a single
              step, rather than a front-end purchase of a controlling interest
              with a second-step merger to acquire 100% of the equity; and

         o    the ability of the parties to reduce overall transaction costs and
              for Steelcase to realize anticipated tax benefits, increasing the
              amount of the net merger consideration available to be paid to you
              in the merger.

Interests of Persons in the Merger

         In considering the recommendation of your board of directors with
respect to the merger, you should be aware that, as described below, several
members of your board of directors and our management team may have interests in
the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a
shareholder, and that may create potential conflicts of interest.

         o    Common PolyVision-Alpine board members. Three members of your
              board of directors, Steven S. Elbaum, James R. Kanely and Bragi F.
              Schut, are also directors and shareholders of Alpine, our
              principal shareholder. In addition, Mr. Elbaum, the chairman of
              your board of directors, is also the chairman of the board and
              chief executive officer of Alpine. At the closing of the merger,
              Alpine will receive approximately $15.3 million for its shares of
              our common stock, $16.2 million for its shares of our series B
              preferred stock, including $3.4 million on account of accrued and
              unpaid dividends, and $9.8 million for its shares of our series C
              preferred stock, including $1.7 million on account of accrued and
              unpaid dividends.

         o    Payments to senior executive officers of PolyVision after the
              merger. When the merger agreement was signed, Steelcase and
              Michael H. Dunn, our president and chief executive officer, signed
              an employment and non-competition agreement, which will become
              effective when the merger is completed. See "Related Agreements-
              Employment and Non-Competition Agreements." At the effective time
              of the merger, this new employment agreement will supersede Mr.
              Dunn's existing employment agreement with us, and the existing
              employment agreement will cease to have any effect. Under his new
              employment agreement, Mr. Dunn will be paid a signing bonus of
              $900,000 within five days after the merger, and a retention bonus
              of $200,000, payable in amounts of $100,000 on the first
              anniversary of the merger and $100,000 on the second anniversary
              of the merger, so long as Mr. Dunn's employment has not been
              terminated prior to that date. If the merger is completed, Mr.
              Dunn will not be eligible for any benefits that otherwise might
              have been provided after the merger under his existing employment
              agreement. Under his existing employment agreement, Mr. Dunn would
              have been entitled to specified payments (including a lump sum
              cash payment equal to three times the sum of his base salary
              immediately prior to termination and his highest annual bonus
              during the three full fiscal years prior to the merger) and
              various other benefits if his employment were terminated after the
              merger by us without cause or by Mr. Dunn with good reason (as
              those terms are defined in his existing employment agreement).
              Separately, as a result of Mr. Dunn's ownership interest in Wind
              Point Partners prior to joining PolyVision, he will also receive

              approximately $1.1 million of the payment under the $8.0 million
              convertible promissory note held by Wind Point Partners.

              In addition, amendments to the employment agreements of Gregory D.
              Cessna, president of our visual communication products division,
              Gary L. Edwards our chief financial officer, treasurer and
              secretary, and Ian G. Hutchinson, president of our visual
              communications surfaces division, will become effective when the
              merger is completed. See "Related Agreements-Employment and Non-
              Competition Agreements." Each of these amendments will provide the
              executive with a one-time bonus payment equal to his annual base
              salary in the respective amounts of $220,000, $208,000 and
              $208,000 within five days after the merger is completed. As a
              result of these amendments, if the merger is completed, these
              executives will not be entitled to some benefits that might
              otherwise have been provided under the terms of their respective
              employment agreements as currently in effect.

         o    Stock options granted to executive officers and directors of
              PolyVision. 1,637,142 shares of our common stock are subject to
              stock options granted to executive officers and directors of
              PolyVision under various stock option plans, of which 1,220,014
              options have exercise prices below $2.25 per share. Messrs. Dunn,
              Cessna, Edwards and Hutchinson hold in-the-money options
              exercisable for 450,000, 100,000, 100,000 and 100,000 shares of
              our common stock, respectively. In the merger, each outstanding
              option to purchase our common stock will be cancelled in exchange
              for a cash payment equal to the product of the total number of
              shares of our common stock subject to the option, multiplied by
              the excess, if any, of $2.25 over the exercise price of the
              option. This will result in our executive officers and directors
              receiving total cash payments of $883,432 in respect of their
              options, including $343,000, $25,000, $25,000 and $25,000 to
              Messrs. Dunn, Cessna, Edwards and Hutchinson, respectively.

         o    Continuing indemnification and insurance. Under the merger
              agreement, Steelcase is required to cause all rights to
              indemnification by PolyVision of each present and former director
              or officer of PolyVision to continue in full force and effect for
              at least six years after the merger. In addition, Steelcase is
              required to cause PolyVision to indemnify PolyVision's present and
              former directors and officers for acts or omissions occurring
              before the merger. Steelcase also has agreed to cause PolyVision
              to maintain, for not less than three years after the merger,
              directors' and officers' liability insurance of $10.0 million
              covering PolyVision's present and former directors and officers on
              terms similar to PolyVision's existing directors' and officers'
              liability insurance. However, Steelcase is not required to pay an
              annual premium of more than approximately $220,000, representing
              200% of PolyVision's average annual premiums over the past three
              years, to maintain this insurance.

         The special committee and your board of directors were aware of these
interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger.

         If the merger is completed, Steelcase intends to recommend that its
board of directors grant Messrs. Dunn, Cessna, Edwards and Hutchinson options to
purchase 10,000, 3,000, 3,000 and 3,000 shares, respectively, of Steelcase
stock as part of Steelcase's customary practice to grant options to key
executives of its subsidiaries.

Conduct of PolyVision's Business if the Merger is not Completed

         If the merger is not completed, we intend to continue to operate our
business substantially in the manner in which it is operated today and, from
time to time, we will evaluate and review our business, operations, properties,
corporate structure, dividend policy and capitalization, make changes as are
deemed appropriate, and continue to seek to identify strategic alternatives to
maximize shareholder value.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

         The following summary discusses the material United States federal
income tax consequences of the merger to a PolyVision shareholder whose shares
of common stock are surrendered in the merger. You should keep in mind that this
discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, U.S.
Treasury regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code, and judicial
decisions and administrative rulings and interpretations of the Internal Revenue
Code, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement, all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary applies only
to shareholders who hold their shares of PolyVision common stock as a capital
asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.

         The discussion does not address the effects of any state, local or
foreign tax laws. In addition, the tax consequences discussed do not address all
aspects of federal taxation that may be relevant to a particular shareholder in
light of personal circumstances or to shareholders who are subject to special
treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including:

         o    shareholders who, at the effective time of the merger, are not
              U.S. persons;

         o    tax-exempt organizations;

         o    dealers in securities or foreign currency;

         o    insurance companies;

         o    banks, trusts or financial institutions; and

         o    shareholders who acquired our common stock through exercise of an
              employee stock option or otherwise as compensation or through a
              tax-qualified retirement plan.

         You are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the particular tax
consequences to you of the merger, including the applicability and effect of any
state, local or foreign tax laws, and of changes in any applicable tax laws.

         You will receive cash in the merger in exchange for your shares of our
common stock. Receipt of the cash in the merger will be a taxable transaction
for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code. In general, for
federal income tax purposes, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between the cash you receive in the merger and your adjusted tax
basis in the shares of our common stock you surrender. This gain or loss will be
a capital gain or loss. The rate at which any gain will be taxed to
non-corporate shareholders, including individuals, estates and trusts, will, as
a general matter, depend upon each shareholder's holding period for the shares
of common stock at the time of the merger. If a non-corporate shareholder's
holding period for the shares of common stock is more than one year, either a
20% or a 10% capital gains rate generally will apply to the gain, depending on
the shareholder's amount of taxable income for that year. If your holding period
for the shares of common stock is one year or less, the gain will be taxed at
the same rates as ordinary income. Capital loss generally is deductible only to
the extent of capital gain plus ordinary income of up to $3,000. Net capital
loss in excess of $3,000 may be carried forward to subsequent taxable years.

         For corporations, capital losses are allowed only to the extent of
capital gains, and net capital gain is taxed at the same rates as ordinary
income. Corporations generally may carry capital losses back up to three years
and forward up to five years.

         Payment in connection with the merger may be subject to "backup
withholding" at a 30.5% rate if made prior to December 31, 2001, or a 30% rate
if made after that date. Backup withholding generally applies if the shareholder
fails to furnish such shareholder's social security number or other taxpayer
identification number, or furnishes an incorrect number. Backup withholding is
not an additional tax but merely a creditable advance payment which may be
refunded to the extent it results in an overpayment of tax, provided that
specific required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. Some
persons generally are exempt from backup withholding, including corporations and
financial institutions. Penalties apply for failure to furnish correct
information and for failure to include reportable payments in income.
Shareholders should consult with their own tax advisers as to the qualifications
and procedures for exemption from backup withholding.

Regulatory Approvals

         We are not aware of any federal or state regulatory requirements that
must be complied with or approvals that must be obtained to consummate the
merger, other than filing a certificate of merger with the Department of State
of the State of New York and filing this proxy statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. If any additional approvals or filings are required, we
will use our best efforts to obtain those approvals and make any required
filings before completing the merger.

No Financing Contingency

         Steelcase has represented in the merger agreement that it has available
and has reserved, or has received written commitments from third-party lenders
to obtain, sufficient funds to consummate the merger, including the payment in
full of the merger consideration, cash settlements with respect to our stock
options, warrants and convertible note, and all of our outstanding indebtedness,
including principal, accrued interest, prepayment fees and other charges. There
is no condition to Steelcase's obligations under the merger agreement that
Steelcase obtain financing before completing the merger.

No Dissenters' Rights

         We are incorporated under New York law. Under New York law, you do not
have any dissenters' rights, rights of appraisal or similar rights to receive a
judicial valuation of your shares of PolyVision common stock in connection with
the merger. Holders of shares of our preferred stock have previously waived
their dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

Other Effects of the Merger

         Our common stock is currently traded on the American Stock Exchange
under the symbol "PLI." Upon consummation of the merger, our common stock will
no longer be traded on the American Stock Exchange and will be deregistered
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

         The following summary of the material terms of the merger agreement is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is
incorporated by reference in its entirety and attached as Appendix A to this
proxy statement. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its
entirety.

The Merger

         The merger agreement provides for the merger of Steelcase's
wholly-owned subsidiary, PV Acquisition, Inc., with and into PolyVision,
following adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite vote of our
shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver, as permitted, of the other
conditions to completing the merger. Following the merger, PolyVision will be
the surviving corporation and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steelcase.
PolyVision will continue to exist following the merger and its internal affairs
will continue to be governed by New York law. Steelcase, as the only shareholder
of PolyVision following the merger, will have sole power and authority to
control all aspects of internal corporate and business affairs of PolyVision
following the merger.

Effective Time of the Merger

         If the merger agreement is adopted by the requisite vote of our
shareholders and the other conditions to the respective obligations of the
parties to consummate the merger are either satisfied or waived, as permitted,
the merger will be consummated and will become effective on the date that a
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Department of State of the State of
New York or a later date as agreed upon by the parties. That date is referred to
as the "effective time."

Treatment of PolyVision Securities

         At the effective time of the merger:

         o    each outstanding share of our common stock, other than shares held
              in our treasury and shares owned by Steelcase or any of its
              subsidiaries, will be cancelled and automatically converted into
              the right to receive $2.25 in cash, without interest, less any
              withholding taxes;

         o    each outstanding share of our series B preferred stock and series
              D preferred stock will be cancelled and automatically converted
              into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of:

              -   $50.00, representing the liquidation preference of such share,
                  plus

              -   any and all accrued and unpaid dividends in respect of the
                  share of series B or series D preferred stock, without
                  interest, less any withholding taxes;

         o    each outstanding share of our series C preferred stock will be
              cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive an
              amount in cash equal to the product of:

              -   $2.25, multiplied by

              -   the number of shares of our common stock into which
                  the share of series C preferred stock is convertible
                  immediately before the effective time of the merger,
                  without interest, less any withholding taxes; and

         o    each outstanding stock option to purchase our common stock, the
              vesting of all of which will be accelerated immediately prior to
              the effective time of the merger, will be cancelled in exchange
              for a cash payment equal to the product of:

              -   the number of shares of our common stock subject to the
                  option immediately before the effective time of the merger,
                  multiplied by

              -   the excess, if any, of $2.25 over the exercise price of the
                  option.

         Accordingly, no payment will be made in respect of outstanding stock
options with an exercise price of $2.25 per share or more, and these options
will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger.

         From and after the effective time of the merger:

         o    each outstanding warrant to purchase our common stock will
              represent the right to receive, upon exercise of the warrant and
              payment of the exercise price, a cash payment equal to the product
              of:

              -   $2.25, multiplied by

              -   the number of shares of our common stock into which
                  the warrant was exercisable immediately before the
                  effective time of the merger, without interest, less
                  any withholding taxes; and

         o    our $8.0 million 10% convertible promissory note issued to Wind
              Point Partners III, L.P. will represent the right, upon conversion
              of the note in accordance with its terms, to receive a cash
              payment equal to the product of:

              -   $2.25, multiplied by

              -   the number of shares of our common stock into which
                  the note was convertible immediately before the
                  effective time of the merger, without interest, less
                  any withholding taxes.

         No interest will accrue or be paid on any portion of the merger
consideration to be paid under the merger agreement. Under some circumstances,
the merger consideration could be reduced by stock transfer and withholding
taxes applicable to you. In the event the number of outstanding PolyVision
shares or shares issuable upon the conversion of securities or the exercise of
options exceeds the amounts represented in the merger agreement as being
outstanding or issuable, including as a result of any stock split, the per-share
merger consideration will be appropriately adjusted downward.

         Because the conversion promissory note issued to Wind Point Partners
has a conversion price in excess of $2.25 per share, we do not anticipate that
Wind Point Partners will elect to convert the note. Steelcase has advised us
that, in connection with the closing of the merger, it intends to pay, or cause
to be paid, our outstanding indebtedness under the convertible promissory note.

Exchange of PolyVision Stock Certificates

         Promptly after the effective time of the merger, American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, as the paying agent, will mail to you a letter of
transmittal and instructions for you to use in surrendering your share
certificates. When you properly surrender your share certificates to the agent
for cancellation, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and any
other documents as the agent may require, the agent will promptly deliver to you
a check payable to you in the amount to which you are entitled in accordance
with the merger agreement, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings,
and your certificates will be canceled. Until properly surrendered, each
certificate representing shares of our common stock will be deemed, at any time
after the effective time of the merger, to represent only the right to receive
$2.25 in cash, without interest, for each share of our common stock represented
by the certificate.

         PolyVision is entitled to cause the paying agent to deliver to it any
funds that have not been disbursed within six months after the effective time of
the merger. After that date, holders of certificates who have not complied with
the instructions to exchange their certificates will be entitled to look to
PolyVision for payment as general creditors with respect to the cash payable
upon surrender of their certificates.

         You should not send in your share certificates before you receive a
letter of transmittal and instructions from the paying agent.

Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws

         The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger,
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of PV Acquisition will become the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of PolyVision, as the surviving
corporation, except that the name of the surviving corporation will be changed
to PolyVision Corporation.

Officers and Directors of PolyVision Following the Merger

         After the effective time of the merger, the members of the board of
directors of PV Acquisition will become the directors of PolyVision, and the
current officers of PolyVision will continue as the officers of PolyVision, in
each case until their successors are duly elected, appointed and qualified.

Board Recommendation

         Neither your board of directors nor the special committee may withdraw,
modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Steelcase, its recommendation that
you vote to adopt the merger agreement unless it determines, in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under

applicable law. In that case, your board of directors and the special committee
have the right to withdraw or change this recommendation at any time.

         The merger agreement provides that, even if your board of directors or
the special committee withdraws or changes its recommendation to you, we must
still hold the special meeting and submit to you the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement for your consideration.

Representations and Warranties

         The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of
PolyVision and its subsidiaries, relating to, among other things:

Conduct of Business of PolyVision Prior to the Merger

         We have covenanted and agreed that, except as expressly contemplated by
the merger agreement or as Steelcase may consent in writing during the period
between August 24, 2001 and the effective time of the merger:

         o    we will conduct our business and the business of our subsidiaries
              only in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent
              with past practice, and we and our subsidiaries will use our
              reasonable efforts to preserve our present business organizations
              intact and maintain good relations with customers, suppliers,
              employees, independent contractors, dealers, distributors and
              other persons with whom we or any of our subsidiaries has
              significant business relations;

                  payable in cash, stock or property with respect to our
                  capital stock, except, in the case of the PolyVision, for
                  quarterly dividends,

              -   transfer, lease, license, sell, mortgage, pledge, dispose of,

                  the ordinary course of business consistent with past
                  practice, or

              made by us inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the

              writing or announce an intention to do any of the foregoing.

Access and Confidentiality

         The merger agreement grants Steelcase reasonable access to PolyVision's
business documents and real property. PolyVision has agreed, until the effective
time of the merger, to:

         o    upon reasonable notice and subject to the terms of the mutual
              confidentiality agreement, dated August 8, 2000, between
              PolyVision and Steelcase, afford the officers, employees,
              accountants, counsel, financing sources and other representatives
              of Steelcase reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
              all of PolyVision's and its subsidiaries' properties, books,
              contracts, commitments and records;

         o    afford Steelcase and their respective representatives such access
              to any site located on PolyVision's real property as may
              reasonably be requested by Steelcase for the purpose of conducting
              Phase I environmental assessments; and

         o    furnish Steelcase with all information concerning its business,
              properties and personnel as Steelcase may reasonably request,
              including a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
              and other document filed or received by it during such period
              pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws.

Determination Letters; Multiemployer Plans

         Under the merger agreement, we are required to apply for a
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that each
of our employee benefit plans that is intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is so qualified. Prior to
the effective time of the merger, we are required to deliver to Steelcase a
letter from the board of trustees of each plan to which we or any of our
subsidiaries make contributions that is a multiemployer plan within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (known as ERISA), to the effect that there is no unfunded liability with
respect to our participation in such plan and stating that neither we nor any of
our subsidiaries would have any withdrawal liability upon a "complete
withdrawal" within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA from such plan if such
withdrawal occurred as of the date of such letter.

Employment and Benefit Arrangements

         The merger agreement provides that Steelcase will, for a one-year
period following the effective time of the merger, cause PolyVision to provide
its employees at the effective time with benefits that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable to such employees as are the benefits of PolyVision provided to
such employees immediately prior to the effective time. This provision does not,
however, apply to severance benefits.

         Steelcase has further agreed to:

         o    for purposes of vesting and eligibility, with respect to each
              benefit required to be provided under the terms of the merger
              agreement, credit each employee with all service credited to such
              employee under PolyVision's corresponding plan, policy, program or
              arrangement applicable to such employee as of the effective time
              of the merger;

         o    credit each employee with any vacation and sick days accrued as of
              the effective time of the merger in accordance with the terms of
              PolyVision's vacation and sick day policies in effect as of that
              date; and

         o    from and after the effective time of the merger, cause PolyVision
              to waive any pre-existing condition limitations and credit any
              deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses that are applicable or
              covered under the benefit plans providing health and dental and
              similar benefits and are incurred by the employees and their
              beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to
              participation, if applicable, in the benefit plans provided by
              Steelcase or its subsidiaries, other than PolyVision.

         These provisions are not intended to create rights of third party
beneficiaries and are not deemed to be a commitment on the part of Steelcase or
the surviving corporation to provide employment to any person for any period of
time.

Transfer of Intellectual Property

         We agreed to use our best efforts to cause all right, title and
interest to our intellectual property for which we or any of our subsidiaries is
not listed as the record owner or which is subject to an encumbrance to be
assigned and transferred, free and clear of any such encumbrance, to Steelcase
or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and to cause such right, title and
interest to be vested in Steelcase or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Standstill Agreements

         During the period from August 24, 2001 to the effective time, we will
enforce and will not terminate, amend, modify or waive any standstill provision
of any confidentiality or standstill agreement between PolyVision and third
parties entered into prior to August 24, 2001.

Takeover Laws

         If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other
form of anti-takeover statute or regulation becomes applicable to any of the
merger transactions or to PolyVision, PolyVision and its board of directors have
agreed to use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that the merger may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the merger
agreement and to minimize the effect of any applicable statute or regulation on
the merger.

Amendment and Modification
         The merger agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or
authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after
adoption of the merger agreement by the shareholders of PolyVision. Until the
effective time of the merger, all action to be taken by PolyVision to amend or
modify the merger agreement also requires the approval of the special committee.
After the adoption of the merger agreement, no amendment may be made to the
extent that applicable law requires further approval of the amendment by the
shareholders of PolyVision, without obtaining their further approval. All
amendments to the merger agreement must be in writing signed by each party.

Fees and Expenses

         All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated by it will be paid by the party incurring the
expense.

         The respective obligations of each of the parties to complete the
merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver, to the extent permitted under
applicable law, at or prior to the effective time of the merger, of the

         o    no statute, law, rule or regulation will be in effect or have

                   ability of Steelcase or PV Acquisition to perform their
                   respective obligations under the merger agreement, or

              -    our business, operations, properties (including intangible
                   properties), condition (financial or otherwise), results of
                   operations or assets of PolyVision or its subsidiaries, or

         o    there must not be pending any action or proceeding by any

              -    restrain or prohibit Steelcase's or any of its affiliates'
                   ownership or operation of all or a material portion of our

                   affiliates to dispose of or hold separate all or any material

              -    impose or confirm material limitations on the ability of
                   Steelcase or any of its affiliates to effectively control the

              no court, arbitrator or governmental entity will have issued any
              judgment, order, decree or injunction and there will not be any

              properties), condition (financial or otherwise), results of
              operations or assets of PolyVision or its subsidiaries.

Notification of Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation

         We must promptly notify Steelcase if we or any of our officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents
receive any proposals for or information requests relating to, or any
negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with respect
to, any of the following (each of which is referred to as an "acquisition
proposal"):

         o    any tender or exchange offer involving PolyVision;

         o    any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
              combination involving PolyVision;

         o    any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner any of our equity
              or voting debt securities which, if consummated, would result in
              any person acquiring beneficial ownership of our securities
              representing 10% or more of the outstanding combined voting power
              of PolyVision;

         o    any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner 10% or more of our
              consolidated assets, including the shares of capital stock of our
              subsidiaries;

         o    any proposal or offer with respect to any recapitalization or
              restructuring with respect to PolyVision; or

         o    any proposal or offer with respect to any other transaction
              similar to any of the foregoing with respect to PolyVision, other
              than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

         We have agreed immediately to cease any and all existing discussions,
negotiations and communications with any third party regarding any acquisition
proposal. From August 24, 2001 until the earlier of the termination of the
merger agreement or the effective time of the merger, we have agreed not to
authorize or permit our officers, directors, affiliates or employees, or our
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents, directly or
indirectly, to:

         o    initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate the making of any offer
              or proposal which constitutes or which may be reasonably likely to
              lead to an acquisition proposal;

         o    enter into any agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal;
              or

         o    except as set forth below, in the event of an unsolicited
              acquisition proposal, engage in any negotiations or discussions
              with, or provide any information or data to, any person, other
              than Steelcase, relating to any acquisition proposal.

         In connection with an unsolicited acquisition proposal, we are
permitted to request all information and have discussions with any person as may
be necessary for your board of directors, and the special committee, to inform

themselves fully as to all significant terms and conditions of the acquisition
proposal and provide material, non-public information or data regarding
PolyVision, if:

         o    prior to doing so, your board of directors receives an executed
              confidentiality agreement having customary provisions, as advised
              by outside legal counsel, and otherwise containing terms and
              provisions no less restrictive than those contained in the
              confidentiality agreement we entered into with Steelcase; and

         o    your board of directors, or the special committee, has determined,
              in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
              the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
              duties under applicable law.

         However, having determined in good faith, following consultation with
outside legal counsel, that your board of directors and the special committee
are fully informed with respect to the significant terms and conditions of the
acquisition proposal and its proponent, neither we nor any of our
representatives will be permitted to engage in any discussions that would
violate this provision.

         Your board of directors is permitted to withdraw, modify or qualify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, its recommendation that you
vote to adopt the merger agreement, provided that the board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Your
board of directors is also permitted to make any other disclosure to you which
the board, in its good faith judgment after consultation with outside legal
counsel, deems necessary under applicable law.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

         The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned
at any time prior to the completion of the merger, whether before or after our
shareholders adopt the merger agreement:

         o    by the mutual written consent of Steelcase and PolyVision;

         o    by either Steelcase or PolyVision, if:

              -    any statute, law, rule or regulation is enacted or
                   promulgated by any governmental entity which prohibits the
                   completion of the merger, or if there is an order or
                   injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction in effect
                   prohibiting completion of the merger, and it has become final
                   and nonappealable, or

              -    the merger is not consummated by 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on
                   January 3, 2002, provided that the right to terminate the
                   merger agreement for this reason will not be available to any
                   party whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations under
                   the merger agreement caused the failure of the merger to
                   occur before this time, or

              -    the merger agreement is not adopted by the requisite vote of
                   our shareholders at the special meeting or any adjournment or
                   postponement of the special meeting;

         o    by Steelcase only, if:

              -    our representations and warranties in the merger agreement
                   are not true and correct such that we cannot satisfy the
                   condition in the merger agreement relating to the accuracy of
                   our representations and warranties on or before January 3,
                   2002, or

              -    we materially breach any of our obligations under the merger
                   agreement, and we fail to cure the breach within 30 days
                   following our receipt of notice of the breach, or

              -    your board of directors or the special committee publicly
                   announces that it has withdrawn, or modified or changed in a
                   manner adverse to Steelcase, its recommendation to you to
                   adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting, or has
                   resolved to do so, regardless of whether your board or the
                   special committee is permitted to do so; or

         o    by PolyVision only, if:

              -    the representations and warranties of Steelcase in the merger
                   agreement are not true and correct such that they cannot
                   satisfy the condition in the merger agreement relating to the
                   accuracy of their representations and warranties on or before
                   January 3, 2002, or

              -    either Steelcase or PV Acquisition materially breaches any of
                   its obligations under the merger agreement, and it fails to
                   cure the breach within 30 days following its receipt of
                   notice of the breach.

Termination Fee

         We must pay Steelcase a cash termination fee of $2,650,000, if any of
the following occurs:

         o    We terminate the merger agreement

              -    either because the special meeting was not held and the
                   merger was not completed by 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on
                   January 3, 2002, or because the special meeting was held but
                   the merger agreement was not adopted by our shareholders at
                   the meeting, and

              -    before the merger agreement is terminated, we receive an
                   acquisition proposal that has been publicly announced from an
                   entity not affiliated with Steelcase, and

              -    within 12 months after the merger agreement is terminated, we
                   sign an acquisition agreement with an entity not affiliated
                   with Steelcase.

         o    Steelcase terminates the merger agreement

              -    either because your board of directors or the special
                   committee changed or withdrew its recommendation that you
                   adopt the merger agreement, or because the special meeting
                   was held but the merger agreement was not adopted by our
                   shareholders at the meeting, and

              -    before the merger agreement is terminated, we receive an
                   acquisition proposal that has been publicly announced from an
                   entity not affiliated with Steelcase, and

              -    within 12 months after the merger agreement is terminated, we
                   sign an acquisition agreement with an entity not affiliated
                   with Steelcase.

         Steelcase will not receive the termination fee if it is in material
breach of the merger agreement at the time the merger agreement is terminated.

                               RELATED AGREEMENTS

Shareholder's Agreement

         The following summary of the material terms of the shareholder's
agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the shareholder's
agreement, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety and attached as
Appendix B to this proxy statement. We urge you to read the shareholder's
agreement carefully and its entirety.

         Agreement to vote. In connection with the merger, Alpine, our principal
shareholder, has entered into a shareholder's agreement with Steelcase and PV
Acquisition. The shareholder's agreement provides that through the date of the
closing of the purchase of Alpine's shares following the exercise or expiration
of the call option described below, as applicable, Alpine will vote all of the
shares of PolyVision held of record or beneficially owned by it:

         o    in favor of approval of the merger agreement, all transactions
              contemplated by the merger agreement and any actions required in
              furtherance of the merger agreement and in furtherance of the
              shareholder's agreement;

         o    against any action intended, or which could reasonably be
              expected, to impede or interfere with the merger or result in a
              breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or
              warranty or any other obligation or agreement of PolyVision or its
              subsidiaries under the merger agreement; and

         o    except as specifically requested by Steelcase, against

              -    any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,
                   consolidation or other business combination,

              -    any sale, lease, transfer or disposition by us or any of our
                   subsidiaries of any material assets or any reorganization,
                   recapitalization, dissolution or liquidation of PolyVision or
                   any of our subsidiaries,

              -    any change in the present capitalization of PolyVision or any
                   amendment to our certificate of incorporation or by-laws,

              -    any other material change in the corporate structure or
                   business of PolyVision or any of its subsidiaries, or

              -    any other action that is intended, or could reasonably be
                   expected, to impede, interfere with or prevent the merger or
                   the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

         Irrevocable proxy. Alpine has granted an irrevocable proxy to Steelcase
to vote its shares of PolyVision on the matters and as indicated above. This
proxy is irrevocable during the period of time in which Alpine is bound by the
voting agreement described above. Alpine has retained the right to vote its
shares of PolyVision on all matters other than those identified in the
shareholder's agreement. Alpine was not paid additional consideration in
connection with the shareholder's agreement.

         Grant of call option. Alpine has also granted Steelcase and PV
Acquisition an irrevocable option to purchase for cash all, but not less than
all, of the PolyVision shares held of record or beneficially owned by Alpine at
a purchase price per share equal to $2.25 in cash for the common stock, the
series B preferred stock merger consideration or the series C preferred stock
merger consideration, as applicable (generally referred to as a "call option").
The call option may be exercised at any time from and after any termination of
the merger agreement and prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the 30th day
after the date of such termination.

         The call option closing is subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions:

         o    to the extent necessary, any applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino
              antitrust waiting period has expired or been terminated, and

         o    there is no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
              decree or ruling issued by any court of competent jurisdiction,
              and no statute, law, rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by
              any governmental entity, prohibiting the exercise of the call
              option or the delivery of Alpine's shares.

         If the call option is exercised and Steelcase purchases Alpine's
shares, then as promptly as reasonably practicable but, in any case, not later
than five business days after the call option closing, Steelcase is obligated to
commence a tender offer to purchase for cash all, but not less than all, of the
remaining outstanding shares of PolyVision common stock held by holders other
than Steelcase or PV Acquisition, at $2.25 cash per share, without interest, and
the outstanding shares of series D preferred stock at the series D preferred
stock merger consideration.

         The obligation of Steelcase to accept for payment and to pay for
validly tendered shares in this tender offer is only subject to the following
conditions:

         o    no statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction has
              been enacted, entered, enforced or promulgated by any governmental
              entity which restrains, prevents or prohibits the making or
              consummation of the tender offer or the consummation of a
              second-step merger, provided that Steelcase must use commercially
              reasonable efforts to have any restraint vacated or lifted; and

         o    any other conditions as, after consultation with Steelcase's
              outside legal counsel, Steelcase determines in good faith are
              required by applicable law with respect to the tender offer.

         Following payment for shares tendered in the tender offer, Steelcase
must take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the consummation, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, of a second-step merger (referred to as a
"secondary merger") in which the holders of the remaining outstanding PolyVision
securities will receive net per-share consideration equal to the net per-share
consideration that would have been received by holders of those securities in
the merger.

Steelcase must use its reasonable best efforts to acquire at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of PolyVision common stock in the tender offer, so that the
secondary merger may be consummated pursuant to Section 905 of the New York
Business Corporation Law.

         At all times prior to Steelcase's acquisition of the outstanding shares
of PolyVision common stock, other than shares owned by Steelcase or PV
Acquisition, and options and warrants to purchase PolyVision common stock, the
special committee will be in place to enforce on behalf of PolyVision and the
holders of PolyVision common stock, other than Steelcase or PV Acquisition, and
options and warrants to purchase PolyVision common stock, the provisions
regarding Steelcase's obligations after the call option closing to acquire all
minority interests in PolyVision.

         Indemnification. Alpine agreed to indemnify Steelcase, PV Acquisition,
their officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and affiliates
from and in respect of any and all losses, damages, costs and expenses that any
of these indemnified persons may incur arising out of or due to the inaccuracy
or breach of any representation or warranty of Alpine contained in the
shareholder's agreement, breach by Alpine of any covenant, undertaking or other
agreement contained in the shareholder's agreement and enforcement of these
indemnification rights.

Employment and Non-Competition Agreements

         Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Steelcase
entered into an employment and non-competition agreement with Michael H. Dunn,
PolyVision's president and chief executive officer, which will become effective
upon the consummation of the merger and supersede his existing employment
agreement with PolyVision.

         Under the terms of his new employment agreement, Mr. Dunn agreed to be
employed by Steelcase for a term of three years, serving in the position of
president and chief executive officer of PolyVision, which will then be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Steelcase. In addition to an annual base salary of
$250,000, Mr. Dunn will be paid a signing bonus of $900,000 within five days
after the effective date of the merger, and a retention bonus of $200,000,
payable in amounts of $100,000 on the first anniversary of the effective date
and $100,000 on the second anniversary of the effective date, so long as Mr.
Dunn's employment has not been terminated prior to that date. Mr. Dunn will also
be eligible to participate in an annual incentive compensation program to be
implemented by PolyVision's board following the merger.

         Mr. Dunn's new employment agreement, as compared to his existing
employment agreement, does not provide for equity-based compensation, although
he may participate in Steelcase's incentive compensation plan at the discretion
of its board or compensation committee. In addition, Mr. Dunn's new employment
agreement does not include any change-of-control provisions which were part of
his existing agreement. Under those provisions, Mr. Dunn would have been
entitled to specified payments, including a lump sum cash payment equal to three
times the sum of his base salary immediately prior to termination and his
highest annual bonus during the three full fiscal years prior to the merger, and
various other benefits if his employment were terminated after the merger by us
without cause or by Mr. Dunn with good reason (as those terms are defined in his
existing employment agreement).

         The new employment agreement also contains customary non-competition
and non-solicitation provisions which provide that Mr. Dunn will not, during his
employment and for 24 months after termination of his employment:

         o    engage, directly or indirectly, in competition with Steelcase,
              PolyVision or any of their affiliates within any geographic area
              where they conduct business involving the office furniture
              business;

         o    solicit from any client (or potential client) doing business with
              Steelcase, PolyVision or any of their affiliates any business
              involving office furniture business, or solicit the employment or
              services of any person known to be employed by Steelcase,
              PolyVision or any of their affiliates; or

         o    knowingly interfere with the business or accounts of Steelcase,
              PolyVision or any of their affiliates.

         The new employment agreement was entered into as required by Steelcase
under the merger agreement to assure the continued availability of Mr. Dunn's
services to PolyVision following the effective time of the merger, and the terms
of his employment agreement were determined through arm's-length negotiations
between Mr. Dunn and Steelcase.

         In addition, concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement,
as a condition of Steelcase's acquisition proposal, PolyVision entered into
amendments to the employment agreements of Gregory D. Cessna, president of our
visual communication products division, Gary L. Edwards, our chief financial
officer, treasurer and secretary, and Ian G. Hutchinson, president of our

visual communications surfaces division, which will become effective upon the
consummation of the merger. Each of the amendments provides the executive with a
one-time bonus payment equal to his annual base salary in the respective amounts
of $220,000, $208,000 and $208,000 within five days after the effective date of
the merger. As a result of these amendments, if the merger is completed, these
executives will not be entitled to some benefits that might otherwise have been
provided under the terms of their respective employment agreements as currently
in effect.

             SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

         The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial
ownership of PolyVision's common stock, as of September 10, 2001, by

         o    each person known by PolyVision to be the beneficial owner of more
              than 5% of the outstanding common stock,

         o    each of PolyVision's directors and executive officers, and

         o    all directors and executive officers of PolyVision as a group.

         Except as otherwise noted, each person listed in the table below has
sole voting and sole investment power with respect to the number of shares of
common stock set forth opposite his or its name. Beneficial ownership as set
forth in this table includes presently exercisable options and those options
exercisable within 60 days to purchase shares of PolyVision common stock.

Dividend Policy

         PolyVision has never declared or paid dividends on its common stock and
does not expect to pay dividends on its common stock at any time in the
foreseeable future. The terms of PolyVision's senior credit facilities prohibit
the payment of common stock dividends. The terms of PolyVision's series B,
series C and series D preferred stock prohibit PolyVision from paying dividends
on all classes of stock junior to such stock, including the common stock, while
shares of PolyVision's series B, series C and series D preferred stock remain
outstanding. In addition, the merger agreement prohibits, prior to the effective
time of the merger, the payment of any dividends with respect to PolyVision's
common stock without Steelcase's prior consent.

become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
share so converted, and all such shares of Surviving Corporation common stock
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time.

      Section 3.2 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C
Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder that has the right to receive payment of
the fair value of such holder's shares pursuant to Section 910 of the BCL and
has complied with the provisions of Section 623 of the BCL ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Series B Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration, Series C Preferred Stock Merger Consideration or Series D
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable, unless such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal. If
after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses such
holder's right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Series B
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, Series C Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration or Series D Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as applicable.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

      Section 3.3  Exchange of Certificates.

            (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate an agent, which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"Paying Agent"), for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock (the
"Shares") in connection with the Merger and to receive the funds to which
holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall make available to the Paying Agent
the aggregate of the Common Stock Merger Consideration, Series B Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration, Series C Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and Series D
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration payable with respect to Shares to be
converted pursuant to Section 3.1 ("Merger Consideration"). Such funds shall be
held by the Paying Agent in a separate account established for the benefit of
holders of Shares and may be invested by the Paying Agent in obligations of or

                                      A-11

guaranteed by the United States government or in other investment-grade debt
instruments pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
Shares. Earnings on such funds shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue
to the benefit of holders of Shares.

            (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares that
were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only
upon delivery to the Paying Agent of the certificates evidencing ownership
thereof (the "Certificates") and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person (as hereinafter defined) other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition precedent to the making of such payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other Taxes (as hereinafter defined) required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or
is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.3, each Certificate shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon.

            (c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the
Effective Time, the share records of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article III.

            (d) Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following six
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be

                                      A-12

liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

      Section 3.4 Adjustment of Merger Consideration. The parties understand and
agree that the per-share Merger Consideration has been calculated based upon the
accuracy of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.3 and that,
in the event the number of outstanding Company shares or Company shares issuable
upon the conversion of securities or the exercise of options or other agreements
exceeds the amounts specifically set forth in Section 4.3 (including as a result
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into stock or stock equivalent of the
Company, recapitalization, or other like change occurring after the date of this
Agreement), the per-share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted
downward. The provisions of this Section 3.4 shall not, however, affect the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.3.

      Section 3.5 Stock Options.

            (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action,
including obtaining consents from holders of Options (as defined below),
necessary to cause each unexpired and unexercised stock option under the
PolyVision 2000 Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan, the PolyVision 1999
Stock Option Plan, the PolyVision 1994 Stock Option Plan and the Company's 1995
Directors Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Option Plans") or otherwise
granted by the Company other than pursuant to any of the Option Plans (each an
"Option"), whether vested or unvested, to be canceled immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In consideration for such cancellation, the holder of each such
Option shall receive at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time a cash payment from the Company equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess (if any) of (x) the Common Stock
Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share subject to such
Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

            (b) The Company shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to the Company Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by
each officer or director of the Company who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), with respect to shares of Company Common Stock to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. By adopting or
approving this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors shall be deemed to have
approved and authorized, and the shareholders of the Company shall be deemed to
have approved and ratified, each and every amendment to (and such other actions
in respect of) the Option Plans (and any other plan) and the agreements
evidencing awards under the Option Plans (and any other plan) as the officers of
the Company may deem necessary or appropriate to give effect to the provisions
of this Section 3.5.

      Section 3.6 Warrants. From and after the Effective Time, each of the
warrants of the Company to purchase Company Common Stock governed by the Warrant
Agreement, dated as of December 30, 1998, among the Company, John Hancock Mutual
Life Insurance Company, John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company and Hancock
Mezzanine Partners, L.P.

                                      A-13

(collectively, the "Warrants") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, in accordance with the terms of such Warrant, represent
the right, upon exercise thereof and payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (as
defined in such Warrant), to receive in cash, without interest, a payment equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would
have been subject to issuance upon the exercise of such Warrant, had such
exercise occurred immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Common
Stock Merger Consideration, such cash payment to be reduced by any required
withholding of Taxes.

      Section 3.7 Convertible Note. From and after the Effective Time, the
Company's $8,000,000 10% convertible subordinated promissory note, dated
November 20, 1998, payable to Wind Point Partners III, L.P. (the "Convertible
Note") shall, in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Note, represent
the right, upon conversion thereof in accordance with its terms, to receive in
cash, without interest, a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of
such Convertible Note in accordance with its terms immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) the Common Stock Merger Consideration, such cash payment
to be reduced by any required withholding of Taxes.

      Section 3.8 Withholding Rights Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Article III such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being

Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Change" or

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (z) the Company's ability to consummate the

standing in each jurisdiction where the Company's ownership or leasing of

a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such jurisdiction is listed in Section
4.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

            (c) Complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Company, as amended to date (together, the "Company

owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or
by such party and one or more of its Subsidiaries or (ii) such party or any
other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding any such

ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business makes such
qualification or license necessary, except where the failure to have such

so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such jurisdiction is
listed in Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

            (c) Copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or
similar organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, as amended to date
(collectively, the "Subsidiary Organizational Documents"), have been delivered

such amendment, each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the
case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. As
of its filing date or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment,
each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

                                      A-19

state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each
Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the
date such registration statement or amendment became effective and as of the
date of any such supplement, did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. None of the Company
Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the
SEC. All of the audited financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents
(collectively, the "Financial Statements") (i) have been prepared from, are in
accordance with and accurately reflect the books and records of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries, (ii) comply in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto, (iii) have been prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein
or in the notes thereto and except, in the case of the unaudited interim
statements, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iv)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position and
the consolidated results of operations and cash flows (subject, in the case of
the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments and
any other adjustments described therein which were not and are not expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to be material in amount) of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the times and for the periods referred to
therein.

      Section 4.8 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as (i) contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) set forth in Section 4.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
since December 31, 2000 (the "Balance Sheet Date"), each of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary has conducted its respective business only in the ordinary
course of business and in a manner consistent with past practice in all material
respects. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the Balance

Company Subsidiary has:

            (a)   suffered any Company Material Adverse Change;

            (b) incurred any material liabilities or obligations (absolute,

            (c) paid, discharged or satisfied any material claim, liability or

in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the
Balance Sheet Date;

            (d) permitted or allowed any of its material properties or assets

of substantial value;

            (g) sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of any of its material
properties or assets (real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible), except
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

            (h) disposed of or permitted to lapse any rights to the use of any
material Intellectual Property, or disposed of or disclosed to any person other
than representatives of Parent any material trade secret, formula, process,
know-how or other material Business Intellectual Property not theretofore a
matter of public knowledge;

            (i) granted any general increase in the compensation or benefits of
officers or employees (including any such increase pursuant to any bonus,

Company Preferred Stock, provided that in no event shall any such dividend have
accrued or become payable at a rate in excess of (A) $4.00 per share at an
annual rate in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock and (B) $4.50 per share
at an annual rate in the case of the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C
Preferred Stock, and provided further that the record date for any such dividend

dividend is payable, or redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired, directly or
indirectly, any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary;

            (l) made any change in any of the accounting methods used by it
materially affecting its assets, liabilities or business, except for such

below);

            (m) paid, loaned or advanced any amount to, or sold, transferred or

agreement or arrangement with, any of its officers or directors or any affiliate
or associate of any of its officers or directors except for directors' fees, and
compensation to officers at rates not exceeding the rates of compensation paid
during the year 2001; or

            (n) agreed, whether in writing or otherwise, to take any action
described in this Section 4.8.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Encumbrance" means any lien, charge,
security interest, option, claim, mortgage, pledge, or other encumbrance or
restriction of any nature whatsoever, provided, however, that the term
Encumbrance shall not include any lien for Taxes not then due and payable,
statutory lien or lien not materially interfering with the use or value of the
property subject to such lien.

      Section 4.9 No Undisclosed Liabilities; Indebtedness. Except (i) as
disclosed in the Financial Statements as of the Balance Sheet Date, (ii) as
disclosed in any Company SEC Documents dated or filed with the SEC since the
Balance Sheet Date or (iii) as disclosed in Section 4.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
material liabilities or obligations of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Company had outstanding indebtedness, comprising all
liabilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis,
whether primary or secondary or absolute or contingent (including indebtedness
for borrowed money; indebtedness evidenced by notes, bonds, debentures or
similar instruments; capital lease obligations; and indebtedness secured by
liens on any assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary), of $103,700,000.
Section 4.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date
hereof, the amount of the principal and unpaid interest outstanding under each
instrument evidencing any indebtedness which will accelerate or become due or
which provides for a right of redemption or repurchase on the part of the holder
of such indebtedness (with or without due notice or lapse of time) as a result
of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for any such instruments which
individually and in the aggregate, evidence an immaterial amount of such
indebtedness.

      Section 4.10  Litigation.  Except  as set forth in  Section  4.10 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule:

            (a) (i) there is no material action, suit, claim (including any
worker's compensation claim), litigation or other proceeding (including
arbitration proceeding or alternative dispute resolution proceeding) or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
naming as a party thereto, and there is no action, suit, claim (including
arbitration proceeding or alternative dispute resolution proceeding) or
investigation materially affecting, (A) the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
(B) to the knowledge of the Company, any of the Company's or any Company
Subsidiary's current or former directors or officers, in such capacities, or any
other Person who may be entitled to indemnification by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection therewith, and (ii) the Company does not know
or have any reason to know of any valid basis for any such suit, claim, action
or proceeding; and

            (b) there is no outstanding or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened material order, judgment, injunction, award or decree of any
Governmental Entity against (i) the

                                      A-22

Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties, assets or
businesses or (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, any of the Company's or any
Company Subsidiary's current or former directors or officers, in such
capacities, or any other Person who may be entitled to indemnification by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection therewith.

      Section 4.11  Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.

            (a) Section 4.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
true and complete list of each employment, bonus, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, restricted stock, performance unit, phantom stock,
dental, health, accident, life, accidental death and dismemberment, fringe,
cafeteria, scholarship, flexible spending arrangement or reimbursement, group
legal services, long term care, dependent care, vacation, paid time off, sick
leave, educational assistance, wellness, employee assistance program, adoption
assistance, vision, voluntary employees beneficiary association, other
insurance, stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation right or other
stock-based incentive, severance, change-in-control, or termination pay,
hospitalization or other medical, disability, life or other insurance,
supplemental unemployment benefits, profit-sharing, pension, or retirement plan,
program, agreement or arrangement and each other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required to
be contributed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or by any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that together with
the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be deemed a "single employer" within
the meaning of section 4001(b)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), for the benefit of any current or former employee
or director of the Company, or any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate,
whether formal or informal and with respect to which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate may have any liabilities or obligations (the "Plans"). Section 4.11(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule separately identifies each of the Plans that
is an "employee welfare benefit plan," or "employee pension benefit plan" as
such terms are defined, respectively, in sections 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA (such
plans being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "ERISA Plans").

            (b) Except as disclosed in Section 4.11(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, with respect to each of the Plans, the Company has heretofore
delivered to Parent true and complete copies of each of the following documents,
as applicable:

                  (i)   the Plan  (including all amendments  thereto) for each
            written  Plan or a  written  description  of any Plan  that is not
            otherwise in writing;

                  (ii) the annual report on Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"")
            Form 5500 Series, if required under ERISA or the Internal Revenue
            Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code""), with respect to each Plan
            for the last three plan years ending prior to the date of this
            Agreement for which such a report was filed;

                  (iii) the actuarial report, if required under ERISA, with
            respect to each ERISA Plan for the last three plan years ending
            prior to the date of this Agreement;

                                      A-23

                  (iv) the most recent Summary Plan Description, together with
            all Summary of Material Modifications issued with respect to such
            Summary Plan Description, if required under ERISA, with respect to
            each ERISA Plan, and all other material employee communications
            relating to each ERISA Plan;

                  (v) if the Plan is funded through a trust or any other funding
            vehicle, the trust or other funding agreement (including all
            amendments thereto) and the latest financial statements thereof, if
            any;

                  (vi) all contracts relating to the Plans with respect to which
            the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate may have
            any liability, including insurance contracts, investment management
            agreements, subscription and participation agreements and record
            keeping agreements; and

                  (vii) the most recent determination letter received from the
            IRS with respect to each Plan that is intended to be qualified under
            section 401(a) of the Code.

            (c) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate since the effective date
of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the Company's knowledge,
no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any liability under such Title,
other than liability for premiums due to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC"), which payments have been or will be made when due. Insofar
as the representation made in this Section 4.11(c) applies to section 4064, 4069
or 4204 of ERISA, it is made with respect to any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make,
contributions during the six-year period ending on the last day of the most
recent plan year ended before the date of this Agreement. The PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any Plan and no condition exists that
presents a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted.

            (d) With respect to each of the ERISA Plans that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA (a "Title IV Plan"), the present value of projected benefit
obligations under such Plan, as determined by the Plan's actuary based upon the
actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial
report prepared by such Plan's actuary with respect to such Plan, did not, as of
its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such
Plan allocable to such projected benefit obligations.

            (e) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any ERISA
Affiliate, any of the Plans, any trust created thereunder, nor to the Company's
knowledge, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction or
has taken or failed to take any action in connection with which the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate could be subject to any material
liability for either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 409 or 502(i)
of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to section 4975, 4976 or 4980B of the Code.

                                      A-24

            (f) All contributions and premiums required to be paid under the
terms of each of the ERISA Plans and section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of the
Code, have, to the extent due, been paid in full or properly recorded on the
financial statements or records of the Company or a Company Subsidiary. No Plan
or any trust established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in section 302 of ERISA or section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived.

            (g) With respect to any Title IV Plan that is a "multiemployer
pension plan," as such term is defined in section 3(37) of ERISA, (i) neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, since May 11, 1987, made or suffered a
"complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms are respectively
defined in sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, (ii) no event has occurred that
presents a material risk of such a complete or partial withdrawal, and neither
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has been assessed any withdrawal liability,
(iii) neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any contingent liability
under section 4204 of ERISA, (iv) no circumstances exist that present a material
risk that any such Plan will go into reorganization and (v) to the knowledge of
the Company, there is no unfunded liability with respect to the Company's
participation in any such Plan. The Company has no liability or other obligation
under any such Plan other than the liability to make contributions in respect of
benefit liabilities arising in the ordinary and ongoing course of business. If
any Title IV Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate would have any aggregate withdrawal liability if a complete
withdrawal by the Company and the ERISA Affiliates were to occur under each such
Plan on the date hereof.

            (h)   No Plan is described in section 4063(a) of ERISA.

            (i) Except as disclosed in Section 4.11(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, each of the Plans has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with applicable laws, including but not limited to ERISA
and the Code.

            (j) Each of the ERISA Plans that is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified or may be
retroactively amended within the remedial amendment period under Section 401(b)
of the Code to be so qualified. Except as disclosed in Section 4.11(j) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has applied for and received a
currently effective determination letter from the IRS stating that it is so
qualified, and no event has occurred which would affect such qualified status.
With respect to each ERISA Plan set forth in Section 4.11(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company has set forth in Section 4.11(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule the reasons for any potential failure of such ERISA Plan to
be so qualified.

            (k) Any Plan that is intended to satisfy the requirements of section
501(c)(9) of the Code has so satisfied such requirements.

            (l) Except as disclosed in Section 4.11(l) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no amounts payable (individually or collectively and whether in cash,
capital stock of the Company or other property) under any of the Plans or any
other contract, agreement or arrangement with respect to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary may have any liability will, as a direct or indirect
result of the Transactions, fail to be deductible for federal

                                      A-25

income tax purposes by virtue of section 162(m) or section 280G of the Code or,
to the knowledge of the Company, section 162(a) of the Code.

            (m) No Plan provides benefits, including without limitation death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees after retirement or other termination of service (other than (i)
coverage mandated by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985,
as amended, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee
pension plan," as that term is defined in section 3(2) of ERISA, (iii) benefits
the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or his or her
beneficiary) or (iv) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on
the books of the Company or a Company Subsidiary).

            (n) Except as disclosed in Section 4.11(n) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, either alone or in combination with any other event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other similar termination payment, or (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of, or otherwise enhance, any
benefit due to any such employee, officer, director or consultant.

            (o) There are no pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary under any such Plan or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits).

            (p) Except as disclosed in Section 4.11(p) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or as expressly permitted by this Agreement, since December 31, 2000,
there has not been (i) any acceleration, amendment or change of the period of
exercisability or vesting of any options or restricted stock, stock bonus or
other awards under any Option Plan (including any discretionary acceleration of
the exercise periods or vesting by the Company Board of Directors or any
committee thereof or any other persons administering an Option Plan) or
authorization of cash payments in exchange for any Options, restricted stock,
stock bonus or other awards granted under any of such Option Plans or (ii) any
adoption or amendment by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any collective
bargaining agreement or Plan. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor
any ERISA Affiliate has any formal plan or commitment to create any additional
Plan or modify or change any existing Plan that would affect any current or
former employee or director of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate.

            (q) Except with respect to changes required by law, there has been
no adoption of, amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or
not written) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of the expense
incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2000.

            (r) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to any
agreement or understanding, whether written or unwritten, with the PBGC, the
IRS, the Department of Labor or the Health Care Financing Administration.

                                      A-26

            (s) No representations or communications, oral or written, with
respect to the participation, eligibility for benefits, vesting, benefit accrual
or coverage under any Plan have been made to employees, directors or agents (or
any of their representatives or beneficiaries) of the Company which are not in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plans.

            (t) No "leased employee," as that term is defined in section 414(n)
of the Code, performs services for the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. Neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) used the services or workers
provided by third party contract labor suppliers, temporary employees, "leased
employees," or individuals who have provided services as independent
contractors, and who may have become eligible to participate in the Plans or
(ii) used the services of individuals to an extent that would reasonably be
expected to result in the disqualification of any of the Plans or the imposition
of penalties or excise taxes with respect to the Plans by the IRS, the
Department of Labor, the PBGC, or any other Governmental Entity.

            (u) With respect to each Plan established or maintained outside of
the United States of America primarily for benefit of employees of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary residing outside the United States of America (a
"Foreign Benefit Plan"): (i) all employer and employee contributions to each
Foreign Benefit Plan required by law or by the terms of such Foreign Benefit
Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued, in accordance with normal
accounting practices; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded
Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan
funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Benefit
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with
respect to all current and former participants in such plan according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan and no transaction contemplated by
this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations; and (iii) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be
registered has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable regulatory authorities.

      Section 4.12      Taxes.  Except  as set  forth in  Section  4.12 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule:

            (a) the Company and each Company Subsidiary has duly and timely
filed (or there has been duly and timely filed on its behalf), or a valid
extension of time to file has been obtained, with the appropriate governmental
authorities all Tax Returns (as hereinafter defined) required to be filed by it
and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material
respects, and (ii) all Taxes for which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may
be liable (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) in respect of periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or before the Effective Time have been timely paid,
or will be timely paid, or have been provided for on the Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP. With respect to any period (or portion thereof) through
the Effective Time for which Taxes are not yet due or owing, the Company and
each Company Subsidiary has established due and sufficient reserves for the
payments of such Taxes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and such current reserves through the Effective Time are duly and
fully provided for in the Financial Statements;

                                      A-27

            (b) no deficiencies for Taxes have been claimed, proposed or
assessed by any taxing or other governmental authority against the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
received any notice, or otherwise has any knowledge, of any potential claim,
proposal or assessment against the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any
such deficiency for Taxes. There are no pending, or to the best of the Company's
or any Company Subsidiary's knowledge, threatened audits, investigations or
claims for or relating to any liability in respect of Taxes, and there are no
matters under discussion with respect to Taxes between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary on the one hand, and any governmental authority on the other
hand, that are likely to result in a material additional liability of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for Taxes;

            (c) there are no liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable, and for which adequate reserves have been provided for on the Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP;

            (d) the Company and each Company Subsidiary has duly and timely
withheld, collected, deposited and paid to the proper governmental authority all
Taxes required to have been withheld, collected, deposited or paid;

            (e) no claim has ever been made to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or Company
Subsidiary has not filed Tax Returns that the Company or such Company Subsidiary
is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction;

            (f) there are no consents, agreements, grants or requests for the
extension or waiver of any statutes of limitations applicable to any Taxes for
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is or may be liable;

binding and in full force and effect would not, individually or in the

occupied or used, the basis of which has not been cured.

            (e) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company's and/or the
Company Subsidiaries' use and operation of the Real Property as presently
conducted is not dependent on a nonconforming use or other waiver from a

Real Property or the operations thereon as presently conducted (unless such
waiver has in fact been granted).

consents and approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized and existing or to have such power, authority, and governmental

be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, impair in any material respect
the ability of each of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, or prevent or

                                      A-39

require any material filing by Parent or Merger Sub with, or permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity (except for (i)

cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any material note, bond, mortgage, lien, indenture, lease, license, contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party or by which either of them or any of their respective properties or assets
may be bound or (d) violate any material order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (b),
(c) and (d) for any failures to make such filings and failures to obtain such
permits, authorizations, consents or approvals and any such violations, breaches
or defaults which would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, impair in any material respect the ability of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, as the case may be, to perform its obligations under this Agreement,
or prevent or materially delay the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the
Transactions.

            (a) The Company agrees that it shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any
Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request the return of all
information provided to any third party pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
or otherwise in connection with such discussions, negotiations or
communications. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of termination
of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company shall not and shall not
authorize or permit its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, affiliates or other agents (collectively,
"Representatives") to directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, encourage,
or take any action to facilitate the making of, any offer or proposal which
constitutes or which may be reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) in the event of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal for the
Company, engage in any negotiations or discussions with, or provide any
information or data to, any Person (other than Parent or any of its affiliates
or representatives) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section
6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company
Board of Directors (or the Special Committee) from (1) in the event of an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, requesting all such information from and
having such discussions with any Person in connection therewith as may be
necessary for the Company Board of Directors (and the Special Committee) to
inform themselves fully as to all material terms and conditions (including the
price, structure, intended accounting and tax treatment, closing conditions,
anticipated closing date, likelihood of consummation, creditworthiness of the
intended purchaser and requisite regulatory approvals) of such Acquisition
Proposal and providing all such material, non-public information or data with
respect to the Company to such Person if (A) prior to providing such information
or data and having any such discussions, the Company Board of Directors receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement having provisions that
are customary in such agreements relative to proposed transactions such as the
Acquisition Proposal, as advised by outside legal counsel, and otherwise
containing terms and provisions no less restrictive than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) the Company Board of Directors (and the
Special Committee) shall have determined, in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action, provide such
information or data or have discussions for the purpose of becoming so fully
informed would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
provided that, after having determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that each of the Company Board of Directors and the
Special Committee is fully informed with respect to the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the proponent thereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Representatives shall be permitted

                                      A-45

to engage in any discussions with such Person that would violate this Section
6.3, or (2) (i) withdrawing, modifying, or qualifying (or publicly proposing to
withdraw, modify, or qualify) the recommendation by the Company Board of
Directors (and the Special Committee) to the Company's shareholders to vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement; provided that the Company Board of
Directors (and the Special Committee) shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, or (ii)
making such other disclosure to the Company's shareholders as in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board of Directors (and the Special Committee), after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is necessary under applicable law.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

      Section 7.1       Special  Meeting;   Proxy  Statement;   Adoption  of
Agreement.

            (a)   The Company shall:

                  (i) as promptly as practicable following the execution and
            delivery of this Agreement, establish a record date in accordance
            with the Company Organizational Documents and the BCL (the "Record
            Date") and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
            meeting of the Company's shareholders (together with all
            adjournments or postponements thereof, the "Special Meeting") as
            soon as practicable after the date hereof for the purpose of
            considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the Merger;

                  (ii) as promptly as practicable following the date hereof,
            prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a preliminary Proxy
            Statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the Company's
            shareholders at the Special Meeting. The Company shall use its
            reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement "cleared" by the
            SEC's staff and, as promptly as practicable thereafter, cause the
            Proxy Statement, in definitive form, to be mailed to the Company's
            shareholders in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Exchange
            Act, the Company Organizational Documents and the BCL. As promptly
            as practicable after receipt thereof, the Company shall provide
            Parent with copies of all written comments and advise Parent of any
            oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the
            SEC's staff. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
            opportunity to review and comment on all proposed amendments and
            supplements to the Proxy Statement prior to filing the same with the
            SEC, and will provide Parent with a true and complete copy of all
            such filings made with the SEC;

                  (iii) include in the Proxy Statement (A) the opinion of the
            Financial Advisor referred to in Section 4.24 and (B) the
            recommendation of the Company Board of Directors (and the Special
            Committee) that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the
            adoption of this Agreement (the "Company

                                      A-46

            Recommendation"), unless, in the case of the foregoing clause (B),
            in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors (and
            the Special Committee), after consultation with outside legal
            counsel, the inclusion of the Company Recommendation would be
            inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

                  (iv) use all reasonable efforts to solicit from shareholders
            proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and take all
            actions reasonably necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of
            Parent, advisable to secure the approval of shareholders required by
            the BCL, the Company Organizational Documents and any other
            applicable law to effect the Merger.

            (b) Parent shall furnish all information concerning it as may
reasonably be requested by the Company in connection with the actions required
to be taken by the Company under Section 7.1(a)(ii) and the preparation and
filing of the Proxy Statement and shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Proxy Statement "cleared" by the SEC's staff. Parent shall vote any shares
of the Company beneficially owned by it, or with respect to which it has the
power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to vote or cause to be voted, in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger at the Special
Meeting.

      Section 7.2  Reasonable Best Efforts; Consents and Approvals.

            (a) Each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable best
efforts to obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers, consents and
approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and filings, and to use all
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions;
provided that nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall require any party to
waive or exercise any right hereunder which is waivable or exercisable in the
sole discretion of such party.

            (b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all
reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on it with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions
(which actions shall include, without limitation, furnishing all information
required under the HSR Act or any comparable laws of foreign jurisdictions and
in connection with approvals of, filings with and inquiries or requests from any
Governmental Entity); shall promptly cooperate with and, subject to such
confidentiality agreements as may be reasonably necessary or requested, furnish
information to each other or their counsel in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions; and shall not take any action that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in
not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental Entity
necessary to be obtained prior to Closing. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and shall cause respective Subsidiaries to, take all
reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and shall cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity or other public or private third party required to
be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any
action contemplated thereby or by this

                                      A-47

Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other covenant herein
contained, in connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals under the
HSR Act or any comparable laws of foreign jurisdictions, neither Parent nor the
Company shall be required to divest or hold separate or otherwise take or commit
to take any action that limits Parent's or the Company's freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain, the Company or any portions thereof or
any of the businesses, product lines, properties or assets of the Company or
Parent.

            (c) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the
other parties hereto with respect to, provide any necessary information with
respect to, and provide the other (or its counsel) copies of, all filings made
by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by
such party to a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions
unless otherwise prohibited by law. If any party hereto or affiliate thereof
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
such Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, then such party shall
endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response
in compliance with such request. To the extent that transfers, amendments or
modifications of permits (including environmental permits) are required as a
result of the execution of this Agreement or consummation of the Transactions,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such
transfers.

      Section 7.3 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any
material failure of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the representations or
warranties of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereto.

      Section 7.4 Access; Confidentiality. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and subject to the terms of the Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 8, 2000, between Parent and the Company
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company shall (and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to) afford the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financing sources and other representatives of Parent and Merger Sub reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to all of its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records (including but not limited to Tax Returns).
Without limitation as to the foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Company
shall (and shall cause each Company subsidiary to) afford Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective representatives such access to any site located on the Real
Property as may reasonably be requested by Parent or Merger Sub for the purpose
of conducting Phase I environmental assessments. During the period from the date
hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent and Merger Sub all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or
Merger Sub may reasonably request, including a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws.

                                      A-48

      Section 7.5 Publicity. Each of Parent and the Company shall consult with
the other and agree upon the initial press release with respect to the execution
of this Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue any
press release or other announcement with respect to any of the Transactions or
this Agreement (including pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act)
without the prior consultation of the other party, except as such party
believes, after consultation with outside counsel, may be required by law, by
any listing agreement with or listing rules of a national securities exchange or
by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market or any U.S. inter-dealer quotation
system of a registered national securities association, provided, however, that
each party shall provide, to the extent practicable, notice to and shall consult
with the other party prior to issuing any such press release or other
announcement.

      Section 7.6 Insurance and Indemnification. (a) Parent agrees that all
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions of
directors occurring prior to the Effective Time in connection with the adoption
of this Agreement and the approval of the Transactions) now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, and their respective heirs and representatives (each an
"Indemnified Party"), provided in the Company Organizational Documents or
Subsidiary Organizational Documents and any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or as to the fullest
extent permitted by law shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six years
following the Effective Time. Parent shall cause to be included and to be
maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporation's (or any successor's)
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, during such six-year period following
the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers and directors and advancement of expenses which are,
in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the
corresponding provisions contained in the Company Organizational Documents.

            (b) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Company's
existing officers' and directors' liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") for a
period of not less than three years after the Effective Time; provided, however,
that Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent
coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable to such former directors
or officers; provided further, that if the existing D&O Insurance expires or is
terminated or cancelled during such period, then Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain substantially similar
D&O Insurance or, if not obtainable, Parent shall obtain as much D&O Insurance
as can be obtained for an annual premium not in excess of 200% of the average of
the premiums paid by the Company in 1998, 1999 and 2000 for D&O Insurance (the
"Average Premium"); provided further, however, that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this Section 7.6(b) in
excess of 200% of the Average Premium; and provided, further, that if Parent or
the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the amount of insurance required
by this Section 7.6(b) for such annual premium, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain as much insurance as can be obtained for an annual
premium not in excess of 200% of the Average Premium. The premium for D&O
Insurance for the 12-month period ending May 2002 is set forth on Section 7.6(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

                                      A-49

      Section 7.7  Determination Letters; Multiemployer Plans.

            (a) As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, with respect to each ERISA Plan set forth on Schedule 4.11(j)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall apply (but in no event
later than the expiration of the remedial amendment period for such ERISA Plan
under Section 401(b) of the Code) for a determination letter from the IRS
stating that such ERISA Plan is qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code.

            (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a letter from the board of trustees of each Plan that is a multiemployer plan
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, dated not more than thirty (30)
days before the date of this Agreement, to the effect that there is no unfunded
liability with respect to the Company's participation in such Plan and stating
that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary would have any withdrawal
liability upon a "complete withdrawal" from such plan (within the meaning of
Section 4203 of ERISA) if such withdrawal occurred as of the date of such
letter.

      Section 7.8 Employment and Benefit Arrangements.

            (a) For a one-year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to provide those employees of the
Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time (the "Employees"), so long as they
remain employees of the Surviving Corporation, with benefits that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable to such Employees as are the benefits of the
Company provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
foregoing sentence shall not apply to severance benefits, and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to maintain any particular level of severance
benefits.

            (b) For purposes of vesting and eligibility, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, with respect to each benefit required to be
provided under the terms of this Section 7.8, credit each Employee with all
service credited to such Employee under the Company's corresponding plan,
policy, program or arrangement applicable to such Employee as of the Effective
Time.

            (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall credit each Employee
with any vacation and sick days accrued as of the Effective Time in accordance
with the terms of the Company's vacation and sick day policies in effect as of
such date.

            (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, waive any pre-existing condition limitations and
credit any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses that are applicable and/or
covered under the Benefit Plans providing health and dental and similar benefits
and are incurred by the Employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of
the calendar year prior to participation (if applicable) in the benefit plans
provided by Parent or the Subsidiaries of Parent (other than the Surviving
Corporation).

            (e) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are not intended to create
rights of third party beneficiaries.

                                      A-50

            (f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
nothing in this Section 7.8 shall be deemed to be a commitment on the part of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide employment to any person for any
period of time and, except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.8, nothing
herein shall be deemed to prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with its
terms.

      Section 7.9 Transfer of Certain Intellectual Property. The Company shall
use its best efforts to cause all right, title and interest to any Intellectual
Property listed in Section 4.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for which
the Company or a Company Subsidiary is not listed as the record owner or which
is subject to an Encumbrance (other than an Encumbrance pursuant to an agreement
referenced in Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) to be
assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered, free and clear of such
Encumbrances, to Parent, a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or a
Company Subsidiary and to cause such right, title and interest to be vested in
Parent, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, at the Effective
Time.

      Section 7.10 Third Party Standstill Agreements. During the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall enforce and
shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any standstill provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement between the Company and other parties
entered into prior to the date hereof.

      Section 7.11 Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to any of the Transactions or to the Company, then the Company
and the Company Board of Directors shall use all reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

decree or injunction vacated.

            (e) The Shareholder's Agreement shall be in full force and effect
and the Shareholder shall be in compliance with the terms thereof.

            9.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose failure to

then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account as Parent may designate in writing to the Company), on the
second business day next following the date such definitive agreement is
executed and delivered, $2,650,000 in cash. It is expressly agreed that the
amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), if any, constitute
liquidated damages negotiated at arm's length and do not constitute, and are not
intended by the parties to operate as, a penalty.

      Section 10.5 Interpretation. All terms defined in this Agreement shall
have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or
delivered pursuant hereto unless specifically otherwise defined therein. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as the feminine
and neutral genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined
or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including in the case of agreements or instruments by
waiver or consent, and in the case of statutes, by comparable successor
statutes, and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. Each of the parties hereto has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement such that if any ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if it was drafted
by all of the parties hereto, collectively, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship
of any of the provisions of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules such reference shall be
to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The , index of defined terms and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the intended meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." As used in
this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule
12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

      Section 10.6 Jurisdiction. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby expressly and irrevocably submits, with respect to any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York and to the jurisdiction of
any other competent court of the State of New York (collectively, the "New York
Courts"), preserving, however, all rights of removal to such federal court under
28 U.S.C. Section 1441, in connection with all disputes arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions and agrees not to commence
any litigation relating to the foregoing except in such courts. Each such party
hereby waives the right to any other jurisdiction or venue for any litigation
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions to which
any of them may be entitled by reason of its present or future domicile.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such party agrees that each of the other
parties shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement
of a judgment entered by the New York Courts in any other court or jurisdiction.

      Section 10.7 Service of Process. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in Section 10.6 hereof in any legal
action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified U.S. mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or
pursuant to Section 10.4 hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the
right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other
legally available method.

                                      A-58

      Section 10.8 Specific Performance. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this
Agreement, each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed
and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to
any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel
specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted in accordance
with Section 10.6 hereof.

      Section 10.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a
counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other parties.

      Section 10.10     Entire Agreement; No Third-Party  Beneficiaries.  This
Agreement, the Shareholder's Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement:

            (a) constitute the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
(provided that the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede any conflicting
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement), and

            (b) except as provided in Section 7.6, are not intended to confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

      Section 10.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

      Section 10.12 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal (procedural and substantive) laws of
the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

      Section 10.13 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of
the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign any or
all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Parent, one or more
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination
thereof. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties anpermitted assigns.

      Section 10.14 Special Committee Enforcement. Until the Effective Time, all
action to be taken by the Company to enforce, waive compliance with or amend or
modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall require the approval of
the Special Committee.

                            [Signature page follows.]

                                      A-59

this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized as of the date first written above.

Owned by the Shareholder, whether owned on the date hereof or hereafter
acquired, (i) in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement, all transactions
contemplated thereby, and any actions required in furtherance thereof and
hereof; (ii) against any action or agreement that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, or prevent the Merger or
result in a breach in any material respect of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries under the Merger Agreement; and (iii) except as specifically
requested in writing in advance by Parent, against any of the following actions
(other than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement) that are submitted to a vote of the holders of the Shares: (A) any
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) any
sale, lease, transfer or disposition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of any assets which in the aggregate are material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or a reorganization, recapitalization,
dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (C)(1) any
change in the present capitalization of the Company or any amendment of the
Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws; (2) any other material change
in the corporate structure or business of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries; or (3) any other action or agreement that is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with or prevent the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

      As used in this Agreement, the term "Beneficially Own" or "Beneficial
Ownership" with respect to any securities means having "beneficial ownership" of
such securities as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act,
including pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or
not in writing, except that the term shall not include Shares which the
Shareholder has the right to acquire under any options to acquire Shares from
the Company ("Company Stock Options") unless such Shares have been acquired upon
exercise of such Company Stock Options.

            (b) Effective immediately upon the execution of this Agreement, and
in order to secure its obligations hereunder, the Shareholder hereby grants to,
and appoints Parent and any designee of Parent, and each of them individually,
with full power of substitution and resubstitution, the Shareholder's true and
lawful irrevocable (until the Voting Expiration Time) proxy to vote the
Shareholder's Shares, or grant a consent or approval in respect of the
Shareholder's Shares, solely on such matters and as indicated in Section 1(a)
above. The Shareholder (i) agrees to take such further action and execute such
other instruments as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of
this proxy, (ii) hereby represents that any proxy heretofore given in respect of
the Shareholder's Shares is not irrevocable, and (iii) hereby revokes any proxy
previously granted by the Shareholder with respect to its Shares. The
Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Parent and Merger Sub are entering
into the Merger Agreement in

                                      B-2

reliance on the Shareholder's execution and delivery of this irrevocable proxy.
The Shareholder hereby affirms that this irrevocable proxy is given in
connection with the execution of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and
further affirms that this irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest in this
Agreement for the term stated herein and may under no circumstances be revoked
prior to the Voting Expiration Time. This proxy is executed and intended to be
irrevocable for the above-stated term in accordance with the provisions of
Section 609 of the BCL.

      Section 2. Grant of Option. (a) Subject to the terms of this Section 2,
the Shareholder hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option
(the "Option") to purchase for cash all, but not less than all, of the Shares
held of record or Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder at a purchase price per
Share equal to the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the Series B Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration, or the Series C Preferred Stock Merger Consideration
(in each case, as applicable, the "Per Share Amount").

            (b) Parent (or Merger Sub) may exercise the Option at any time from
and after any termination of the Merger Agreement and prior to 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern time, on the 30th day after the date of such termination (the "Option
Expiration Time").

            (c) To exercise the Option, Parent (or Merger Sub) shall give
written notice (the "Notice") to the Shareholder specifying the time for the
closing (the "Option Closing") of such purchase. The Option Closing shall be
held at the office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP on the date that
is 10 business days after the date of the Notice, subject to the satisfaction of
each of the conditions set forth in Section 2(d) below, or such other date as
may be agreed to by the Shareholder and Parent.

            (d) The occurrence of the Option Closing shall be subject to the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

                  (i) to the extent necessary, any applicable waiting periods
            (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act with respect to the
            purchase of the Shareholder's Shares following the exercise of the
            Option shall have expired or been terminated; and

                  (ii) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
            decree or ruling issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, and
            no statute, law, rule or regulation enacted or promulgated by any
            Governmental Entity, prohibiting the exercise of the Option or the
            delivery of the Shareholder's Shares pursuant thereto shall be in
            effect.

            (e) If Parent exercises the Option, Parent may sell or transfer the
Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option at any time, without the consent of
the Shareholder, to Merger Sub; provided, however, that no such sale or transfer
shall relieve Parent of its liabilities and obligations hereunder, including the
obligation to pay the consideration described in Section 2(a) and to comply with
Section 10.

                                      B-3

            (f) At the Option Closing, (i) Parent (or Merger Sub) shall pay, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Shareholder, an amount (the "Option Exercise Price") equal to the sum of (A) the
product of (x) the applicable Per Share Amount and (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock delivered at the Option Closing, (B) the product of (x) the
applicable Per Share Amount and (y) the number of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock delivered at the Option Closing and (C) the product of (x) the applicable
Per Share Amount and (y) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock
delivered at the Option Closing; and (ii) the Shareholder shall deliver or shall
cause to be delivered to Parent (or Merger Sub) a certificate or certificates
evidencing the Shareholder's Shares, and the Shareholder agrees that such Shares
shall be transferred free and clear of all liens. All such certificates
representing such Shares shall be duly endorsed in blank, or with appropriate
stock powers, duly executed in blank, attached thereto, in proper form for
transfer, and with all applicable taxes paid or provided for, subject to Section
15(i).

      Section 3. After-Acquired Shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any Shares acquired by the Shareholder after the date hereof, whether
by purchase or exchange, shall be subject to all of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Shareholder contained herein. In the
event of a share dividend or distribution, or any change in the Shares by reason
of any share dividend, split-up, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or the like, the term "Shares" shall be deemed to refer to and include
the Shares as well as all such share dividends and distributions and any shares
into which or for which any or all of the Shares may be changed or exchanged.

      Section 4. Other Covenants, Agreements, Representations and Warranties.
The Shareholder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Parent and Merger
Sub as of the date hereof and as of the Option Closing as follows:

security interests, mortgages or other encumbrances, and such Shares are not
subject to any rights of first refusal, put rights, other rights to purchase or

the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly
and validly authorized by the Shareholder's board of directors, and no other
corporate action on the part of the Shareholder is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by the Shareholder of this Agreement and the consummation
by it of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Shareholder and, assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Sub, is a
valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder enforceable against the
Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and
(ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

            (d) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
by the Shareholder, the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions

of this Agreement will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or the by-laws of the Shareholder,
(ii) require any filing by the Shareholder with, or permit, authorization,
consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity (except for (A) the filing with
the SEC of such reports and statements under the Exchange Act as may be required

of any material note, bond, mortgage, lien, indenture, lease, license, contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Shareholder or any of
its Subsidiaries (which, for the avoidance of any doubt, does not include the
Company and its Subsidiaries) is a party or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except for those as to which any
required consents, approvals or waivers have been obtained or (iv) violate any
material order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable
to the Shareholder, any of its Subsidiaries (which, for the avoidance of any
doubt, does not include the Company and its Subsidiaries) or any of their
respective properties or assets. The consummation of the Merger will not
conflict with or result in any breach of any of the terms of the Series B
Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock.

            (e) No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of the Shareholder.

any non-public information to any Person or group (other than Parent and Merger
Sub or any designees or Parent and Merger Sub) concerning any Acquisition
Proposal. In addition, the

                                      B-5

Shareholder will not, and will instruct its agents and affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, make or authorize any public statement, recommendation
or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal made by any Person or
group (other than Parent or Merger Sub). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
action taken by the Company or any member of the Company Board of Directors, in
his capacity as such, in accordance with Section 6.3 of the Merger Agreement
shall be deemed not to violate this Section 4(f).

            (g) The Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) tender
its Shares in any tender offer or exchange offer for the Shares; (ii) except as
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, otherwise offer for

encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of, any or all of its Shares or any
interest therein; (iii) except as contemplated by this Agreement, grant any
proxies or powers of attorney, deposit any of its Shares into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement with respect to any Shares; (iv) take any action
that would make any representation or warranty of the Shareholder contained
herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the effect of
preventing or impairing the Shareholder from performing its obligations under
this Agreement; or (v) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
with the intent or effect of delaying, terminating, preventing or affecting
negatively the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

            (h) The Shareholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Series B
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and the Series C Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration, or any higher price as may be paid for any such Shares in the
Merger, as the case may be, are in full satisfaction of all obligations of the
Company to the Shareholder related to the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock, and upon receipt of such consideration, any and all claims of
the Shareholder against the Company or any of its affiliates relating to the
Series B Preferred Stock or the Series C Preferred Stock shall be waived and
released.

            (i) The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Parent and
Merger Sub are relying upon the foregoing representations, warranties and
covenants by the Shareholder, and on the Shareholder's execution and delivery of

of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the compliance by
the Shareholder with the provisions of this Agreement.

      Section 7. Further Assurances. From time to time, at Parent's reasonable
request and without further consideration, the Shareholder agrees to execute and

expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      Section 8. Stop Transfer; Form of Legend. The Shareholder agrees and
covenants to Parent that the Shareholder shall not, prior to the Option Closing

(b) request that the Company register the transfer (book-entry or otherwise) of
any certificate or uncertificated interest representing any of the Shareholder's

requested by Parent, any certificates representing the Shareholder's Shares
shall contain the following legend:

            "The securities  represented by this certificate are subject
            to certain  restrictions  on  transfer  and other terms of a
            Shareholder's Agreement,  dated as of August 24, 2001, among

paid in settlement, expenses of investigation and reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and other professionals) (collectively, "Losses"), that
they may incur arising out of or due to (i) the inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Shareholder contained in this Agreement, (ii)
the breach by the Shareholder of any covenant, undertaking or other agreement
contained in this Agreement and (iii) enforcing the indemnification rights
pursuant to this Section 9(a).

            (b) If any Indemnified Party shall believe that such Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly give to the Shareholder written notice thereof.
The failure of such Indemnified Party to give notice of any claim for
indemnification promptly shall not adversely affect such Indemnified Party's
right to indemnity hereunder, except to the extent that the Shareholder is
prejudiced by the delay in giving notice. All such claims for indemnification
shall be made not later than, and the representations and warranties of the
Shareholder contained in this Agreement (other than the representations and
warranties set forth in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (e) of Section 4, which
shall survive indefinitely) shall not survive beyond, midnight on the date that
is one year after the first to occur of

                                      B-8

the Effective Time and the Option Closing. The right to indemnification
hereunder shall not be affected by any investigation or any knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

      Section 10. Obligation  After  Option  Closing to Acquire All  Minority
Interests.

            (a) Parent agrees that, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but,
in any case, not later than five business days) after the Option Closing, Parent
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) an
offer to purchase for cash (the "Offer") all, but not less than all, of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock owned by the holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Parent and Merger Sub) and the outstanding shares of
Series D Preferred Stock (collectively, the "Company Securities"), (i) in the
case of the Company Common Stock, at a price per share, net to the seller in
cash, that is not less than the Per Share Amount paid with respect to the
Company Common Stock as part of the Option Exercise Price (the "Common Stock
Reference Price") and (ii) in the case of the Series D Preferred Stock, at a
price per share, net to the seller in cash, that is not less than the Series D
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration (the "Series D Reference Price").

            The obligation of Parent to accept for payment and to pay for
Company Securities validly tendered in the Offer and not subsequently withdrawn
shall be subject only to (i) the condition that there shall not be any statute,
rule, regulation, judgment, order or injunction enacted, entered, enforced or
promulgated by any Governmental Entity which restrains, prevents or prohibits
the making or consummation of the Offer or the consummation of the Secondary
Merger (as defined below); provided, however, that Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have any such statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order
or injunction vacated or lifted; and (ii) such conditions as, after consultation
with Parent's outside legal counsel, Parent determines in good faith are
required by applicable law with respect to the Offer.

            (b) Following Parent's or Merger Sub's acceptance for payment of and
payment for Company Securities pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Time"),
Parent shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause consummation as
promptly as reasonably practicable of a second-step merger (the "Secondary
Merger") in which (i) the holders of the outstanding Company Securities will
receive per-share consideration, net to such holders in cash, without interest
thereon and less any applicable withholding of taxes, equal to (A) the Series D
Reference Price, in the case of Series D Preferred Stock, or (B) the Common
Stock Reference Price, in the case of Company Common Stock, and (ii) each
option, warrant or other right to purchase Company Common Stock will (1) to the
extent consistent with the terms thereof, be canceled immediately prior to the
consummation of the Secondary Merger, in consideration for which cancellation
the holder of such option, warrant or right shall receive a payment of cash
consideration equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such option, warrant or right immediately prior to the
consummation of the Secondary Merger and (B) t
