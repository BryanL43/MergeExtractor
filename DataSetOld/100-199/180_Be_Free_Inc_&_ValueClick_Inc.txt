    To the stockholders of ValueClick, Inc. and Be Free, Inc.

this transaction.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER    

Q:

What will I receive in the merger?

A:



If the merger is completed, Be Free stockholders will receive 0.65882 of a share of ValueClick common stock for each share of Be Free common stock that they own. Be Free stockholders will receive a cash payment for any fractional share. For example,
a Be Free stockholder owning 100 shares of Be Free common stock will receive 65 shares of ValueClick common stock and a cash payment equal to the value of 0.882 of one share of ValueClick common stock.



If the merger is completed, ValueClick stockholders will continue to hold their existing ValueClick common stock. ValueClick stockholders immediately prior to the merger will hold approximately 55% of ValueClick's common stock when the merger is
completed.

Q:

What do I need to do now?

A:

After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this document, please respond by completing, signing and dating your proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage paid envelope as soon as possible so that your shares may be
represented at your stockholder meeting. In addition, Be Free stockholders may also vote over the Internet by following the instructions on the proxy card.

If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, you should follow the directions provided by your broker. Your broker will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how you would like your shares to be voted.

Q:

What if I don't vote?

A:



If you are a ValueClick stockholder and fail to respond, it will have no effect on the vote to approve the merger proposal; 
however
, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to amend
ValueClick's certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock ValueClick may issue. If the merger proposal is approved by ValueClick's stockholders but there are insufficient votes to approve the amendment of
ValueClick's certificate of incorporation, ValueClick will not have enough shares of common stock to issue to Be Free stockholders in the merger and ValueClick will not be able to complete the merger.



If you are a Be Free stockholder and fail to respond, it will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal.



If you are a stockholder of either ValueClick or Be Free and respond but do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote for the merger proposal.



If you are a ValueClick stockholder and respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have no effect on the vote to approve the merger proposal; 
however,
 it will have the same effect as a vote against
the proposal to amend ValueClick's certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock ValueClick may issue. If the merger proposal is approved by ValueClick's stockholders but there are insufficient votes to
approve the amendment of ValueClick's certificate of incorporation, ValueClick will not have enough shares of common stock to issue to Be Free stockholders in the merger and ValueClick will not be able to complete the merger.

iii



If you are a Be Free stockholder and respond and abstain from voting, your proxy will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal.

Q:

Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?

A:

Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at your annual meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:



First, you can revoke your proxy.



Second, you can submit a new proxy.

If you choose either of these two methods, you must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to the secretary of ValueClick or Be Free, as appropriate, before your annual meeting. You can submit your notice of revocation by U.S. mail or by
facsimile. However, if you are submitting a new proxy, the new proxy must be submitted by U.S. mail or other delivery service. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you should contact your brokerage firm or bank to change
your vote.



Third, if you are a holder of record, you can attend your annual meeting and vote in person. Your attendance at your annual meeting alone will not revoke your proxy. Only your vote at your annual meeting will revoke your proxy.

Q:

Should I send in my Be Free stock certificates now?

A:

No. After the merger is completed, Be Free stockholders will receive written instructions from the exchange agent on how to exchange Be Free stock certificates for shares of ValueClick. 
Please do not send in your Be Free
stock certificates with your proxy.

Q:

When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A:

ValueClick and Be Free are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. ValueClick and Be Free anticipate completing the merger shortly after the ValueClick and Be Free stockholders have approved the merger proposal. ValueClick and Be Free
hope to complete the merger before the end of the second quarter of 2002.

Q:

Who can help answer my questions?

referred to in its opinion, the exchange ratio of 0.65882 a share of ValueClick common stock for a share of Be Free common stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of ValueClick
common stock. The fairness opinion is not a recommendation to any stockholder to approve the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock. The full text of this opinion is attached as Annex B to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on
the review undertaken.

We encourage you to read this opinion carefully in its entirety for a description of the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken. 

Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion

ValueClick annual meeting, you are entitled to receive this document and to vote in connection with the merger. On that date, there
were                        shares of ValueClick common stock outstanding,
approximately                        of which, or            percent,
were owned by ValueClick's directors and executive officers. You can cast one vote for each share of ValueClick common stock you
own. 

        Be Free.
    If you owned shares of Be Free on            , 2002, the record
date for the Be Free annual meeting, you are
entitled to receive this document and to vote in connection with the merger. On that date, there
were                        shares of Be Free common stock outstanding,
approximately            of
which, or            percent, were owned by Be Free's directors and executive officers. You can cast one vote for each share of Be Free common stock you own. 

Votes Required (see pages 34 and 37)  

        ValueClick.
    The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of ValueClick common stock voting on the proposal
is required to approve the merger proposal and to grant discretionary authority to ValueClick's board of directors or its chairman to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting to solicit additional votes
to approve the proposals presented at the annual meeting. 

        The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of ValueClick common 

stock outstanding as of the record date is required to approve the proposal to amend and restate ValueClick's amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 

        Even
though the merger proposal and the proposal to amend the certificate of incorporation are independent proposals and approval of one is not conditioned on approval of the other,
ValueClick cannot consummate the merger without approval of the proposal to amend its certificate of incorporation. Therefore, if the merger proposal is approved, but the amendment to the certificate
of incorporation is not approved, the merger will not be completed. Conversely, if the amendment to the certificate of incorporation is approved but the merger proposal is not approved, ValueClick's
authorized shares will be increased, even though ValueClick will not be able to consummate the merger and, therefore, will not be issuing any shares pursuant to the merger agreement. 

        In
addition, the nine director nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares of ValueClick common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual
meeting and entitled to vote, shall be elected as directors of ValueClick. 

        Be Free.
    The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Be Free common stock outstanding as of the record
date is required to approve the merger proposal. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of Be Free common stock voting on the proposal is required to grant discretionary authority
to Be Free's board of directors or its chairman to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting to solicit additional votes to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Be Free common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote is required to ratify the appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Be Free's independent auditors for the 2002 fiscal year. In addition, the two director nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares of Be Free
common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote, shall be elected as directors of Be Free. 

Voting Agreements  

        ValueClick.
    ValueClick entered into voting agreements with ten directors, officers and stockholders of Be Free, which require
those persons to vote an aggregate of 11,245,652 shares of Be Free common stock held by them in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. As of the record date, these
shares represented approximately        % of the voting power of Be Free capital stock subject to the voting agreements. 

        Be Free.
    Be Free entered into voting agreements with seven directors, officers and stockholders of ValueClick which require
those persons to vote an aggregate of 8,467,548 shares of ValueClick common stock held by them in favor of the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. As of the
record date, these shares represented approximately        % of the voting power of ValueClick capital stock subject to the voting agreements. 

Appraisal Rights (see page 62)  

        Under Delaware law, Be Free stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

Conflicts of Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 58)  

        Some of the directors and executive officers of ValueClick and Be Free will receive benefits if the merger is completed, which results in those persons having
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of their company's stockholders. Each board of directors took into account these interests prior to making its
decision. Specifically, as a result of or in connection with the merger: 


Three
Be Free directors,                              ,
                              and           
                   , will become directors of ValueClick; 


During
a transition period, Gordon B. Hoffstein is expected to serve as the chief executive of ValueClick's Be Free business reporting to James R. Zarley,
ValueClick's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President;


Stock
options issued to Be Free executive officers and directors to purchase an aggregate of            shares of Be Free common stock at a
weighted-average exercise price of $    per share, and that would be exercisable on the first anniversary of the merger, will become fully vested;


Be
Free's repurchase right will lapse for 25% (the equivalent of one year accelerated vesting) of the shares of restricted stock issued to Be Free executive
officers and directors in an aggregate amount of                        at a weighted-average stock price of
$    per share; and


Be
Free directors and executive officers will have the right to continued indemnification and insurance coverage by ValueClick for acts and omissions
occurring prior to the merger. 

Treatment of Be Free Stock Options and Restricted Stock (see page 63)  

        When the merger is completed, each outstanding Be Free stock option will be assumed by ValueClick and will be converted into an option to purchase that number of
shares of ValueClick common stock equal to the product of 0.65882 multiplied by the number of shares of Be Free common stock underlying the option. The exercise price will also be adjusted to give
effect to the exchange ratio. 

        Most
Be Free option agreements provide that the optionee will be entitled to one year of vesting credit upon the effectiveness of the merger. If the optionee is involuntarily terminated
prior to the two-year anniversary of the merger, then the vesting of the option will accelerate in full. 

        Most
Be Free restricted stock agreements provide that the number of shares subject to Be Free's repurchase right shall be reduced by 25% (the equivalent of one year of accelerated
vesting) upon the effectiveness of the merger. If the holder is involuntarily terminated prior to the two-year anniversary of the merger, then vesting will accelerate in full and all
repurchase rights will terminate. 

Tax Consequences (see page 60)  

        The merger has been structured with the intent that it qualify as a tax-deferred "reorganization" for federal income tax purposes. Qualification of
the merger as a reorganization will result in the following federal income tax consequences to the Be Free stockholders: 


A
Be Free stockholder's exchange of shares of Be Free common stock for shares of ValueClick common stock will not result in recognition of any taxable income
by the Be Free stockholder. However, any cash received for any fractional share will result in the recognition of gain or loss as if a Be Free stockholder sold its fractional share.


A
Be Free stockholder's tax basis in the shares of ValueClick common stock received in the merger will equal the Be Free stockholder's current tax basis in
the Be Free common stock, reduced by the basis allocable to any fractional share interest for which it receives cash, and the holding period of the ValueClick common stock received will include the
holding period of the stockholder's Be Free common stock that is exchanged, provided that such Be Free common stock is held as a capital asset. 

        Brobeck,
Phleger & Harrison LLP, counsel to ValueClick, has rendered an opinion to ValueClick and Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel to Be Free, has rendered an opinion to Be Free, that
the merger will constitute a "reorganization" for federal income tax purposes and that the material federal income tax consequences to the Be Free stockholders of the exchange of their shares of Be
Free common stock for shares of ValueClick common stock in the merger will be as described above. The 

discussion above constitutes the opinion of both Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP and Hale and Dorr LLP. The merger will not be completed unless ValueClick and Be Free receive opinions of their
respective counsel confirming their opinions as to the qualification of the merger as a reorganization. In rendering such opinions, counsel will base their opinions on certain assumptions and will
rely upon representations received by counsel from ValueClick and Be Free. 

Overview of the Merger Agreement (see page 63)  

        Conditions to the Completion of the Merger.
    Each of ValueClick's and Be Free's obligation to complete the merger is subject

merger agreement, if Be Free breaches its representations and warranties or covenants in the merger agreement in a manner that would cause the conditions to ValueClick's obligations to complete the
merger to not be satisfied, or if ValueClick's board of directors, after complying with the terms of the merger agreement, decides to accept a superior proposal from a third party so long as
ValueClick has given Be Free five business days notice (and negotiated in good faith with Be Free) and ValueClick has paid Be Free a termination fee.

Free may terminate the merger agreement if ValueClick's board of directors fails to recommend the merger proposal or effects a

Federal Trade Commission of the merger and have filed the necessary report forms, and until a required waiting period has ended. ValueClick and Be Free have filed the required information and

the ValueClick stockholders approve the increase in the authorized shares set forth in Proposal Number Two. The merger will become effective when a certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, which will occur as soon as possible after the stockholders of ValueClick and Be Free have approved the proposals at their respective annual meetings. ValueClick and Be

 Introduction  

        On March 10, 2002, ValueClick signed a definitive merger agreement with Be Free. The following unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial
statements present the effects of the proposed merger between ValueClick and Be Free under the purchase method of accounting. Upon closing of the merger, Be Free stockholders will receive 0.65882 of a
share of ValueClick stock for each share of Be Free. 

        The
accompanying unaudited pro forma combined consolidated balance sheet assumes that the merger took place as of December 31, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined consolidated
balance sheet combines the audited consolidated balance sheet of ValueClick as of December 31, 2001 and the audited consolidated balance sheet of Be Free as of December 31, 2001. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined consolidated statements of operations give effect to the merger with Be Free as if it occurred as of January 1, 2001. The accompanying pro forma
combined consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 presents ValueClick's pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2001 combined with Be Free's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. The pro forma ValueClick consolidated statement of operations reflects the historical
results of ValueClick for the year ended December 31, 2001, adjustments to reflect the 2001 operating results of Mediaplex prior to the acquisition in October 2001 and additional
acquisition related pro forma adjustments. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, are provided for illustrative purposes only
and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position that actually would have occurred if the merger had been consummated as of the dates indicated, nor
are they necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position. The combined company will focus on the growing Internet advertising solutions market. The pro forma adjustments are
based on the
information available at the date of this joint proxy statement-prospectus and are subject to change based upon completion of the transaction and final purchase price allocation. 

        The
unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the ValueClick historical consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in ValueClick's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the Be Free historical consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in Be Free's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, as well as the "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        The
fair value per share of the stock issued in the merger represents the average market price of ValueClick common stock, as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market for the 5 days
immediately prior to, the day of and the 5 days immediately after, the announcement of the acquisition. The fair value of options assumed was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
using the following assumptions: 52% of expected volatility; 3.66% risk free interest rate; 4 year expected term; and a zero dividend yield. The intrinsic value allocable to unvested stock
options assumed was reflected as deferred stock compensation. 

        The
net book value of the assets acquired exceeded the total purchase price. The amounts of the non-current assets written off are presented as if the transaction occurred on
December 31, 2001.

balances. Depreciation expense was included in sales and marketing and general and administrative expense. 

3. Pro Forma Adjustments:  

        The pro forma adjustments to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the following: 

(a)
PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe elimination of a portion of the Be Free property and equipment and intangible assets is a result of applying purchase
accounting to the transaction considering that the net book value of the assets acquired was in excess of the purchase price. As of December 31, 2001, Be Free performed an 

impairment
assessment of its long-lived assets and determined that no impairment existed based on Be Free's undiscounted cash flows. 

(b)
ACCOUNTS
PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSESTo record an accrual for the estimated direct merger-related costs of $2,650 to be incurred by Be Free and $2,025 to be incurred by

common stock.

(d)

ValueClick's financial presentation.

(e)
COST
OF SALES, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE, RESEARCH, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING, AND AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND CHARGE FOR IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETSThe
adjustment to depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and charge for impairment of assets reflects the elimination of a significant portion of the Be Free property and equipment and intangible
assets as of January 1, 2001, as a result of applying purchase accounting to the transaction considering that the net book value of assets acquired was in excess of the purchase price.

(f)
PRO
FORMA BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHAREReflects the issuance of approximately 43.4 million shares of our common stock, excluding shares to be issued upon exercise
of options to purchase shares of Be Free common stock assumed in the acquisition and after giving effect to the exchange ratio as contemplated in the merger agreement.

(g)
DEFERRED
STOCK COMPENSATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONThe adjustments reflect the effects of allocating deferred stock compensation for the intrinsic value of Be Free's

RISK FACTORS    

Before you vote for adoption or approval of the merger agreement, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to
the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this document, including the section entitled "Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information." The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones facing ValueClick and Be Free. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to either of ValueClick or Be Free or that we believe are now immaterial may
also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our common stock
could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Associated With the Merger    

Decreases in the trading price of ValueClick will reduce the value of what Be Free stockholders receive in the merger.

        Upon
completion of the merger, shares of Be Free capital stock will be converted into shares of ValueClick capital stock. The ratio at which the shares will be converted is fixed, and
there will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of either Be Free common stock or ValueClick common stock. Any change in the price of ValueClick common stock will affect the value that Be
Free stockholders receive in the merger. Be Free's common stock and ValueClick's common stock have historically experienced significant volatility, and the value of the shares of ValueClick's common
stock received in the merger may fluctuate. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond the control of Be Free and ValueClick. Neither party is permitted to terminate the
merger agreement or resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely because of changes in the market price of either party's common stock. 

        The
prices of Be Free common stock and ValueClick common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from their respective prices on the date of this document and on the date of the
annual meetings. Because the date the merger is completed may be later than the date of the annual meetings, the
prices of Be Free's common stock and ValueClick's common stock on the date of the annual meetings may not be indicative of their respective prices on the date the merger is completed. 

The purchase price that Be Free stockholders will receive in the merger is less than the cash per share value of Be Free, and the exchange ratio in the merger may not equal or
exceed the cash per share value of Be Free.

        Be
Free agreed to a purchase price that is less than its cash per share value because it believed that the stock market was currently over-discounting the Internet
advertising companies such as ValueClick that trade on the Nasdaq National Market. This over-discount of ValueClick's stock was evidenced by the fact that its stock was trading at a price
less than its cash per share value. Additionally, the Be Free board believed that upon any liquidation it would be required to settle customer obligations that, along with greater losses anticipated
to be realized once any decision to liquidate was announced, would reduce significantly the amount of cash that could be available for distribution to its stockholders upon any liquidation. If the
price of ValueClick's stock does not rise in the future from its current trading levels, however, the exchange ratio will result in Be Free stockholders receiving an amount of ValueClick stock that
constitutes a purchase price less than the cash per share value of Be Free. 

ValueClick and Be Free may not realize the intended benefits of the merger if ValueClick is unable to integrate Be Free's operations, products and personnel in a timely and
efficient manner.

        Achieving
the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the integration of ValueClick's and Be Free's operations, products and personnel in a timely and efficient manner. For
ValueClick to provide 

enhanced and more valuable products to its customers after the merger, ValueClick will need to integrate Be Free's development operations and product lines. This integration may be difficult and
unpredictable because Be Free's products are highly complex, have been developed independently and were designed without regard to integration. Successful integration of Be Free product development
operations and product lines also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams, as well as sales and marketing efforts and personnel. This, too, may be difficult and
unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts between the companies, the different geographical locations of the companies, and different opinions on product and technology decisions. If
ValueClick cannot successfully integrate Be Free's operations, products and personnel, ValueClick and Be Free may not realize the expected benefits of the merger which could adversely affect the
combined company's business. 

The merger will result in significant costs to ValueClick and Be Free, whether or not the merger is completed.

        The
merger will result in significant costs to ValueClick and Be Free. Transaction costs are estimated at approximately $4.5 million. These costs are expected to consist primarily
of fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, filing fees and financial printers. All of these costs will be incurred whether or not the merger is completed. If the merger agreement is
terminated under specified circumstances, Be Free and ValueClick may be obligated to pay the other party a $5,133,126 termination fee. In addition, Be Free and ValueClick may be obligated under some
circumstances to reimburse the other company's costs up to a maximum of $1,283,282. 

Directors of ValueClick and Be Free have potential conflicts of interest in recommending that you vote in favor of approval of the merger agreement.

        Some
of the directors of ValueClick and some of the directors of Be Free who recommend that you vote in favor of the merger agreement have employment or severance agreements or benefits
arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that differ from yours. Following completion of the merger, Gordon B. Hoffstein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Be Free is
expected to serve, for a transition period, in a similar position with ValueClicks's Be Free subsidiary; and Samuel P. Gerace, Jr. and Stephen M. Joseph, Chief Technology Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, respectively, of Be Free are expected to serve in similar capacities with ValueClick's Be Free subsidiary, in each case reporting to James R. Zarley, Chairman of the Board, Chief
Executive Officer and President of ValueClick. In addition, three current Be Free directors will become directors of ValueClick after completion of the merger. The receipt of compensation or other
benefits in the merger, including the vesting of stock options, or the continuation of indemnification arrangements for current directors of Be Free following completion of the merger, may influence
these directors in making their recommendation that you vote in favor of the merger agreement. 

Failure to complete the merger could cause ValueClick's or Be Free's stock price to decline.

        If
the merger is not completed for any reason, ValueClick's or Be Free's stock price may decline because costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisor
fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed. In addition, if the merger is not completed, ValueClick's or Be Free's stock price may decline to the extent that the current market price
reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. 

If the conditions to the merger are not met, the merger will not occur.

        Specified
conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger. These conditions are described in detail in the merger agreement. ValueClick and Be Free cannot assure you that
each of the conditions will be satisfied. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not occur or will be delayed, and ValueClick and Be Free each may lose some or all of the
intended benefits of 

the merger. For example, if either party suffers a material adverse change prior to closing, the other party will not be required to close. 

ValueClick and Be Free may waive one or more of the conditions to the merger without resoliciting stockholder approval for the merger.

        Each
of the conditions to ValueClick's and Be Free's obligations to complete the merger may be waived, in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, by agreement of
ValueClick and Be Free. The boards of directors of ValueClick and Be Free will evaluate the materiality of any such waiver to determine whether amendment of this document and resolicitation of proxies
is warranted. However, ValueClick and Be Free generally do not expect any such waiver to be sufficiently material to warrant resolicitation of stockholders. In the event that the board of directors of
ValueClick or Be Free determines any such waiver is not sufficiently material to warrant resolicitation of stockholders, the applicable company will have the discretion to complete the merger without
seeking further stockholder approval. 

Sales of ValueClick's and Be Free's products and services could decline if customer relationships are disrupted by the merger.

        The
merger may disrupt customer relationships. ValueClick's and Be Free's customers may not continue their current buying patterns during the pendency of, and following, the merger.
Customers may defer purchasing decisions as they evaluate the likelihood of successful integration of ValueClick's and Be Free's products and services and the combined company's future product
strategy. ValueClick's or Be Free's customers may instead purchase products and services of competitors. In addition, by increasing the breadth of ValueClick's and Be Free's business, the merger may
make it more difficult for the combined company to enter into relationships with customers and strategic partners, some of whom may view the combined company as a more-direct competitor
than either ValueClick or Be Free as independent companies. Any significant delay or reduction in orders for ValueClick's or Be Free's products could cause sales of the combined company's products to
decline. 

Risks Related to the Combined Operations of ValueClick and Be Free Following the Merger    

Integrating ValueClick's and Be Free's operations may divert management's attention away from its day-to-day operations.

        Integration
of ValueClick's and Be Free's operations, products and personnel may place a significant burden on management and its internal resources. The diversion of management's
attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm the combined company's business. 

If the combined company fails to manage its growth effectively, its expenses could increase and its management's time and attention could be diverted.

        As
the combined company continues to increase the scope of its operations, it will need an effective planning and management process to implement its business plan successfully in the
rapidly evolving Internet advertising market. The combined company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be substantially harmed if the combined company is unable to manage
its expanding operations effectively. The combined company plans to continue to expand its sales and marketing, customer support and research and development organizations. Past growth has placed, and
any future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on its management systems and resources. ValueClick has recently implemented a new financial reporting system, and the combined company
will likely need to continue to improve its financial and managerial controls and its reporting systems and procedures. In addition, the combined company will need to expand, train and manage its work
force. 

The combined company's failure to manage the combined company's growth effectively could increase its expenses and divert management's time and attention. 

Unexpected significant costs to integrate ValueClick and Be Free into a single business may negatively impact the financial condition of the combined company and the market
price of ValueClick's stock.

        ValueClick
and Be Free will incur costs from integrating Be Free's operations, products and personnel. These costs may be significant and may include expenses and other liabilities for: 


employee
redeployment, relocation or severance;


conversion
of information systems;


combining
teams and processes in various functional areas;


reorganization
or closures of facilities; and


relocation
or disposition of excess equipment. 

        The
integration costs that ValueClick and Be Free incur may negatively impact the financial condition of the combined company and the market price of ValueClick's stock. 

Be Free and ValueClick have limited operating histories, a history of losses, an accumulated deficit and may continue to experience losses.

        For
the year ended December 31, 2001, Be Free incurred a net loss of approximately $142.0 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $231.9 million. For
the year ended December 31, 2001, ValueClick incurred a net loss of approximately $7.2 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $63.6 million. Be Free's current
business has never achieved profitability and it expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future in light of the level of its amortization of intangible assets and planned operating and
capital expenditures. These losses will be substantial, and ValueClick and Be Free may never become profitable. 

        Because
ValueClick and Be Free have limited operating histories, it may be difficult to evaluate business and prospects of the combined company. You should consider the combined
company's prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in the rapidly-changing Internet market. These risks include the combined company's
ability to: 


maintain
and increase its inventory of advertising space on Web sites;


maintain
and increase the number of advertisers that use its products and services and offer banner advertisements that generate significant response rates;


continue
to expand the number of products and services it offers and the capacity of its systems;


continue
to increase the acceptance of the cost-per-click, or CPC, pricing model; and


adapt
to changes in Web advertisers' promotional needs and policies, and the technologies used to generate Web advertisements. 

        If
the combined company is unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties, its business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected. 

If the Internet fails to grow as an advertising, marketing and sales medium, the combined company's future revenue and business prospects would be materially and adversely
affected.

        The
combined company's future revenue and business prospects depend in part on a significant increase in the use of the Internet as an advertising, marketing and sales medium. Internet
advertising and marketing is new and rapidly evolving, and it cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media or marketing programs to gauge its effectiveness. As a result, demand for, and
market 

acceptance of, Internet advertising and marketing solutions are uncertain. Further, the Internet is still emerging as a significant channel for selling goods and services to consumers. The combined
company's business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected if the Internet does not become further accepted as an advertising and marketing medium or if consumers do not increasingly
purchase goods and services online. The adoption of Internet advertising and marketing services, particularly by entities that have historically relied upon more traditional methods, requires the
acceptance of a new way of advertising and marketing. These customers may find Internet advertising and marketing to be less effective for meeting their business needs than other methods of
advertising and marketing. 

The combined company may face intellectual property disputes that are costly or could hinder or prevent its ability to deliver its products and
services.

        The
combined company may be subject to disputes and legal actions alleging intellectual property infringement, unfair competition or similar claims against it. One of the combined
company's principal competitors, DoubleClick, was awarded a patent on certain aspects of ad-delivery technology, including the ability to target the delivery of ads over a network such as
the Internet and the ability to compile statistics on individual Web users and the use of those statistics to target ads. DoubleClick has previously brought lawsuits against other companies in the
combined company's industry on the basis of this patent. ValueClick has, however, entered into an agreement with DoubleClick whereby DoubleClick has agreed to not sue or threaten to sue ValueClick or
any of its customers, affiliates or licensees, in connection with its patent, so long as DoubleClick or any of its subsidiaries hold at least five percent of ValueClick's capital stock on a
fully-diluted basis. DoubleClick has agreed that if it no longer owns at least five percent of ValueClick's capital stock, it will in good faith negotiate with ValueClick for a license to use its
technology under commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that ValueClick or the combined company will be able to secure such a license. 

        Other
companies may apply for or be awarded patents or have other intellectual property rights covering aspects of the combined company's technology or business. In 2000, 24/7 Real Media
was awarded a patent relating to its technology for delivering content and advertising information over the Internet. ValueClick is currently involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with 24/7 Real
Media related
to its ad-serving technology. The combined company cannot assure you that its patents or any future patents or service mark registrations it receives will not be successfully challenged by
others or invalidated. In addition, the combined company cannot assure you that it does not infringe any intellectual property rights of third parties or that it will be able to prevent
misappropriation of the combined company's technologies, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect the combined company's rights as fully as in the
United States. The combined company's failure to prevail in any litigation with any party asserting intellectual property infringement, including ValueClick's current lawsuit with 24/7 Real Media,
could result in substantial monetary damages, including: damages for past infringement, which could be tripled if a court determines that the infringement was willful; an injunction requiring the
combined company to stop offering its services in their current form; the need to redesign ValueClick's or Be Free's systems; or the need to pay significant license fees to use technology belonging to
third parties. See "Risk FactorsIf the combined company is unsuccessful in defending against 24/7 Real Media's lawsuit for patent infringement, it may be required to pay significant
monetary damages to 24/7 Real Media and may be enjoined from utilizing its ad-serving technology in its business." 

If the combined company is unsuccessful in defending against 24/7 Real Media's lawsuit for patent infringement, it may be required to pay significant monetary damages to 24/7
Real Media and may be enjoined from utilizing its ad-serving technology in its business.

        In
February 2002, 24/7 Real Media, Inc. filed a lawsuit against ValueClick and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mediaplex, Inc., in the District Court for the Southern
District of New York seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief arising from their alleged infringement of 24/7 Real Media's 

'368 patent. ValueClick filed a Declaratory Judgment action in the District Court for the Northern District of California in February 2002 seeking to move the case to California. 

        This
lawsuit is in the early stages. The combined company intends to defend itself vigorously in this lawsuit. Although ValueClick believes 24/7 Real Media's patent infringement
allegations are without merit, the outcome of this lawsuit is uncertain. ValueClick's expenses and other resources expended on this lawsuit have not been material to date. However, as this lawsuit
progresses, the combined company will likely incur greater legal fees and expenses. In addition, the combined company's defense of this lawsuit is expected to divert the efforts and attention of its
management and technical personnel. As a result, the combined company's defense of this lawsuit, regardless of its eventual outcome, will likely be costly and time consuming. If 24/7 Real Media's
patent is found to be valid and enforceable and the combined company's ad-serving technology is found to infringe, the combined company may be enjoined from utilizing this technology in
its business, it may be liable for significant monetary damages and/or it may be required to obtain a license from 24/7 Real Media to use its patented technology, any of which could disrupt the
combined company's ability to offer its products and services. An injunction preventing the combined company from using its ad-serving technology would have a material adverse effect on
its business, operating results, cash flow, and financial condition. If the combined company is required to obtain a license to 24/7 Real Media's patent, such license may not be available from 24/7
Real Media on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

If the technology that ValueClick or Be Free currently uses to target the delivery of banners, track the effectiveness of online promotions or prevent fraud on their networks
is restricted or becomes subject to regulation, the combined company's expenses could increase and the combined company could lose customers or advertising inventory.

        Web
sites typically place small files of information, commonly known as cookies, on an Internet use's hard drive, generally without the user's knowledge or consent. Cookie information is
passed to the Web site through an Internet user's browser software. ValueClick and Be Free currently use cookies to track an Internet user's movement through the advertiser's Web site, including
gathering anonymous data related to the Internet user's online browsing and buying behavior, and to monitor and prevent potentially fraudulent activity on its network. ValueClick and Be Free do not
share, collect or sell any other information concerning Internet users. Most currently available Internet browsers allow Internet users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being
stored on their hard drive, and some users currently do so. Internet users can also delete cookies from their hard drives at any time. Some Internet commentators and privacy advocates have suggested
limiting or eliminating the use of cookies, and legislation has been introduced in some jurisdictions to regulate the use of cookie technology. The effectiveness of ValueClick's and Be Free's
technology could be limited by any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies. If the use or effectiveness of cookies is limited, the combined company would have to switch to other technologies to
gather demographic and behavioral information. While such technologies currently exist, they are substantially less effective than cookies. The combined company would also have to develop or acquire
other technology to prevent fraud. Replacement of cookies could require significant reengineering time and resources, might not be completed in time to avoid losing customers or advertising inventory
and might not be commercially feasible. In addition, privacy concerns may cause visitors to avoid Internet sites that track behavioral information and even the perception of security and privacy
concerns, whether or not valid, may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of the combined company's services. ValueClick's or Be Free's use of cookie technology or any other technologies designed to
collect Internet usage information may subject it to litigation or investigations in the future. Any litigation or government action against either ValueClick or Be Free could be costly and
time-consuming, could require the combined company to change its business practices and could divert management's attention. 

The combined company could lose customers or advertising inventory if it fails to measure clicks on banner advertisements in a manner that is acceptable to its advertisers and
Web publishers.

        ValueClick
and Be Free earn revenues and make payments to Web publishers based on the number of clicks on advertisements. Advertisers' and Web publishers' willingness to use the combined
company's services will depend on the extent to which they perceive the combined company's measurements of clicks to be accurate and reliable. Advertisers and Web publishers often maintain their own
technologies and methodologies for counting clicks, and from time to time, each of ValueClick and Be Free has had to resolve differences between its measurements and theirs. Any significant dispute
over the proper measurement of clicks or other user responses to advertisements could cause the combined company to lose customers, advertising inventory, or revenue. 

If the combined company fails to compete effectively against other Internet advertising companies, it could lose customers or advertising inventory and its revenues could
decline.

        The
Internet advertising markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions and changing client
demands. The introduction of new services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render the combined company's existing services obsolete and
unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in research and development. The combined company's failure to adapt successfully to these changes could harm its business, results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition. 

        The
market for Internet advertising and related services is intensely competitive. The combined company expects this competition to continue to increase because there are no significant
barriers to entry. Increased competition may result in price reductions for advertising space, reduced margins and loss of our market share. The combined company's principal competitors are other
companies that provide advertisers with performance-based Internet advertising solutions, such as CPC, CPL or CPA. ValueClick directly competes with a number of competitors in the CPC market segment,
such as Advertising.com and Datacomm. ValueClick also competes in the performance-based marketing segment with CPL and CPA performance-based companies such as CyberAgents, DirectLeads and
CommissionJunction. In the site personalization solutions market, Be Free competes with companies such as Net Perceptions and Nynaptics. In addition, a portion of Be Free's tracking and analyzing
services may be considered similar to features found in services provided by electronic customer relationship management solutions, such as E.piphany and Accrue. ValueClick and Be Free also compete
with other Internet advertising networks that focus on the traditional CPM model, including DoubleClick, Engage and 24/7 Real Media. Unlike ValueClick and Be Free, these companies primarily deal with
publishers of large Web sites and advertisers seeking increased brand recognition. These companies have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and have greater financial and marketing
resources than ValueClick and Be Free. 

        Competition
for advertising placements among current and future suppliers of Internet navigational and informational services, high-traffic Web sites and Internet service
providers, or ISPs, as well as competition with other media for advertising placements, could result in significant price competition and reductions in advertising revenues. In addition, as the
combined company expands the scope of its Web services, it may compete with a greater number of Web publishers and other media companies across an increasing range of different Web services, including
in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer services that provide significant
performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by the combined company, its business, result of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected. The combined
company will also compete with traditional advertising media, such as direct mail, television, radio, cable and print, for a share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential
competitors enjoy competitive advantages over 

ValueClick and Be Free, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic Web sites, and
significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, the combined company may not be able to compete
successfully. If the combined company fails to compete successfully, it could lose customers or advertising inventory and its revenues could decline. 

The combined company's revenue growth could be negatively impacted if Internet usage and the development of Internet infrastructure do not continue to
grow.

        The
combined company's business and financial results will depend on continued growth in the use of the Internet. Internet usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons, such as:
inadequate network infrastructure; security concerns; inconsistent quality of service; and unavailability of cost-effective, high-speed service. If Internet usage grows, its
infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it and its performance and reliability may decline. In addition, Web sites have experienced interruptions in their service as a result
of outages and other delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure, and as a result of sabotage, such as the electronic attacks designed to interrupt service on many Web sites. The
Internet could lose its viability as a commercial medium due to delays in the development or adoption of new technology required to accommodate increased levels of Internet activity. If use of the
Internet does not continue to grow, or if the Internet infrastructure does not effectively support its growth, the combined company's revenues could be materially and adversely affected. 

The combined company's long-term success may be materially adversely affected if the market for e-commerce does not grow or grows slower than
expected.

        Because
many of the combined company's customers' advertisements encourage online purchasing, the combined company's long-term success may depend in part on the growth and
market acceptance of e-commerce. The growth and acceptance of e-commerce has developed more slowly than expected and the combined company's business will be adversely affected
if the market for e-commerce does not grow or grows slower than now expected. A number of factors outside of the combined company's control could hinder the future growth of
e-commerce, including the following: 


the
network infrastructure necessary for substantial growth in Internet usage may not develop adequately or its performance and reliability may decline;


insufficient
availability of telecommunication services or changes in telecommunication services could result in inconsistent quality of service or slower
response times on the Internet;


negative
publicity and consumer concern surrounding the security of e-commerce could impede its acceptance and growth; and


financial
instability of e-commerce customers. 

        In
particular, any well-publicized compromise of security involving Web-based transactions could deter people from purchasing items on the Internet, clicking on
advertisements, or using the Internet generally, any of which could cause the combined company to lose customers and advertising inventory and could materially, adversely affect the combined company's
revenues. 

The combined company will depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm its business.

        The
successful integration of Be Free with ValueClick after the merger will depend in part on the retention of personnel critical to the business and operations of the combined company
due to, for example, unique technical skills or management expertise. The combined company may be unable to retain Be Free management, technical, sales and customer support personnel that are critical
to the success of the integrated companies, resulting in disruption of operations, loss of key information, 

expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs and otherwise diminishing anticipated benefits of the merger. 

        The
combined company's future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of its key senior management, technical and sales personnel and in particular the combined
company's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, James R. Zarley, and the combined company's Chief Operating Officer, Sam Paisley. ValueClick's employment agreements with its
key personnel are short-term and on an at-will basis. The combined company will not have key-person insurance on any of its employees. The loss of the services of
any member of its management team, or of any other key employees, could divert management's time and attention, increase the combined company's expenses and adversely affect its ability to conduct its
business efficiently. The combined company's future success also depends on the combined company's continuing ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. Competition for
employees in the combined company's industry is intense. The combined company may be unable to retain the combined company's key employees or attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified
employees in the future. ValueClick and Be Free have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of their business, and may experience similar
difficulties in the future. 

If the combined company does not successfully develop its international strategy, its revenues and cash flows and the growth of its business could be
harmed.

        The
combined company will have operations in foreign countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. The combined company's foreign operations will be subject
to foreign currency exchange risks. ValueClick and Be Free currently do not utilize hedging instruments to mitigate their foreign exchange risks. 

        The
combined company's international expansion will subject it to additional foreign currency exchange risks and will require management attention and resources. The combined company
expects to pursue expansion through a number of international alliances and to rely extensively on these business partners initially to conduct operations, establish local networks, register Web sites
as affiliates and coordinate sales and marketing efforts. The combined company's success in these markets will depend on the success of its business partners and their willingness to dedicate
sufficient resources to the relationships. The combined company cannot assure you that it will be successful in its efforts overseas. International operations are subject to other inherent risks,
including: 


the
impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;


changes
in and differences between regulatory requirements, domestic and foreign;


export
restrictions, including export controls relating to encryption technologies;


reduced
protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;


potentially
adverse tax consequences;


difficulties
and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;


political
and economic instability;


tariffs
and other trade barriers; and


seasonal
reductions in business activity. 

DoubleClick will remain the combined company's largest stockholder after the merger, and DoubleClick may have interests that are different from, or in addition to,
yours.

        DoubleClick,
which is one of ValueClick's and Be Free's competitors, currently owns approximately 15% of ValueClick's outstanding common stock and will own approximately 8.1% of the
combined 

company's outstanding common stock after the merger. DoubleClick has the right to maintain its percentage ownership if the combined company issues new securities, other than in a public offering, in
connection with an acquisition of, or merger with, another company or under other specified exceptions until February 28, 2003. DoubleClick may have interests that are different from, or in
addition to, your interests. Because ValueClick has generally agreed to use DoubleClick rather than other providers of services similar to those that DoubleClick makes available, and because the
combined company may have additional commercial relationships with DoubleClick in the future, conflicts of interest could arise with respect to the nature, quality and pricing of services that
DoubleClick provides to the combined company. DoubleClick currently has the right to designate one member of ValueClick's board of directors. In addition, the holders of approximately 12.2% of
ValueClick's currently outstanding common stock have agreed to vote their shares in favor of a specified number of DoubleClick's nominees to ValueClick's board of directors, depending on DoubleClick's
percentage ownership of ValueClick's common stock. Because DoubleClick provides Internet advertising services that compete with those of the combined company, conflicts of interest could arise for
DoubleClick's representatives on the combined company's board of directors. ValueClick has not implemented specific policies with respect to these potential conflicts of interest, which could be
resolved in a manner adverse to ValueClick. 

        If
the merger is completed, DoubleClick will own approximately 8.1% of the combined company's outstanding stock; thereafter, so long as DoubleClick owns less than 10% of the combined
company's common stock, it will not have the right to designate any person to the combined company's board of directors. 

Delaware law contains, and the combined company's board of directors could implement, anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that could be
beneficial to the combined company's stockholders.

        Provisions
of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the combined company, even if doing so would be beneficial to the combined company's stockholders.
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of ValueClick and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding
15% or more of ValueClick's outstanding voting stock from acquiring ValueClick without the board of director's consent for at least three years from the date they first hold 15% or more of the voting
stock. DoubleClick is not subject to this provision of Delaware law with respect to its investment in ValueClick. In addition, if the merger is completed, ValueClick's board of directors intends to
consider, and may implement anti-takeover provisions, including a shareholder rights plan, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the combined company, even if doing so would
be beneficial to the combined company's stockholders. 

System failures could significantly disrupt the combined company's operations, which could cause it to lose customers or advertising inventory.

        The
combined company's success depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of its systems. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt the combined company's ability
to provide services to customers, including failures affecting the combined company's ability to deliver and target advertisements and promotions quickly and accurately, to deliver reports to its
customers and their marketing partners and to process users' responses to advertisements, would reduce significantly the attractiveness of its solutions to advertisers and Web publishers. The combined
company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any damage or failure that interrupts or delays its operations. 

        The
combined company's operations depend on its ability to protect its computer systems against damage from fire, power loss, water damage, telecommunications failure, vandalism,
malicious human acts, natural disasters and similar unexpected adverse events. The combined company will lease server 

space in Los Angeles and Santa Clara, California; Boca Raton, Florida; Louisville, Kentucky; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; McLean, Virginia; and Tokyo, Japan. Therefore, any of the above factors
affecting the Boca Raton, Los Angeles, Louisville, McLean, Pittsburgh, Santa Clara, or Tokyo areas would substantially harm the combined company's business. Moreover, despite network security
measures, the combined company's servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems in part because the combined
company cannot control the maintenance and operation of its third-party data centers. Despite the precautions taken, unanticipated problems affecting the combined company's systems could cause
interruptions in the delivery of its solutions in the future. Be Free has experienced systems outages and denials of service in the past, during which it was unable to route transactions to its
customers from their marketing partners or provide reports. To date, these outages have not had a material effect on Be Free's operations. The combined company's data storage centers incorporate
redundant systems, consisting of additional servers, but its primary system does not switch over to its backup system automatically. The expansion of the combined company's existing data storage
centers and the opening of additional data storage centers also may not eliminate system outages or prevent the loss of sales when system outages occur. The combined company expects additional system
outages in the future. A prolonged system-wide outage or frequent outages could cause harm to the combined company's reputation and could cause its customers or their marketing partners to
make claims against the combined company for damages allegedly resulting from an outage. Any damage or failure that interrupts or delays the combined company's operations could result in material harm
to its business and expose it to material liabilities. The combined company's insurance policies may not adequately compensate it for any losses that may occur due to any failures in its systems. 

The combined company may experience capacity constraints that could reduce its revenues.

        The
combined company's future success depends in part on the efficient performance of its software and technology, as well as the efficient performance of the systems of third parties.
As the numbers of Web pages and Internet users increase, the combined company's services and infrastructure may not be
able to grow to meet the demand. A sudden and unexpected increase in the volume of advertising delivered through its servers or in click rates could strain the capacity of the software or hardware
that the combined company has deployed. Any capacity constraints the combined company experiences could lead to slower response times or system failures and adversely affect the availability of
advertisements, the number of advertising views delivered and the level of user responses received, which would harm the combined company's revenues. To the extent that the combined company does not
effectively address capacity constraints or system failures, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed substantially. The combined company will also depend on ISPs
that provide consumers with access to the Web sites on which its customers' advertisements appear. Internet users have occasionally experienced difficulties connecting to the Web due to failures of
their ISPs' systems. Any disruption in Internet access provided by ISPs or failures by ISPs to handle the higher volumes of traffic expected in the future could materially and adversely affect the
combined company's revenues. 

It may be difficult to predict the combined company's financial performance because its quarterly operating results may fluctuate.

        The
combined company's revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the combined company's control.
You should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of ValueClick's or Be Free's results of operations as an indication of the combined company's future performance. The
combined company's results of operations may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods. If 

this happens, the market price of ValueClick's common stock may fall. The factors that may affect the combined company's quarterly operating results include: 


fluctuations
in demand for its advertising solutions;


fluctuations
in click rates;


fluctuations
in the amount of available advertising space, or views, on Web sites in the combined company's network;


the
timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses incurred to attract new advertisers;


fluctuations
in sales of different types of advertising, for example, the amount of advertising sold at higher rates rather than lower rates;


seasonal
patterns in Internet advertisers' spending;


changes
in the combined company's pricing policies, the pricing policies of the combined company's competitors or the pricing policies for advertising on the
Internet generally;


timing
differences at the end of each quarter between the combined company's payments to Web publishers for a given set of clicks and its collection of
advertising revenue for those clicks; and


costs
related to acquisitions of technology or businesses. 

        Expenditures
by advertisers also tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Any decline in the economic prospects of
advertisers or the economy generally may alter current or prospective advertisers' spending priorities, or may increase the time it takes the combined company to close sales with advertisers, and
could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

The combined company may be unable to reduce spending if its revenues are lower than expected because its short-term expenses are fixed and future revenues and
operating results are difficult to forecast.

        The
combined company's current and future expense estimates are based, in large part, on its estimates of future revenues and on its investment plans. In particular, the combined company
plans to increase its operating expenses significantly in order to expand its sales and marketing operations; enhance its technology and software solutions; acquire additional advertising inventory;
enhance its advertising management platform; and continue its international expansion. Most of the combined company's expenses are fixed in the short term. The combined company may be unable to reduce
spending if its revenues are lower than expected. Any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to the combined company's expectations could materially and adversely affect its cash flows. 

        The
combined company's failure to address these risks adequately could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The combined company may be liable for content displayed on the Web sites of its publishers which could increase its expenses.

        The
combined company may be liable to third parties for content in the advertising it delivers if the artwork, text or other content involved violates copyright, trademark or other
intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory. The combined company will not be able to screen all of the content generated by its customers and their marketing
partners. As a result, the combined company may face potential liability for defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the materials displayed on
its customers sites and on their marketing partners' sites and e-mail messages. For example, if one of the combined company's customers is sued for posting information on its Internet site
that is alleged to be defamatory, the 

combined company may also be named as a defendant in that legal action based solely on its limited association with that customer's Internet site. As a result, the combined company could be involved
in legal proceedings and disputes that are costly to resolve, regardless of their lack of merit. The combined company may also suffer a loss of customers or reputational harm based on this information
or resulting from its involvement in these legal proceedings. Furthermore, some foreign governments have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the Internet that are more
strict than those currently in place in the United States. The combined company's insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify the combined company for all
liability that may be imposed. There is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims, if successfully asserted against the combined company, could exceed the total of its coverage limits. There is
also a risk that a single claim or multiple claims asserted against the combined company may not qualify for coverage under its insurance policies as a result of coverage exclusions that are contained
within these polices. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the combined
company's reputation and its business and operating results, or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties. 

Any breach of the combined company's security measures that results in the release of confidential customer data could cause customer dissatisfaction, customer loss, or both
and expose the combined company to lawsuits.

        Third
parties may attempt to breach the combined company's security. If they are successful, they could obtain the combined company's customers' or their marketing partners' confidential
information, including marketing data, sales data, passwords, financial account, performance and contact information. A breach of security could materially and adversely affect the combined company's
reputation, business and prospects. The combined company relies on encryption technology licensed from third parties. The combined company's systems are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or
electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays or loss or theft of data. The combined company may be required to expend significant capital and
other resources to license encryption technology and additional technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach. The combined company may be liable for
any breach in its security and any breach could harm its reputation, reduce demand for its services or cause customers to terminate their relationships with the combined company. 

If the combined company's system produces inaccurate information, the combined company may experience customer dissatisfaction, customer loss, or both and be exposed to
lawsuits.

        Software
defects or inaccurate data may cause incorrect recording, reporting or display of information to the combined company's customers, their marketing partners or both. Inaccurate
information could cause the combined company's customers to over-pay or under-pay their marketing partners. As a result, the combined company could be held liable for any damages incurred by its
customers or their marketing partners. In addition, Be Free provides an optional payment service for its customers. Software defects and inaccurate data may cause the combined company to send payments
to the wrong party, in the wrong amounts, or on an untimely basis, any of which could cause liability for the combined company, lead to customer dissatisfaction, or both. The combined company's
services depend on complex software that it has internally developed or licensed from third parties. Software often contains defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions are
released, which can adversely affect performance or result in inaccurate data. The combined company may not discover software defects that affect its new or current services or enhancements until
after they are deployed. In addition, the combined company's services depend on its customers and their marketing partners supplying the combined company with data regarding contacts, performance and
sales. If the combined company is provided with erronious or incomplete data, it may produce inaccurate information. Although such inaccuracies may be neither the combined company's fault or
responsibility, the combined company may still experience customer dissatisfaction or loss as a result. 

The combined company may not be able to protect its technology from unauthorized use, which could diminish the value of its services, weaken its competitive position and reduce
its revenues.

        The
combined company protects its proprietary rights through a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to
establish and protect its proprietary rights. Third-party software providers could copy or otherwise obtain and use the combined company's technology without authorization or develop similar
technology independently which may infringe upon its proprietary rights. The combined company may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before its does so.
In addition, competitors may design around the combined company's technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign
countries. 

        ValueClick
and Be Free generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with their respective employees, consultants, vendor clients and corporate partners, and generally
controls access to and distribution of their technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use
ValueClick's or Be Free's services or technologies. Their precautions may not prevent misappropriation of their services or technologies, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law
enforcement practices may not protect their proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. 

If the combined company fails to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies, it could lose customer or advertising inventory.

        The
Internet advertising market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions and changing customer
demands. The introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products and services obsolete and
unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in research and development. The combined company's success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to enhance existing
solutions and to develop and introduce a variety of new solutions to address its customers' changing demands. For example, advertisers are increasingly requiring Internet advertising networks to have
the ability to deliver advertisements utilizing new formats that surpass stationary images and incorporate rich media, such as video and audio, interactivity, and more precise consumer targeting
techniques. ValueClick's system does not support some types of advertising formats, such as certain video and audio formats, and many of the Web sites in its network have not implemented systems to
allow rich media advertisements. In addition, an increase in the bandwidth of Internet access resulting in faster data delivery may provide new products and services that will take advantage of this
expansion in delivery capability. If the combined company fails to adapt successfully to developments such as these, it could lose customers or advertising inventory. ValueClick purchases most of the
software used in its business from third parties. ValueClick intends to continue to acquire technology necessary for it to conduct its business from third parties. ValueClick cannot assure you that,
in the future, these technologies will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The combined company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful
design, development, introduction or marketing of new solutions. Any new solution or enhancement that the combined company develops will need to meet the requirements of its current and prospective
customers and may not achieve significant market acceptance. If the combined company fails to keep pace with technological developments and the introduction of new industry and technology standards on
a cost-effective basis, its expenses could increase, and the combined company could lose customers or advertising inventory. 

Changes in government regulation and industry standards could decrease demand for the combined company's services and increase its costs of doing
business.

        Laws
and regulations that apply to Internet communications, commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent. These regulations could affect the costs of communicating on the Web and 

adversely affect the demand for the combined company's advertising solutions or otherwise harm its business, results of operations and financial condition. The United States Congress has enacted
Internet legislation regarding children's privacy, copyrights and taxation. Other laws and regulations may be adopted and may address issues such as user privacy, pricing, intellectual property
ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret, export of encryption technology, acceptable content, taxation and quality of products and services. This legislation could hinder growth
in the use of the Web generally and decrease the acceptance of the Web as a communications, commercial and advertising medium. 

        Legislation
has been proposed recently to prohibit the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail. ValueClick has a consent-based email delivery business that it believes
should not, as a matter of policy, be affected by this kind of legislation. However, it is possible that legislation will be passed that requires the combined company to change its current practices,
or subject the combined company to increased possibility of legal liability for its practices. 

        Due
to the global nature of the Web, it is possible that, although the combined company's transmissions originate in California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Japan, the
governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to its activities. In addition, the growth and development of the
market for Internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business
over the Internet. The laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. It may take years to determine how existing laws, including
those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, apply to the Internet and Internet advertising. The combined company's business, results of operations and financial condition could
be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet, or the application of existing laws to the Internet or Internet-based advertising. 

The combined company could be held liable for its or its clients' failure to comply with federal, state and foreign laws governing consumer privacy.

        Recent
growing public concern regarding privacy and the collection, distribution and use of information about Internet users has led to increased federal, state and foreign scrutiny and
legislative and regulatory activity concerning data collection and use practices. Any failure of the combined company to comply with applicable foreign, federal and state laws and regulatory
requirements of regulatory authorities may result in, among other things, indemnification liability to the combined company's clients and the advertising agencies it works with, administrative
enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits, cease and desist orders, and civil and criminal liability. Recently, class action lawsuits have been filed alleging violations of privacy laws by
Internet service providers. In October 1998, the European Union adopted a directive addressing data privacy that may result in limitations on the combined company's ability to collect and use
information regarding Internet users. These restrictions may limit the combined company's ability to target advertising in most European countries. The combined company's failure to comply with these
or other federal, state or foreign laws could result in liability and materially harm the combined company's business. 

        In
addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the high-technology and direct marketing industries are considering various new, additional or different
self-regulatory standards. This focus, and any legislation, regulations or standards promulgated, may impact the combined company adversely. Governments, trade associations and industry
self-regulatory groups may enact more burdensome laws, regulations and guidelines, including consumer privacy laws, affecting the combined company and its clients. Since many of the
proposed laws or regulations are just being developed, and a consensus on privacy and data usage has not been reached, ValueClick and Be Free cannot yet determine the impact these regulations may have
on its business. However, if the gathering of profiling 

information were to be curtailed, Internet advertising would be less effective, which would reduce demand for Internet advertising and harm the combined company's business. 

        The
combined company's customers are also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection and use of information regarding individuals. These laws include the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, the Federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act of 1994, the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as other laws that govern the collection and
use of consumer credit information. ValueClick and Be Free cannot assure you that their clients are currently in compliance, or will remain in compliance, with these laws and their own privacy
policies. The combined company may be held liable if its clients use its technology in a manner that is not in compliance with these laws or their own stated privacy standards.

THE VALUECLICK ANNUAL MEETING    

Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus  

        This document is being furnished to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by ValueClick's board of directors for the annual meeting of ValueClick's
stockholders. 

        This
joint proxy statement/prospectus is first being furnished to ValueClick stockholders on or about                        , 2002.

Date, Time and Place of the Annual Meeting  

        The annual meeting of ValueClick stockholders will be held as follows: 

                ,

10:00 a.m., local time

4360 Park Terrace Drive, Suite 100

Westlake Village, California 

Purpose of the Annual Meeting  

        The purpose of the ValueClick annual meeting is: 


To
approve the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 10, 2002, by and among
ValueClick, Inc., Bravo Acquisition I Corp. and Be Free, Inc.;


To
approve a proposal to amend and restate ValueClick's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of
common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000 shares;


To
elect nine members of the board of directors of ValueClick to serve until the next annual meeting of ValueClick stockholders and until their successors
have been elected and qualified;


To
permit ValueClick's board of directors or its chairman, in their discretion, to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting if necessary for further
solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the originally scheduled time of the annual meeting to approve each proposal; and


To
act upon such other matters as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. 

Stockholder Record Date for the Annual Meeting  

        ValueClick's board of directors has fixed the close of business on            , 2002 as the record date for determining which
ValueClick stockholders are
entitled to notice of and to vote at the ValueClick annual meeting. On the record date, there were                        shares
of ValueClick common stock outstanding, held by approximately                        
holders of record. 

Quorum; Vote Required for Each Proposal  

        A majority of the outstanding shares of ValueClick common stock must be represented either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the ValueClick annual
meeting. Proxies marked as abstentions and broker non-votes will be used in determining the number of shares present at the meeting. At the ValueClick annual meeting, each share of
ValueClick common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to the ValueClick stockholders. 

Proposal Number One
: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of ValueClick common stock voting on Proposal Number One
is required to approve the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. ValueClick stockholders should be aware that if the issuance of shares of ValueClick common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement is approved by ValueClick's stockholders but there are insufficient votes to approve Proposal Number Two below to amend and restate ValueClick's Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, ValueClick will not have enough shares of common stock to issue to Be Free stockholders in the merger and the merger cannot be completed. 

Proposal Number Two
: The approval of the proposal to amend and restate ValueClick's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to
increase the authorized number of shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of ValueClick common stock outstanding
as of the record date. 

        Even
though the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement and the proposal to amend the certificate of incorporation are
independent proposals and approval of one is not conditioned upon approval of the other, ValueClick cannot consummate the merger without approval of the proposal to amend its certificate of
incorporation. Therefore, if the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement is approved, but the amendment to the certificate of incorporation is not approved,
ValueClick's authorized shares will be increased even though ValueClick will not be able to consummate the merger and, therefore, will not be issuing any shares pursuant to the merger agreement. 

Proposal Number Three
: The nine director nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares of ValueClick
common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote, shall be elected as directors. 

Proposal Number Four
: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of ValueClick common stock voting on the
proposal is required to permit ValueClick's board of directors or its chairman, in their discretion, to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting if necessary to solicit further proxies. 

        Be
Free has entered into voting agreements with several directors, officers and stockholders of ValueClick that require these ValueClick stockholders to vote their shares of ValueClick
common stock in favor of the approval of the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement and the proposal to amend and restate ValueClick's Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation. As of the record date, the shares owned by these stockholders and subject to such voting agreements represented approximately          % of the voting power of
ValueClick capital stock entitled to vote at the ValueClick annual meeting. 

        The
directors and executive officers of ValueClick owned approximately    % of the outstanding shares of ValueClick common stock as of the record date, and each of them, with
the exception of one director who was absent, has indicated their intention to vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement or has entered into a voting agreement with Be Free as described
above. 

The ValueClick board of directors has approved, and recommends that the ValueClick stockholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal, the grant of discretionary authority to adjourn
the annual meeting for further solicitation of proxies, the amendment and restatement of its certificate of incorporation, and the election of the nine director nominees.

Proxies  

        All shares of ValueClick common stock represented by properly executed proxy cards received before or at the ValueClick annual meeting will, unless the proxies
are revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxy cards. If no instructions are indicated on a properly 

executed proxy card, the shares will be voted 
FOR
 the proposals. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card to indicate how to vote your shares. 

        If
a properly executed proxy card is returned and the stockholder has abstained from voting on one or more of the proposals, the ValueClick common stock represented by the proxy will be
considered present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted on the abstained proposals. 

        If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct them on how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank holding
shares which indicates that the broker or bank does not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposals, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted on the proposals. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the
information provided to you by your broker. 

        Abstentions,
failures to vote and broker non-votes at the annual meeting will have no effect on the proposals to approve the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement, to elect directors or to grant discretionary authority to ValueClick's board of directors or its chairman to adjourn the annual meeting to further solicit proxies.
Abstentions, failures to vote and broker non-votes for all other proposals, will have the same effect as a vote against that particular proposal at the ValueClick annual meeting. 

        You
may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by: 


notifying
in writing the Secretary of ValueClick, Inc. at 4360 Park Terrace Drive, Suite 100, Westlake Village, California 91361;


granting
a subsequently dated proxy; or


if
you are a holder of record, appearing in person and voting at the annual meeting. 

        Your
attendance at the annual meeting will not in and of itself revoke your proxy. 

        ValueClick
is not aware of any business to be acted on at the ValueClick annual meeting, except as described in this document. If any other matters are properly presented at the
ValueClick annual meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting, the persons appointed as proxies or their substitutes will have discretion to vote or act on the matter according
to their best judgment and applicable law unless the proxy indicates otherwise. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

        ValueClick will pay the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this document. ValueClick will also request banks, brokers and other
intermediaries holding shares of ValueClick common stock beneficially owned by others to send this document to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will, upon request, reimburse the
holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic means, advertisements and personal solicitation by
the directors, officers or employees of ValueClick. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for those solicitation efforts. 

        ValueClick
may engage one or more proxy solicitation firms to assist in obtaining proxies from its stockholders on a timely basis. As of the date of this document, ValueClick has not
engaged a proxy solicitation firm or has committed itself to the payment of any fees for this service.

Purpose of the Annual Meeting  

        The purpose of the Be Free annual meeting is:

To

Stockholder Record Date for the Annual Meeting  

        Be Free's board of directors has fixed the close of business
on                            , 2002 as the record date for determining which Be Free stockholders are
entitled to
notice of and to vote at the Be Free annual meeting. On the record date, there
were                            shares of Be Free common stock outstanding, held by
approximately                holders of record.

Quorum; Vote Required for Each Proposal  

        A majority of the outstanding shares of Be Free common stock must be represented, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the Be Free annual
meeting. Proxies marked as abstentions and broker non-votes will be used in determining the number of shares present at the meeting. At the Be Free annual meeting, each share of Be Free
common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters properly submitted to the Be Free stockholders. 

Proposal Number One
: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Be Free common stock outstanding as of the
record date is required to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. 

Proposal Number Two
: The two director nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares of Be Free common
stock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote, shall be elected as Class III directors. 

Proposal Number Three
: The board of directors has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Be Free's independent auditors for the
current fiscal year ending December 31, 2002. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP by a majority vote of the shares of Be Free common stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote, the selection of such auditors will be reconsidered by the Be Free board. 

Proposal Number Four
: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Be Free common stock voting on the
proposal is required to permit Be Free's board of directors or its chairman, in their discretion, to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting if necessary to solicit further proxies. 

        ValueClick
has entered into voting agreements with several directors, officers and stockholders of Be Free, that require these Be Free stockholders to vote their shares of Be Free common
stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. As of the record date, the shares owned by these stockholders and subject to such voting agreements represented
approximately        % of the voting power of Be Free capital stock entitled to vote at the Be Free annual meeting. 

        The
directors and executive officers of Be Free owned approximately        % of the outstanding shares of Be Free common stock as of the record date, and each of them has indicated
their intention to vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement or has entered into a voting agreement with ValueClick as described above. 

The Be Free board of directors unanimously recommends that the Be Free stockholders vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger,
the election of such director nominees, the ratification of the appointment of independent auditors and the grant of discretionary authority to adjourn the annual meeting for further solicitation of
proxies.

Proxies  

        Be Free stockholders may vote by returning the enclosed proxy card by mail, submitting an electronic proxy over the Internet or in person, at the annual meeting.
All shares of Be Free common stock represented by properly executed proxy cards received before or at the Be Free annual meeting and all proxies properly submitted over the Internet will, unless
revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxy cards or Internet submissions. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy, the shares will be voted 

FOR

the proposals. You are urged to mark the box on the proxy card or Internet submission to indicate how to vote your shares.

        If
a properly executed proxy card is returned or properly submitted over the Internet and the stockholder has abstained from voting on one or more of the proposals, the Be Free common
stock represented by the proxy will be considered present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted on the abstained proposals. 

        If
your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct them on how to vote your shares. If an executed proxy card is returned by a broker or bank holding
shares which indicates that the broker or bank does not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposals, the shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted on the proposals. Your broker or bank will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the
information provided to you by your broker. 

        Abstentions,
failures to vote and broker non-votes for the merger proposal will have the same effect as a vote against the merger proposal at the Be Free annual meeting but
will have no effect on the election of directors, the ratification of the appointment of independent auditors or the proposal to grant discretionary authority to Be Free's board of directors or its
chairman to adjourn the annual meeting to further solicit proxies. 

        You
may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by: 


notifying
in writing the Secretary of Be Free, Inc. at 154 Crane Meadow Road, Marlborough, Massachusetts 01752;


granting
a subsequently dated proxy; or


if
you are a holder of record, appearing in person and voting at the annual meeting. 

        Your
attendance at the annual meeting will not in and of itself revoke your proxy. 

        Be
Free is not aware of any business to be acted on at the Be Free annual meeting, except as described in this document. If any other matters are properly presented at the Be Free annual
meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting, the persons appointed as proxies or their substitutes will have discretion to vote or act on the matter according to their best
judgment and applicable law unless the proxy indicates otherwise. 

Appraisal Rights  

        Under Delaware law, Be Free's stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

Solicitation of Proxies  

        ValueClick and Be Free will each pay one-half of the expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this document. Be Free will also request
banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of Be Free common stock beneficially owned by others to send this document to, and obtain proxies from, the beneficial owners and will, upon
request, reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram and other electronic means, advertisements and
personal solicitation by the directors, officers or employees of Be Free. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or employees for those solicitation efforts. 

        Be
Free may engage one or more proxy solicitation firms to assist in obtaining proxies from its stockholders on a timely basis. As of the date of this document, Be Free has not engaged a
proxy solicitation firm or has committed itself to the payment of any fees for this service. 

You should not send in any stock certificates with your proxy card. If you are a Be Free stockholder, a transmittal letter with instructions for the surrender of
your Be Free stock certificates will be mailed to you as soon as practicable after completion of the merger.

PROPOSAL NUMBER ONE    

VALUECLICK STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES
  OF VALUECLICK COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

BE FREE STOCKHOLDER ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT
  AND APPROVAL OF THE MERGER    

        In Proposal Number One, ValueClick stockholders are being asked to approve the issuance of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Approval of
the issuance of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of ValueClick common stock voting on Proposal Number One.
ValueClick does not currently have enough authorized but unissued shares of common stock to complete the merger. In Proposal Number Two, ValueClick stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment
to ValueClick's certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000. Approval of the amendment to ValueClick's certificate of
incorporation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of ValueClick common stock outstanding as of the record date. Even though Proposals Number One and Two are
independent proposals and approval of one is not conditioned upon approval of the other, ValueClick cannot consummate the merger without approval of Proposal Number Two. Therefore, if Proposal Number
One is approved, but Proposal Number Two is not approved by ValueClick's stockholders, the merger will not be completed. Conversely, if Proposal Number Two is approved by ValueClick's stockholders,
but Proposal Number One is not approved, ValueClick's authorized shares will be increased, even though ValueClick will not be able to consummate the merger and, therefore, will not be issuing any
shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. 

This section describes material aspects of the proposed merger. While we believe that the description covers the material terms of the merger, this summary may
not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should read this entire document, including the annexes, carefully for a more complete understanding of the merger and the terms of the
merger agreement.

General Description of the Merger  

        At the effective time, Bravo Acquisition I Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ValueClick, will be merged with and into Be Free. Be Free will be the surviving
corporation and will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ValueClick. As a result of the merger, each share of Be Free common stock outstanding at the effective time will be converted
automatically into 0.65882 of a share of ValueClick common stock, with cash paid for any fractional share. 

        Based
on the number of shares of Be Free common stock and ValueClick common stock outstanding as of the record date and the exchange ratio, approximately            shares of
ValueClick common stock will be issuable pursuant to the merger agreement, representing approximately 45% of the ValueClick common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately after the
merger. Based on shares of Be Free common stock underlying its outstanding stock options as of the record date and the exchange ratio, options to purchase approximately            additional
shares of ValueClick common stock will be assumed by ValueClick in the merger. This assumes that none of Be Free's stock options are exercised between the record date and the effective time. 

Background of the Merger  

        In connection with ValueClick's long-term strategic plans involving growth through strategic alliances, investments, acquisitions or business
combinations, ValueClick's management has been searching for and evaluating strategic acquisition candidates since 2000, and ValueClick has acquired five companies in the past two years, most recently
Mediaplex in October 2001. As a part of this 

process, ValueClick's management, at a meeting of its board of directors on October 26, 2001, identified Be Free as a company with strategic assets that fit into ValueClick's growth strategy.
While ValueClick's management considered other potential acquisition candidates before it agreed to acquire Be Free, discussions with those candidates led ValueClick's management to conclude that a
business combination with those candidates would not be in the best interest of ValueClick and its stockholders at that time for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition and operating
performance of the these candidates and potential challenges in integrating those candidates with ValueClick. By contrast, ValueClick's management decided to pursue the Be Free transaction because of
the potential synergies between the two companies, the economic terms of the combination and the complimentary nature of the existing customer relationships of the two companies. 

        Since
the closing of Be Free's public offering in March 2000, Be Free's management has pursued a strategy of broadening the products and services that it offers to its customers.
While Be Free believes that it offers very competitive e-marketing services, its management believes that a broader suite of products and services would offer greater prospects for growth
and profitability. To achieve this strategy, Be Free's management has evaluated a significant number of potential acquisitions or business
combinations. The combination with ValueClick was viewed as an opportunity to provide a much more robust suite of products and services than Be Free would be able to provide as a separate entity in
the near term, even assuming it was able to identify and close on desirable acquisition candidates. 

        The
following is a chronology of the meetings and events leading up to the agreement with Be Free: 

        On
November 27, 2001, ValueClick's chairman and chief executive officer, James Zarley, contacted Be Free's chief executive officer, Gordon Hoffstein, and held a telephone conversation to
discuss each company's corporate development program and overall business strategy. Messrs. Zarley and Hoffstein also discussed generally the possibility of a strategic transaction between
ValueClick and Be Free, and agreed to meet in person to discuss further the respective companies' businesses, future plans and possibility of a transaction. 

        In
late November 2001, Mr. Hoffstein discussed with individual Be Free directors and with Stephen M. Joseph, the chief financial officer of Be Free, the possibility of
pursuing a strategic combination with ValueClick. 

        On
December 6, 2001, ValueClick and Be Free executed a non-disclosure agreement. 

        On
December 6, 2001, Mr. Zarley and Samuel Paisley, ValueClick's chief operating officer, met with Messrs. Hoffstein and Joseph in Chicago, Illinois.
Messrs. Hoffstein and Zarley presented details relating to their respective companies' customers, revenue streams, personnel, technology platforms, ownership, board membership, management team,
financial strength, competitive position and operating performance. Strategic advantages of combining the two companies were discussed including potential increases in scale of business, broader
marketing solutions for an expanded customer base, potential for enhanced profitability and greater financial strength. Possible approaches for structuring and implementing a transaction as well as
potential terms were also discussed. 

        On
December 10, 2001, Mr. Zarley submitted a non-binding term sheet to Be Free and discussed the document with Mr. Hoffstein. Over the next four days,
the companies' respective legal advisors and senior executives discussed the term sheet, and both companies agreed to begin negotiating a merger agreement and to commence detailed due diligence. 

        On
December 17, 2001, ValueClick and Be Free, together with their respective legal, financial and accounting advisors, began discussing a potential timetable for a business
combination as well as the general terms of the merger agreement and other related agreements. On December 19, 2001, ValueClick's legal counsel provided an initial draft of the merger and
voting agreements, and the parties began to exchange due diligence information. From December 19, 2001 until January 10, 2002, 

ValueClick and Be Free and their respective financial, legal and accounting advisors, each conducted business, financial and legal due diligence reviews, and negotiated the terms of the merger
agreement and related documents. 

        On
December 27, 2001, the Be Free board of directors held a telephonic meeting. Mr. Joseph and representatives of Hale and Dorr LLP, Be Free's legal counsel, also attended.
At that meeting, management outlined the rationale for, as well as the general structure and potential terms of, a business combination with ValueClick. Management also reviewed public information
about ValueClick sent to directors in advance of the meeting and Hale and Dorr LLP reviewed the terms of the current drafts of the merger agreement and related documents. Management and legal counsel
were instructed to continue exploring the proposed business combination. 

        On
January 9, 2002, Mr. Joseph met with Messrs. Zarley and Paisley in ValueClick's offices in San Francisco, California. They reviewed the potential cost synergies
that might be expected to result from a business combination. 

        From
January 9 through January 14, 2002, Messrs. Zarley and Hoffstein had periodic telephone conversations discussing the terms of the merger agreement, including
the proposed exchange ratio. On January 14, 2002, Messrs. Zarley and Hoffstein agreed to suspend further due diligence activities and negotiations of the agreements among the parties'
respective professional advisors pending their respective announcement of financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2001. 

        On
February 7, 2002, Be Free's board of directors held its regularly scheduled meeting. During this meeting, Mr. Hoffstein reported on the prior negotiations with
ValueClick. 

        On
February 14, 2002, ValueClick's board of directors held its regularly scheduled meeting, at which Messrs. Zarley and Paisley updated the board as to the status of the
discussions between Messrs. Zarley and Hoffstein. The board encouraged Messrs. Zarley and Paisley to continue their efforts to reach an agreement with Be Free as to the terms of a
proposed merger. 

        From
February 14 through February 25, 2002, Messrs. Zarley and Hoffstein had further telephone conversations discussing the terms of a potential merger. 

        On
February 28, 2002, the Be Free board of directors met in Marlborough, Massachusetts and all directors were present in person or by telephone. Messrs. Joseph, Zarley and
Paisley, as well as representatives of Hale and Dorr LLP were also present. Messrs. Zarley and Paisley presented ValueClick's corporate development program and overall business strategy and
their views as to the
strategic advantages of combining ValueClick and Be Free. After Messrs. Zarley and Paisley left the meeting, management and legal counsel reviewed the proposed terms of the merger agreement and
related documents that had not as yet been settled. The board of directors authorized management and legal counsel to resume negotiations with ValueClick. After the board meeting,
Messrs. Zarley and Paisley met with Messrs. Hoffstein and Joseph to discuss the terms of the merger and mutually agreed to resume due diligence activities and engage, together with their
respective legal, financial and accounting advisors, in negotiations to conclude the terms of the merger agreement and other related agreements. 

        On
March 1, 2002, ValueClick's board of directors held a telephonic meeting to consider the proposed merger with Be Free. Messrs. Zarley and Paisley reviewed with the board the history
and background of discussions with Be Free, the strategic reasons for the merger and other considerations, as well as the status of negotiations with Be Free's management. After further discussions,
ValueClick's board of directors directed Messrs. Zarley and Paisley to continue negotiations with Be Free. 

        From
March 1, 2002 until March 10, 2002, ValueClick and Be Free and their respective financial, legal and accounting advisors each completed business, financial and legal
due diligence reviews and finalized the terms of the merger agreements and related documents. 

        On
March 8, 2002, ValueClick's board of directors held a telephonic meeting to review the terms of the merger with Be Free. Ira Carlin, one of ValueClick's directors, did
not attend this meeting. Representatives of ValueClick's senior management, Salomon Smith Barney Inc., ValueClick's financial advisor, and Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, ValueClick's
legal counsel, also attended. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP made a presentation to the members of ValueClick's board of directors regarding their legal duties and responsibilities in
connection with considering the merger, and discussed the principal terms of the merger agreement and related agreements. Mr. Zarley, led the board in a discussion of ValueClick's and Be Free's
businesses, the risks and opportunities facing the companies and the strategic reasons for the merger. ValueClick's board of directors reviewed and discussed the status of the negotiations, including
the terms of the merger agreement, the final exchange ratio, termination fees, the opportunity to entertain alternative proposals and termination rights. Representatives of Salomon Smith Barney
presented an analysis of the financial terms of the proposed transaction and discussed, among other things, ValueClick's and Be Free's financial performance and the fairness, from a financial point of
view, of the proposed exchange ratio to ValueClick's stockholders. 

        Also
on March 8, 2002, Be Free's board of directors met to review the terms of the merger with ValueClick. All of the directors were present by telephone. Mr. Joseph and
representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, Be Free's financial advisor, and Hale and Dorr LLP also attended. At this meeting, Mr. Hoffstein reviewed the proposed terms of the
merger with the board, including the strategic reasons for the merger, the principal financial terms and ValueClick's financial condition and business operations. Mr. Hoffstein also reviewed
management's views as to Be Free's prospects as an
independent entity and past efforts to identify acquisition candidates or other strategic partners to execute on management's strategy to expand the products and services offered by Be Free. 

        Hale
and Dorr LLP discussed the board's fiduciary duties in considering a strategic business combination such as the proposed merger with ValueClick and further discussed the terms of
the merger agreement and the related documents. Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed with Be Free's board of directors its financial analysis of the exchange ratio provided in the proposed merger and
informed Be Free's board of directors that, subject to review of the definitive merger agreement and assuming no material changes in matters relating to the proposed merger, it would be in a position
to deliver an opinion, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of Be Free common stock. 

        After
reviewing materials provided at the March 8, 2002 board meeting, ValueClick's board of directors met again on March 10, 2002 to consider and approve the terms of the
merger with Be Free. All directors, other than Mr. Carlin were present by telephone. ValueClick's senior management and representatives of Salomon Smith Barney and Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison
LLP, also attended. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP confirmed that there had been no substantive changes to the terms of the merger as described in the previous board meeting. Salomon Smith
Barney delivered its oral opinion to ValueClick's board of directors, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 10, 2002, that the exchange ratio of ValueClick
common stock for Be Free common stock in the proposed merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to ValueClick's stockholders. The board of directors reviewed with ValueClick's senior
management the status of final negotiations and discussed the opinion of Salomon Smith Barney. After further discussions and deliberations, ValueClick's board of directors approved, by a vote of 8 in
favor and none opposed, the merger agreement and related agreements and the transactions contemplated by those agreements, declared them advisable and resolved to recommend that ValueClick's
stockholders approve the merger agreement. 

        Also
on March 10, 2002, Be Free's board of directors met to consider the merger agreement and the related documents. All directors were present by telephone as were
Mr. Joseph and representatives of Credit Suisse First Boston and Hale and Dorr LLP. Hale and Dorr LLP reviewed the changes in the 

merger agreement from the form presented at the March 8, 2002 meeting. Credit Suisse First Boston delivered to Be Free's board of directors its oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated March 10, 2002, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Be Free common stock. After further discussions and deliberation, the Be Free board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and
the related documents and the transactions contemplated by those agreements, declared them advisable and resolved to recommend that Be Free's stockholders adopt the merger agreement. 

        On
March 10, 2002, Be Free and ValueClick entered into the definitive merger agreement. In connection with the merger agreement, some of ValueClick's executive officers and some
of ValueClick's directors and shareholders entered into voting agreements with Be Free, and some
executive officers and some directors of Be Free entered into voting agreements with ValueClick. On March 11, 2002, Be Free and ValueClick issued a joint press release announcing the signing of
the merger agreement. 

ValueClick's Reasons for the Merger  

        ValueClick's board of directors believes that the following potential benefits of the merger will contribute to ValueClick's success: 


ValueClick
would acquire Be Free's BFAST partner marketing service, BSELECT
SM
 Onsite site personalization service, Adaptive
Relationship Modeling (ARM) technology, and other critical technologies;


ValueClick
would gain the ability to offer complementary product lines and improved product offerings;


ValueClick
would benefit from Be Free's technical, engineering, management and sales expertise, which are in high demand and short supply;


ValueClick
would gain the ability to integrate technological resources to develop new products with increased functionality and bring them to market faster
than either ValueClick or Be Free would do on its own;


ValueClick
would gain the ability to commit greater resources to both current and emerging product development efforts and fund the future growth of its
business; and


ValueClick
would gain access to Be Free's customers and entry into a new strategic market segment. 

        ValueClick's
board of directors reviewed a number of factors in evaluating the merger, including, but not limited to, the following: 


information
concerning ValueClick's and Be Free's respective businesses, prospects, business plans, financial performance and condition, results of
operations, technology positions, management and competitive positions;


the
due diligence investigation conducted by ValueClick's management and legal and accounting advisors;


ValueClick
management's view of the positive results of combining the operations and businesses of ValueClick and Be Free;


the
terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, including price and structure, which were considered by both the ValueClick board of directors and
management of ValueClick to provide a fair and equitable basis for the merger; 


a
detailed presentation by representatives of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. regarding the financial aspects of the proposed merger, including the ratio
for exchanging shares of ValueClick common stock;


the
opinion of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. that the exchange ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of ValueClick common stock;


the
current financial market conditions and historical stock market prices, volatility and trading information; and


the
impact of the merger on ValueClick's customers and employees. 

        The
ValueClick board of directors also considered a number of potentially negative factors, including, but not limited to: 


the
risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be fully realized;


the
risk that, despite the efforts of ValueClick and Be Free, key technical, sales and management personnel might not remain employees of the combined
company following the merger;


the
effect of the public announcement of the merger on Be Free's business, including a disruption of Be Free's customer relationships if the customers defer
purchasing decisions as they evaluate the likelihood of successful integration of ValueClick's and Be Free's products and the combined company's future strategy;


the
risks associated with obtaining the necessary approvals required to complete the merger, including inability to obtain stockholder approval or conditions
imposed by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission that could harm the combined company's business;


the
potential negative effect on ValueClick's stock price associated with public announcement of the proposed merger;


the
possibility that the merger might not be completed, and the fact that under some circumstances ValueClick would be required to pay a termination fee to
Be Free; and


the
other risks and uncertainties discussed above under "Risk Factors." 

        The
foregoing discussion is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors considered by the ValueClick board of directors. The ValueClick board of
directors did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors considered. In addition, the ValueClick board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion on each factor
considered, or any aspect of any particular factor, but conducted an overall analysis of these factors. Individual members of the ValueClick board of directors may have given different weight to
different factors. After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, the ValueClick board of directors concluded that the merger agreement and the merger were advisable, and in the best
interests of ValueClick and its stockholders and that ValueClick should proceed with the merger. 

Recommendation of ValueClick's Board Of Directors  

        After careful consideration, the ValueClick board of directors, on March 10, 2002, determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the merger are
advisable, and in the best interest of, ValueClick and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the merger. The ValueClick board of directors recommends that the stockholders of
ValueClick vote 
"FOR"
 the approval of the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. 

        In
considering the recommendation of the ValueClick board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, the ValueClick stockholders should be aware that some directors and executive 

officers of ValueClick will receive benefits if the merger is completed which results in those persons having interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of
ValueClick stockholders. Please see "Conflicts of Interests of ValueClick Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" on page       of this document. 

Opinion of Salomon Smith Barney Inc.  

        Salomon Smith Barney has acted as the financial advisor to ValueClick in connection with the merger. On March 8, 2002, Salomon Smith Barney reviewed its
presentation with the ValueClick board of directors and delivered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, on March 10, 2002, that as of such date and based upon and subject to the
factors and assumptions set forth in the presentation, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of ValueClick common stock. 

The full text of the written opinion which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed and matters considered by Salomon Smith Barney is set forth as
Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and ValueClick stockholders are urged to read Salomon Smith Barney's opinion in its entirety. The summary of the opinion as set forth in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

        The
opinion and presentation of Salomon Smith Barney to the ValueClick board of directors, in connection with which Salomon Smith Barney was requested to evaluate the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of ValueClick common stock, was only one of many factors taken into consideration by the ValueClick board of directors in making its
determination to approve the merger. No limitations were imposed by the ValueClick board of directors upon Salomon Smith Barney with respect to the investigation made or the procedures followed by
Salomon Smith Barney in rendering its opinion. 

        Salomon
Smith Barney's opinion should be read carefully and in its entirety. It is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of
ValueClick common stock, and it does not address the underlying business decision of ValueClick to effect the merger or constitute a recommendation to any ValueClick stockholder as to how such holder
should vote with respect to the merger. It also does not constitute an opinion or imply any conclusion of Salomon Smith Barney as to what the value of the ValueClick common stock actually will be when
issued pursuant to the merger or the price at which ValueClick common stock will trade following the announcement or completion of the merger, which may vary. 

        In
connection with rendering its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney reviewed selected publicly available business and financial information concerning ValueClick and Be Free as well as
financial forecasts that were provided to Salomon Smith Barney by ValueClick and Be Free, respectively. Salomon Smith Barney discussed the business, operations and prospects of ValueClick and Be Free,
as well as other matters it believed relevant to its inquiry, with officers and employees of ValueClick and Be Free, respectively. Salomon Smith Barney also considered such other information,
analyses, strategic considerations, investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that it deemed appropriate. 

        In
its review and analysis and in arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney assumed and relied upon, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the financial and other information reviewed by Salomon Smith Barney. With respect to the financial forecasts of ValueClick and Be Free, Salomon Smith Barney assumed that they had
been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the respective managements of ValueClick and Be Free as to the future financial performance of
ValueClick and Be Free, respectively, and Salomon Smith Barney expressed no opinion with respect to such forecasts or the assumptions on which such forecasts were based. Salomon Smith Barney also
assumed that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and the other 

agreements entered into in conjunction with the merger. Salomon Smith Barney did not make or assume any responsibility for making or obtaining any independent evaluations or appraisals of any of the
assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of ValueClick or Be Free. Salomon Smith Barney's opinion is necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of its
opinion. 

        In
connection with rendering its opinion to the ValueClick board of directors, Salomon Smith Barney performed several financial analyses which it presented to the ValueClick board of
directors, the material portions of which are summarized below. Salomon Smith Barney believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of such analyses and the
factors it considered, without considering all such analyses and factors, could create an incomplete view of the analyses and the process underlying its opinion. While the conclusions reached in
connection with each analysis were considered carefully by Salomon Smith Barney in arriving at its opinion, Salomon Smith Barney made various subjective judgments in arriving at its opinion and did
not consider it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, assign relative weights to the individual analyses and specific factors considered in reaching its opinion. 

        The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In addition, the process of preparing a fairness
opinion necessarily requires a broad range of subjective judgments with respect to appropriate comparable companies, appropriate multiples of various selected financial data and other financial and
other factors. Analyses and estimates of the values of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or their securities actually may be sold. The
range of implied exchange ratios or implied multiples for any particular analysis should not be taken to be the view of Salomon Smith Barney of the actual exchange ratios or multiples of ValueClick or
Be Free. 

        The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Salomon Smith Barney in connection with providing its opinion to the ValueClick board of directors. Several of the
summaries below include information presented in tabular format. In order to understand fully such financial analyses used by Salomon Smith Barney, the tables must be read with the text of each
summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. 

ValueClick and Be Free Valuation Analysis  

        Salomon Smith Barney derived implied exchange ratios and implied multiples for ValueClick and Be Free by using three principal valuation methodologies: a relative
valuation analysis, a historical exchange ratio analysis and a comparable company analysis. A relative valuation analysis analyzes certain financial data to determine the relative contribution of each
company to the pro forma combined entity. Historical exchange ratio analysis compares the exchange ratio of the proposed transaction to the historical implied per share exchange ratio of the two
companies over selected intervals of time. Comparable company analysis analyzes a business' operating performance and outlook relative to a group of publicly traded peer companies. No public company
used in the comparable company analysis is identical to ValueClick or Be Free. Accordingly, any analysis of publicly traded comparable companies is not mathematical; rather, it involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the public trading multiple of the
companies or company to which they are being compared. 

        (1)    
Relative Valuation Analysis
. Salomon Smith Barney analyzed the relative contributions of ValueClick and Be Free to the
pro forma combined entity with respect to gross profit (defined as revenues less cost of goods sold) and cash balance for selected periods, the resulting implied exchange ratio of a share of
ValueClick common stock to a share of Be Free common stock and the implied offer premium (or discount) to holders of Be Free common stock as compared to the exchange ratio of 

 .65882x of a share of ValueClick common stock for each share of Be Free common stock as provided in the merger agreement:

        Salomon
Smith Barney is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that regularly engages in the valuation of companies and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, and corporate, estate and other purposes. ValueClick retained Salomon Smith Barney
as a financial advisor because of its reputation, expertise in the valuation of companies and substantial experience in transactions such as the merger. 

        Pursuant
to the terms of Salomon Smith Barney's engagement, ValueClick agreed to pay Salomon Smith Barney a customary fee upon the written delivery of the fairness opinion and upon
completion of the merger. Additionally, ValueClick has agreed to reimburse Salomon Smith Barney for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
fees and expenses of Salomon Smith Barney's legal counsel. ValueClick has also agreed to indemnify Salomon Smith Barney and related persons against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws, related to or arising out of its engagement. In the ordinary course of its business, Salomon Smith Barney may actively trade the 

securities of ValueClick and Be Free for its own account and the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. 

Be Free's Reasons for the Merger  

        On March 10, 2002, the Be Free board of directors voted unanimously to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. The board also: 


determined
that the merger agreement and the merger were advisable, and in the best interests of, Be Free and its stockholders;


directed
that the merger proposal be submitted for consideration by the Be Free stockholders; and


recommended
that Be Free stockholders vote 
"FOR"
 the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the
merger. 

        In
evaluating the merger, Be Free's board of directors identified several potential benefits of the merger, the most important of which included the board's expectation that: 


following
the merger the combined company would have significant scale over a much broader suite of electronic marketing products and services than either Be
Free or ValueClick could offer on its own, thereby creating a more effective competitor;


the
combined company's revenues and financial position, especially its cash resources, would enhance its profile to customers and potential investors and
better enable it to compete for acquisitions to further expand the products and services it can offer to customers; and


the
combined company will have a more diverse and international customer base than Be Free which should present growth opportunities and better protection
against financial or economic contractions that affect only certain types of customers or geographic areas. 

        In
the course of reaching its decision to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger, Be Free's board of directors consulted with Be Free's management, as well as its legal,
financial and accounting advisors, and considered the following material factors: 


Be
Free and its customers would gain access to ValueClick's performance-based product line, proprietary ad-serving and reporting technology,
various networks and customer base;


ValueClick
would be able to leverage Be Free's technology across ValueClick's international office network;


the
estimated cost synergies resulting from the merger should permit the combined company to be profitable before non-cash and non-recurring charges prior to
the end of 2002, making it one of the only net income positive companies in the electronic marketing industry;


the
increased market capitalization, cash resources and profitability of the combined company should increase its ability to attract institutional investors
and broader research coverage;


the
inability of Be Free to expand its product offerings, despite significant efforts over the past two years to identify and evaluate potential acquisition
targets for Be Free;


the
fact that ValueClick had experience integrating businesses gained through five prior acquisitions;


the
combined company would have the ability to combine technological resources to develop new products with increased functionality and bring them to market
faster than either of ValueClick or Be Free would on its own; 


the
judgment, advice and analyses of Be Free management with respect to the potential strategic, financial and operational benefits of the merger, including
Be Free management's favorable recommendation of the merger, based in part on the business, technical, financial, accounting and legal investigations performed with respect to ValueClick;


the
terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, including price and structure, which were considered by both the Be Free board of directors and the
management of Be Free to provide a fair and equitable basis for the merger;


the
opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, dated March 10, 2002, that as of such date and based on and subject to the matters and
limitations set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Be Free common stock, and the financial presentation made on March 8, 2002,
by Credit Suisse First Boston to the Be Free board of directors; and


the
transaction with ValueClick provided greater value to Be Free stockholders than other alternatives, including a liquidation. 

        The
Be Free board of directors also considered a number of negative factors, including: 


the
risk of diverting management resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters for an extended period of time;


the
negative impact of confusion by customers and suppliers, which may occur after the announcement of the proposed merger;


the
combined company would still be focused in the electronic marketing segment, an area that had experienced especially significant cuts resulting from
customer budget reductions in the advertising and marketing area generally;


the
substantial accounting charges that will be incurred if the merger occurs, including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses arising
from the merger;


the
general difficulties of integrating products, technologies and companies;


the
difficulty of managing operations in more locations, especially where they are geographically dispersed;


the
possibility of cultural conflicts between the two companies; and


the
possibility that the merger might not be completed, and the fact that under some circumstances Be Free would be required to pay a termination fee to
ValueClick. 

        The
purchase price that Be Free stockholders will receive in the merger is less than the cash per share value of Be Free. Be Free agreed to a purchase price that is less than its cash
per share value because it believed that the stock market was currently over-discounting the Internet advertising companies such as ValueClick that trade on the Nasdaq National Market.
This over-discount of ValueClick's stock was evidenced by the fact that its stock was trading at a price less than its cash per share value. Additionally, the Be Free board believed that
upon any liquidation it would be required to settle customer obligations that, along with greater losses anticipated to be realized once any decision to liquidate was announced, would reduce
significantly the amount of cash that could be available for distribution to its stockholders upon any liquidation. 

        The
foregoing discussion of information and factors considered by the Be Free board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all material factors
considered by the Be Free board of directors. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger and the complexity of these matters, the Be Free board
of directors did not find it useful to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to these 

factors. In addition, the Be Free board of directors did not reach any specific conclusion on each factor considered, or any aspect of any particular factor, but conducted an overall analysis of
these factors. Individual members of the Be Free board of directors may have given different weight to different factors. After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, the Be Free
board of directors unanimously agreed that the merger agreement and the merger were fair to, and in the best interest of, Be Free and its stockholders and that Be Free should proceed with the Merger. 

Recommendation of Be Free's Board of Directors  

        After careful consideration, the Be Free board of directors, on March 10, 2002, unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the
merger are advisable, and in the best interest of, Be Free and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the merger. In reaching its decision, the Be Free board of directors consulted
with its management team and advisors and independently considered the proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Be Free board of directors unanimously
recommends that the stockholders of Be Free vote 
"FOR"
 the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger. 

        In
considering the recommendation of the Be Free board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, the Be Free stockholders should be aware that some of Be Free's directors and
executive officers will receive benefits if the merger is completed which results in those persons having interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Be
Free stockholders. Please see "Conflicts of Interests of Be Free Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page       of this document. 

Opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation  

        Credit Suisse First Boston has acted as Be Free's exclusive financial advisor in connection with the merger. Be Free selected Credit Suisse First Boston based on
Credit Suisse First Boston's experience, expertise and reputation, and its familiarity with Be Free and its business. Credit Suisse First Boston is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings, secondary
distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. 

        In
connection with Credit Suisse First Boston's engagement, Be Free requested that Credit Suisse First Boston evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Be
Free common stock of the exchange ratio provided for in the merger. On March 10, 2002, at a meeting of the Be Free board of directors held to evaluate the merger, Credit Suisse First Boston
rendered to the Be Free board of directors an oral opinion, which opinion was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated March 10,
2002, the date of the merger agreement, to the effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Be Free common stock. 

The full text of Credit Suisse First Boston's written opinion, dated March 10, 2002, to the Be Free board of directors, which sets forth the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex C and is incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. Holders of
Be Free common stock are encouraged to read this opinion carefully in its entirety. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion is addressed to the Be Free board of directors and relates only to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio, does not address any other aspect of the proposed merger or any related transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to any matter relating to the merger. The summary of Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the opinion.

        In
arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the merger agreement and publicly available business and financial information relating to Be Free and ValueClick. Credit
Suisse First Boston also reviewed other information relating to Be Free and ValueClick, including financial forecasts, provided to or discussed with Credit Suisse First Boston by Be Free and
ValueClick and met with the management of Be Free and ValueClick to discuss the businesses and prospects of Be Free and ValueClick. Credit Suisse First Boston considered financial and stock market
data of Be Free and ValueClick, and compared those data with similar data for publicly held companies in businesses similar to those of Be Free and ValueClick and considered, to the extent publicly
available, the financial terms of other business combinations and other transactions effected or announced. Credit Suisse First Boston also considered other information, financial studies, analyses
and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria that it deemed relevant. 

        In
connection with its review, Credit Suisse First Boston did not assume any responsibility for independent verification of any of the information that it reviewed or considered and
relied on that information being complete and accurate in all material respects. Credit Suisse First Boston was advised, and assumed, that the financial forecasts for Be Free and ValueClick were
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Be Free and ValueClick as to the future financial performance of Be Free and
ValueClick. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston relied on, without independent verification, the assessments of the management of Be Free and ValueClick as to Be Free's and ValueClick's existing
and future technology and products and the risks associated with such technology and products, the potential cost savings and synergies, including the amount, timing and achievability of those costs
savings and synergies, and strategic benefits anticipated by the management of Be Free and ValueClick to result from the merger, and Be Free's and ValueClick's ability to integrate their businesses
and to retain key employees. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston assumed, with Be Free's consent, that in the course of obtaining any necessary regulatory and third party approvals and consents
for the proposed merger, no modification, delay, limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on Be Free or ValueClick or the contemplated benefits
of the proposed merger. Credit Suisse First Boston also assumed, with Be Free's consent, that the merger would be treated as a tax-free
reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to, and did not, make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities, contingent or
otherwise, of Be Free or ValueClick, and Credit Suisse First Boston was not furnished with any evaluations or appraisals. 

        Credit
Suisse First Boston's opinion was necessarily based on information available to it, and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated, on
the date of Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion. Credit Suisse First Boston did not express any opinion as to what the value of ValueClick common stock actually would be when issued in the merger or
the prices at which ValueClick common stock would trade at any time. In connection with its engagement, Credit Suisse First Boston was requested to, and did, solicit third party indications of
interest from, and held discussions with, third parties regarding the possible acquisition of all or a part of Be Free. Although Credit Suisse First Boston evaluated the exchange ratio from a
financial point of view, Credit Suisse First Boston was not requested to, and did not, recommend the specific consideration payable in the merger, which consideration was determined between Be Free
and ValueClick. Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to other business strategies that might have been available to Be Free, and also did
not address the underlying business decision of Be Free to proceed with the merger. Except as described above, Be Free imposed no other limitations on Credit Suisse First Boston with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed in rendering its opinion. 

        In
preparing its opinion to the Be Free board of directors, Credit Suisse First Boston performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses, including those described below. The
summary of Credit 

Suisse First Boston's analyses described below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a fairness opinion is not
readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis
and factors that it considered. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on
information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying its analyses and opinion. 

        In
its analyses, Credit Suisse First Boston considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Be Free and ValueClick. No company, transaction or business used in Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses as a comparison is identical to Be Free, ValueClick or the proposed merger, and an
evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other
factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions analyzed. The estimates contained in Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses
and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, Credit Suisse First Boston's analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. 

        Credit
Suisse First Boston's opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Be Free board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed merger and should
not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Be Free board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the exchange ratio. 

        The
following is a summary of the material financial analyses underlying Credit Suisse First Boston's opinion dated March 10, 2002 delivered to the Be Free board of directors in
connection with the merger. 
The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Credit Suisse First Boston's
financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the
tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete
view of Credit Suisse First Boston's financial analyses.

        Contribution Analysis.
    Credit Suisse First Boston reviewed the relative contributions of Be Free and
ValueClick to the revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA, earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, commonly referred to as
EBITA and cash net income, excluding non-cash and one-time charges, of the combined company for each of actual calendar year 2001, which, in the case of ValueClick, was pro
forma for the acquisition of Mediaplex, Inc. and the divestiture of Exile on Seventh, LLC, and estimated calendar year 2002 based on two cases, the Management Case and the Street Case. The
Management Case was based on estimates of the management of Be Free and ValueClick. The Street Case was based on publicly available research analysts' estimates. Credit Suisse First Boston also
reviewed the relative contributions of Be Free and ValueClick to the fully diluted equity value and fully diluted enterprise value of the combined company, based on closing stock prices on
March 6, 2002, and the cash and net cash of the combined company as of December 31, 2001. Financial statistics that were not meaningful 

due to operating losses have been reflected as "NM." This analysis indicated the following, as compared to the fully diluted ownership percentage of Be Free's stockholders in the combined company
immediately upon consummation of the merger of approximately 45%:

        Pro Forma Impact Analysis.
    Credit Suisse First Boston analyzed the potential pro forma effect of the
merger on ValueClick's estimated cash earnings per share for estimated fiscal year 2002 based on estimates of the management of Be Free and ValueClick both before and after taking into account pretax
potential cost savings anticipated by the management of Be Free and ValueClick to result from the merger of approximately $6.2 million. Based on the merger exchange ratio of 0.65882x, this
analysis indicated that the merger could be: 


dilutive
to ValueClick's estimated cash earnings per share for estimated fiscal year 2002 before taking into account anticipated annual pretax potential cost
savings; and


accretive
to ValueClick's estimated cash earnings per share for estimated fiscal year 2002 after taking into account anticipated annual pretax potential cost
savings. 

        The
actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the variations may be material. 

        Other Factors.
    In the course of preparing its opinion, Credit Suisse First Boston also reviewed and
considered other information and data, including: 


publicly
available research analysts' reports for Be Free and ValueClick common stock, including earnings per share and revenue estimates;


historical
price performance and trading characteristics of Be Free common stock and ValueClick common stock and the relationship between movements in Be
Free common stock, movements in ValueClick common stock and movements in selected stock indices of related industries;


management
estimates of the implied per share equity value of Be Free assuming a liquidation of Be Free;


the
fully diluted ownership of Be Free stockholders in the combined company implied by the historical exchange ratios of Be Free common stock to ValueClick
common stock over various periods prior to March 6, 2002 as compared to the ownership implied by the exchange ratio in the merger of 0.65882x; and


the
purchase prices paid in selected recent merger transactions and the premium of the exchange ratio in the transactions to the ratio of the stock prices
for the acquirors and targets in the transactions over various periods prior to the announcement of the transaction. 

        Miscellaneous.
    Be Free has agreed to pay Credit Suisse First Boston customary fees for its financial
advisory services upon consummation of the merger. Be Free also has agreed to reimburse 

Credit Suisse First Boston for all out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel and any other advisor retained by Credit Suisse First Boston, and to
indemnify Credit Suisse First Boston and related parties against liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement. 

        Credit
Suisse First Boston and its affiliates in the past have provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking and financial services to Be Free unrelated to the proposed
merger, for which services Credit Suisse First Boston and its affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation. In the ordinary course of business, Credit Suisse First Boston and its
affiliates may actively trade the securities of Be Free or ValueClick for their own accounts and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions in those
securities. 

Conflicts of Interests of ValueClick Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger  

        In considering the recommendation of the ValueClick board of directors to vote for the merger proposal and to issue shares of ValueClick common stock pursuant to
the merger agreement, stockholders of ValueClick should be aware that some members of the ValueClick board of directors and some members of ValueClick's management team have agreements or arrangements
that provide them with benefits if the merger is completed and may result in those persons having interests in the merger that differ from those of ValueClick stockholders. The ValueClick board of
directors was aware of these agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of the merits of the merger and its determining to recommend to the ValueClick stockholders that they vote for the
proposal to approve the merger agreement. 

        Continued Service.
    All of ValueClick's executive officers will continue to be executive officers of ValueClick after the
merger. Five ValueClick directors will resign from the ValueClick board of directors and Messrs. Zarley,                  ,
                  and                  will continue as directors of
the combined
company after the merger. 

        Incentive Compensation.
    ValueClick's executive officers may be awarded incentive compensation based on the combined Company's
growth and operating results. 

Conflicts of Interests of Be Free Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger  

        In considering the recommendation of the Be Free board of directors to vote for the merger proposal and to adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger,
stockholders of Be Free should be aware that some members of the Be Free board of directors and some members of Be Free's management team have agreements or arrangements that provide them with
benefits if the merger is completed and may result in those persons having interests in the merger that differ from those of Be Free stockholders. The Be Free board of directors was aware of these
agreements and arrangements during its deliberations of the merits of the merger and its determining to recommend to the Be Free stockholders that they vote for the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and approve the merger. 

        Severance and Accelerated Vesting Arrangements for Mr. Hoffstein.
    Mr. Gordon B. Hoffstein is a party to an agreement
with Be Free pursuant to which he will be entitled to severance payments if he is involuntarily terminated prior to January 1, 2003. Pursuant to this agreement, if ValueClick terminates
Mr. Hoffstein's employment, involuntarily, significantly diminishes his duties and responsibilities or takes certain other actions, he would receive one year's base salary of $325,000,
potential bonus payments of up to $185,000 and continued medical insurance benefits for one year. Mr. Hoffstein is also party to agreements with Be Free pursuant to which the vesting of his
stock options and restricted stock will accelerate by 50% upon the consummation of the merger. As of mid-June 2002, such acceleration will
cause an aggregate of 322,469 options held by Mr. Hoffstein to vest, and an aggregate of 322,470 shares of restricted stock held by Mr. Hoffstein to vest and no longer be 

subject to Be Free's repurchase rights. In addition, all options to purchase Be Free common stock and restricted stock held by Mr. Hoffstein would vest in full if, within two years following
the merger, the company terminates his employment involuntarily, significantly diminishes his duties and responsibilities or takes certain other actions. 

        Accelerated Vesting of Outside Director Stock Options.
    Upon completion of the merger, the vesting of stock options granted to
Be Free's non-employee directors will accelerate. As of mid-June 2002, such acceleration will cause options held by Messrs. Dintersmith, Humphreys, Rayport and Ms. Biro to purchase an
aggregate of 104,374 shares of Be Free common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $10.91 to vest. 

        Accelerated Vesting of Employee Stock Options.
    Upon completion of the merger, the vesting of stock options granted to all
employees, including officers of Be Free, will accelerate. Most Be Free option agreements provide that the optionee will be entitled to one year of vesting credit upon the effectiveness of the merger.
If, within two years following the merger, the company terminates the employment of the optionee involuntarily, significantly diminishes his duties and responsibilities or takes certain other actions,
then the vesting of the option will accelerate in full. 

        Accelerated Vesting of Restricted Stock.
    Upon completion of the merger, the vesting of restricted stock granted to all
employees, including officers of Be Free will accelerate. Most Be Free restricted stock agreements provide that the number of shares subject to Be Free's repurchase right shall be reduced by 25% upon
the effectiveness of the merger. If, within two years following the merger, the company terminates the employment of the holder involuntarily, significantly diminishes his duties and responsibilities
or takes certain other actions, then all vesting will accelerate in full and the repurchase right will terminate. 

        Appointment to ValueClick Board of Directors.
    Upon the completion of the merger, three Be Free
directors,                 ,
                        and                 
       will become directors of ValueClick. 

        Employment after the Merger.
    Upon the completion of the merger, Gordon B. Hoffstein is expected to serve, during a transition
period, as the chief executive of the Be Free business, and Samuel P. Gerace, Jr. and Stephen M. Joseph, the Chief Technical Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, of Be Free are expected
to serve in similar capacities with ValueClick's Be Free business, in each case reporting to Mr. Zarley. 

        Indemnification and Insurance.
    The merger agreement provides that, upon completion of the merger, ValueClick will indemnify
and hold harmless, and pay all applicable expenses to, all past and present
directors and officers of Be Free and its subsidiaries in all of their capacities, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the merger: 


to
the same extent they were indemnified pursuant to Be Free's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements with any directors and
officers of Be Free and its subsidiaries; and


to
the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or omissions. 

        The
merger agreement also provides that, upon completion of the merger, for a period of six years after the completion of the merger, ValueClick will maintain in effect the existing
policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Be Free, or substitute for the current policy a policy or policies with comparable coverage; but ValueClick will not be required to
pay aggregate premiums for insurance in excess of 125% of the aggregate premiums paid by ValueClick for coverage of its directors and officers in the twelve-month period prior to the completion of the
merger. 

Completion and Effectiveness of the Merger  

        The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, including the approval of the issuance of shares of
ValueClick common stock pursuant to the merger agreement by the stockholders of ValueClick and the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger by the stockholders of Be Free. Unless
otherwise specified in the certificate of merger, the merger will become effective when the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 

        ValueClick
and Be Free are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. ValueClick and Be Free intend to complete the merger immediately after the stockholders of
ValueClick approve the issuance of shares of ValueClick common stock and the stockholders of Be Free adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger at their respective annual meetings. ValueClick
and Be Free expect to complete the merger by the end of the second quarter of 2002. 

Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger  

        The following discussion describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger generally applicable to the holders of Be Free common stock who
exchange Be Free common stock for
ValueClick common stock in the merger. This discussion addresses only those stockholders who hold Be Free common stock as a capital asset and will hold ValueClick common stock received in the merger
as a capital asset. 

        This
discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their individual circumstances or to stockholders
who hold their Be Free common stock as other than a capital asset, to stockholders that are subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance
companies, traders and dealers in securities, foreign stockholders, to stockholders who hold Be Free common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, or conversion transaction, to stockholders who acquired
Be Free common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, or to stockholders whose shares are qualified small business stock for purposes of
Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 

        The
following discussion is based upon the current provisions of the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations, judicial decisions and current administrative rulings, all of which are
subject to change and varying interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. Tax consequences under state, local, foreign and other laws are not addressed in this discussion. Each stockholder is
advised to consult his or her tax advisor as to the particular facts and circumstances which may be unique to that stockholder and also as to any estate, gift, state, local or foreign tax
considerations arising out of this merger. 

        Based
upon the assumptions and representations referred to in this discussion, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, counsel to ValueClick, has rendered an opinion to ValueClick and
Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel to Be Free, has rendered an opinion to Be Free, that the merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the
material federal income tax consequences to the Be Free stockholders of the exchange of their shares of Be Free common stock for shares of ValueClick common stock in the merger will be as described
below. In addition, it is a condition to the merger that ValueClick and Be Free receive an opinion from their respective counsel confirming their opinions that the merger will constitute a
reorganization. In the event that either ValueClick or Be Free waives this condition to the merger or there is a material change in the anticipated tax consequences of the merger prior to the closing,
the parties will recirculate this document and resolicit the vote of the Be Free stockholders. 

        The
tax opinions are conditioned upon the following: 


the
truth and accuracy of the statements, covenants, representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and related certificates received by
counsel from ValueClick and Be Free;


that
all covenants contained in the merger agreement will be performed without waiver or breach of any material provision; and


that
the merger will be duly effected under applicable state law and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. 

        Qualification
of the merger as a reorganization will result in the following federal income tax consequences to the Be Free stockholders: 

        Exchange of Be Free Common Stock for ValueClick Common Stock.
    A holder of Be Free common stock whose shares of Be Free common
stock are exchanged in the merger for ValueClick common stock will not recognize taxable gain or loss upon the exchange, except with respect to cash received in payment for a fractional share. The
aggregate tax basis of ValueClick common stock received by the holder will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of Be Free common stock that is exchanged, excluding any portion of the holder's basis
allocated to any fractional shares, and the holding period of ValueClick common stock received will include the holding period of Be Free common stock that is exchanged. 

        Cash For Fractional Shares.
    A holder of Be Free common stock who receives cash in lieu of a fractional shares of ValueClick
common stock will be treated as having received the fractional shares pursuant to the merger and then as having exchanged the fractional shares for cash in a redemption by ValueClick. The amount of
any gain or loss upon this deemed redemption will be equal to the difference between the ratable portion of the tax basis of Be Free common stock exchanged in the merger that is allocated to the
fractional share and the cash received for the fractional share. Any gain or loss will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if Be Free common stock has been held by the holder for
more than one year at the time of the consummation of the merger. 

        Reporting Requirements.
    Each holder of Be Free common stock that receives ValueClick common stock in the merger will be
required to retain records and file with the stockholder's federal income tax return a statement setting forth certain facts relating to the merger. 

        This
discussion constitutes the opinion of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP and Hale and Dorr LLP. No rulings have been or will be requested from the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to any of the matters addressed in this discussion. The tax opinions of counsel referred to herein will not bind the Internal Revenue Service, and the Internal Revenue Service may sustain a
position contrary to the tax opinions. A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the reorganization status of the merger would result in Be Free stockholders recognizing taxable gain or loss
with respect to each share of Be Free common stock surrendered equal to the difference between the stockholder's basis in the Be Free share and the fair market value, as of the effective time of the
merger, of the ValueClick common stock and any cash received in exchange therefor. In that case, a stockholder's aggregate basis in the ValueClick common stock so received would be equal to the fair
market value of the stock and the stockholder's holding period for such stock would begin the day after the merger. 

Accounting Treatment of the Merger  

        ValueClick intends to account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. 

Regulatory Matters  

        Antitrust Considerations.
    The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, which prevents specified transactions from being completed until required information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and
the Federal Trade Commission and specified waiting periods are terminated or expire. We have filed the required information and materials to notify the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission of the merger. We may not complete the merger until a thirty day waiting period after our filings expires. The government may extend the waiting period if it requests additional information
with respect to the merger. We have also asked that the waiting period be terminated early, and the government may grant our request in its discretion. 

        The
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds, either before or after expiration of the waiting
period. Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons could take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any time
before or after the completion of the merger, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period expired or was terminated, any state could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary
or desirable in the public interest, or other persons can take action under the antitrust laws. Additionally, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, any state could take action
under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made,
ValueClick and Be Free will prevail. 

Restrictions on Sales of Shares by Affiliates of Be Free  

        The shares of ValueClick common stock to be issued in connection with the merger will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of ValueClick common stock issued to any person who is deemed to be an "affiliate" of Be Free at the time of the Be Free annual meeting.
Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under the common control of Be Free and may include executive officers, directors and
major stockholders of Be Free. Affiliates may not sell their shares of ValueClick common stock acquired in connection with the merger except pursuant to: 


an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares;


an
exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or


any
other applicable exemption under the Securities Act. 

        ValueClick's
registration statement on Form S-4, of which this document forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of ValueClick common stock to be received by
Be Free's affiliates in connection with the merger. 

Appraisal Rights  

        Under Delaware law, no Be Free stockholder is entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. 

Delisting and Deregistration of Be Free Common Stock after the Merger  

        If the merger is completed, Be Free common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq National Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. 

THE MERGER AGREEMENT    

The following summary highlights selected information from the merger agreement, the complete text of which is incorporated by reference
and attached to this document as Annex A. This summary may not contain all the information that is important to you. ValueClick and Be Free urge you to read carefully the merger agreement in its
entirety.

Effective Time  

        Once all of the conditions to the merger contained in the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived and all conditions of Delaware law have been satisfied,
ValueClick and Be Free will complete the merger. Unless otherwise specified in the certificate of merger, the merger will become effective when a certificate of merger is filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State. 

Conversion and Exchange of Be Free Stock  

        At the effective time, each issued and outstanding share of Be Free common stock will be converted automatically into 0.65882 of one share of ValueClick common
stock. This multiple is referred to in this document as the exchange ratio. 

        No
fractional shares of ValueClick common stock will be issued in the merger. Instead, fractional shares will be paid in cash, without interest, based on the closing price for ValueClick
common stock reported by Nasdaq on the day on which the merger becomes effective. 

Exchange of Certificates  

        Soon after the effective time, Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C., the exchange agent, will mail to each record holder of Be Free common stock a transmittal letter
that will detail the procedures for record
holders to exchange Be Free common stock certificates for ValueClick common stock certificates and to exchange cash for any fractional share. Transmittal letters will also be available following
completion of the merger at the offices of the exchange agent at 85 Challenger Road, Ridgefield Park, NJ 07660. Additionally, after the effective time, holders of Be Free common stock certificates can
exchange their stock certificates for certificates evidencing ValueClick common stock at the offices of the exchange agent. Do not surrender your certificate before the effective time. After the
effective time, transfers of Be Free common stock will not be registered on Be Free stock transfer books. 

        No
dividends or other distributions on the ValueClick common stock that are declared or made after the merger and have a record date after the merger will be paid to Be Free stockholders
until they surrender their certificates. 

Be Free Stock Options and Restricted Stock  

        At the effective time, each outstanding Be Free stock option will be assumed by ValueClick and become an option to purchase a number of shares of ValueClick
common stock equal to the number of shares of Be Free common stock subject to that Be Free stock option immediately before the effective time, multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share. The exercise price of the ValueClick stock option will be equal to the exercise price of Be Free stock option divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent. All
other terms and conditions of the Be Free stock options will remain the same. 

        Most
Be Free option agreements provide that the optionee will be entitled to one year of vesting credit upon the effectiveness of the merger. If, prior to the two-year anniversary of the
merger, the company terminates the employment of the optionee involuntarily, significantly diminishes the optionee's duties and responsibilities or takes certain other actions, then the option will
vest in full. 

        Based
on the Be Free stock options outstanding at the record date and assuming no Be Free stock options are exercised prior to the effective time, ValueClick will be required to reserve
approximately                shares of ValueClick common stock for issuance upon exercise of Be Free stock options that ValueClick will assume in the merger. 

        Most
Be Free restricted stock agreements provide that the number of shares subject to Be Free's repurchase right shall be reduced by 25% upon the effectiveness of the merger. If, prior
to the two-year anniversary of the merger, the company terminates the employment of the restricted stock holder involuntarily, significantly diminishes the restricted stock holder's duties and
responsibilities or takes certain other actions, then all vesting will accelerate in full and the repurchase right will terminate.

 No Solicitation of Be Free Competing Transactions  

        The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting Be Free from seeking a competing transaction. Under these "no solicitation" provisions, Be Free has
agreed that neither it nor its affiliates will authorize or permit any of its representatives to, directly or indirectly: 


encourage,
solicit, participate in or initiate or resume (including by way of furnishing or disclosing non-public information), or take any
action designed to facilitate, any discussions, inquiries, negotiations or any other action that could reasonably be expected to lead to the making of any proposals with respect to or concerning any
"Be Free competing transaction;" or


withdraw
or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, Be Free's position with respect to the merger agreement or approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend any Be Free competing transaction, or enter into any agreement with respect to any Be Free competing transaction. 

        A
"Be Free competing transaction" is: 


any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction involving Be Free or any Be Free subsidiary after which the
stockholders of Be Free will control less than eighty-five percent of the voting power of the surviving entity;


any
sale, lease, exchange, license, transfer or other disposition of fifteen percent or more of the assets (other than sales of inventory and
non-exclusive licenses to customers in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices) of Be Free or any Be Free subsidiary, in a single transaction or a series of
transactions;


any
tender offer or exchange offer for fifteen percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of Be Free or any Be Free subsidiary or the filing of a
registration statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith;


any
person having acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group" (as such term is defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) having been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, fifteen percent or more of the outstanding voting securities
of Be Free or any Be Free subsidiary; 


any
solicitation in opposition to the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Be Free; or


any
public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing. 

        Be
Free's board of directors is not prohibited from taking and disclosing to Be Free's stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party not solicited,
encouraged, discussed, continued or failed to be ceased or terminated in contravention of the merger agreement pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, or making such
disclosure to Be Free's stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of Be Free, pursuant to advice from outside counsel, is required under applicable law. In addition, these
restrictions will not prohibit Be Free from furnishing information concerning its business, properties or assets to any corporation, person or other entity or group pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement at least as restrictive as the confidentiality agreement between ValueClick and Be Free, or entering into or conducting discussions or negotiations with a third party concerning a Be Free
competing transaction if: 


such
entity or group has, on an unsolicited basis, submitted a bona fide written proposal to the board of directors of Be Free relating to any such
transaction which the board determines in good faith, consistent with advice of an independent investment banker, (1) is capable of being and likely to be funded on the disclosed terms and
(2) is likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms; and


in
the opinion of the board of directors of Be Free, the failure to take such action would likely constitute a breach by the board of directors of Be Free's
fiduciary duties to Be Free's stockholders under applicable law, determined only after receipt of (1) written opinion from Be Free's investment banking firm that the Be Free competing
transaction is superior, from a financial point of view, to the merger, and (2) written advice from independent legal counsel to Be Free that the failure to provide such information or access
or to engage in such discussions or negotiations would be likely to cause the board of directors of Be Free to violate its fiduciary duties to Be Free's stockholders under applicable law. 

        Prior
to the adoption of the merger agreement by Be Free's stockholders, Be Free is not prohibited from withdrawing or modifying its approval or recommendation of the merger agreement or
the
merger, approving or recommending a Be Free superior proposal, or entering into an agreement with respect to a Be Free superior proposal, in each case: 


at
any time after the fifth business day following ValueClick's receipt of written notice from Be Free advising ValueClick that the board of directors of Be
Free has received a Be Free superior proposal which it intends to accept;


specifying
the terms and conditions of such Be Free superior proposal, identifying the person or entity making such Be Free superior proposal; but


only
if Be Free shall have caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith with ValueClick to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement as would enable Be Free to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms. 

        Be
Free is prohibited from entering into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any third party providing for the payment of fees or reimbursement of expenses if ValueClick
makes a proposal in response to such Be Free superior proposal. A "Be Free superior proposal" means an unsolicited proposal in connection with a Be Free competing transaction (but changing the fifteen
percent amounts of the definition of Be Free competing transaction to fifty percent) not resulting from, 

arising out of or otherwise by virtue of any breach of the provisions applicable to the non-solicitation of a Be Free competing transaction. 

        Be
Free has agreed that: 


it
will promptly notify ValueClick of the existence of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry of the type referred to in the provisions applicable
to the non-solicitation of a Be Free competing transaction received by Be Free, any Be Free subsidiary or any of their respective representatives, and Be Free will promptly communicate to
ValueClick the terms of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it, any Be Free subsidiary or any of their respective representatives may receive (and will promptly provide to
ValueClick copies of any written materials received by Be Free, any Be Free subsidiary or their respective representatives in connection with such proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry) and the
identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry or engaging in such discussion or negotiation;


it
will promptly provide to ValueClick any non-public information concerning Be Free provided to any other party which was not previously
provided to ValueClick; and


it
will immediately cease any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of March 10, 2002, the date of the merger agreement, with any
parties conducted before that date with respect to any Be Free competing transaction. 

 No Solicitation of ValueClick Competing Transactions  

        The merger agreement contains detailed provisions prohibiting ValueClick from seeking a competing transaction. Under these "no solicitation" provisions,
ValueClick has agreed that neither it nor its affiliates will authorize or permit any of its representatives to, directly or indirectly: 


encourage,
solicit, participate in or initiate or resume (including by way of furnishing or disclosing non-public information), or take any
action designed to facilitate, any discussions, inquiries, negotiations or any other action that could reasonably be expected to lead to the making of any proposals with respect to or concerning any
"ValueClick competing transaction;" or


withdraw
or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, ValueClick's position with respect to the merger agreement or approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend any ValueClick competing transaction, or enter into any agreement with respect to any ValueClick competing transaction. 

        A
"ValueClick competing transaction" is: 


any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction involving ValueClick or any ValueClick subsidiary after which
the stockholders of ValueClick will control less than fifty-five percent of the voting power of the surviving entity;


any
sale, lease, exchange, license, transfer or other disposition of forty-five percent or more of the assets (other than sales of inventory and
non-exclusive licenses to customers in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices) of ValueClick or any ValueClick subsidiary, in a single transaction or a series of
transactions;


any
tender offer or exchange offer for forty-five percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of ValueClick or any ValueClick subsidiary
or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith;


any
person having acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, or any "group" (as such term is defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) having been 

formed
which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, forty-five percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of ValueClick or any ValueClick
subsidiary; 


any
solicitation in opposition to the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of ValueClick; or


any
public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing. 

        ValueClick's
board of directors is not prohibited, however, from taking and disclosing to ValueClick's stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party
not solicited, encouraged, discussed, continued or failed to be ceased or terminated in contravention of the merger agreement pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, or
making such disclosure to ValueClick's stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of ValueClick, pursuant to advice from outside counsel, is required under applicable law.
In addition, these restrictions will not prohibit ValueClick from furnishing information concerning its business, properties or assets to any corporation, person or other entity or group pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as the confidentiality agreement between ValueClick and Be Free, or entering into or conducting discussions or negotiations with a third party
concerning a ValueClick competing transaction if: 


such
entity or group has, on an unsolicited basis, submitted a bona fide written proposal to the board of directors of ValueClick relating to any such
transaction which the board determines in good faith, consistent with advice of an independent investment banker, (1) is capable of being and likely to be funded on the disclosed terms and
(2) is likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms; and


in
the opinion of the board of directors of ValueClick, the failure to take such action would likely constitute a breach by the board of directors of
ValueClick's fiduciary duties to ValueClick's stockholders under applicable law, determined only after receipt of (1) written opinion from ValueClick's investment banking firm that the
ValueClick competing transaction is superior, from a financial point of view, to the merger, and (2) written advice from independent legal counsel to ValueClick that the failure to provide such
information or access or to engage in such discussions or negotiations would be likely to cause the board of directors of ValueClick to violate its fiduciary duties to ValueClick's stockholders under
applicable law. 

        Prior
to the approval of the merger agreement by ValueClick's stockholders, ValueClick is not prohibited from withdrawing or modifying its approval or recommendation of the merger
agreement or
the merger, approving or recommending a ValueClick superior proposal, or entering into an agreement with respect to a ValueClick superior proposal, in each case: 


at
any time after the fifth business day following Be Free's receipt of written notice from ValueClick advising Be Free that the board of directors of
ValueClick has received a ValueClick superior proposal which it intends to accept;


specifying
the terms and conditions of such ValueClick superior proposal, identifying the person or entity making such ValueClick superior proposal; but


only
if ValueClick shall have caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith with Be Free to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement as would enable ValueClick to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms. 

        ValueClick
is prohibited from entering into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any third party providing for the payment of fees or reimbursement of expenses if Be Free
makes a proposal in response to such ValueClick superior proposal. A ValueClick superior proposal means an 

unsolicited proposal in connection with a ValueClick competing transaction not resulting from, arising out of or otherwise by virtue of any breach of the provisions applicable to the
non-solicitation of a ValueClick competing transaction. 

        ValueClick
has agreed that: 


it
will promptly notify Be Free of the existence of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry of the type referred to in the provisions applicable to
the non-solicitation of a ValueClick competing transaction received by ValueClick, any ValueClick subsidiary or any of their respective representatives, and ValueClick will promptly
communicate to Be Free the terms of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it, any ValueClick subsidiary or any of their respective representatives may receive (and will promptly
provide to Be Free copies of any written materials received by ValueClick, any ValueClick subsidiary or their respective representatives in connection with such proposal, discussion, negotiation or
inquiry) and the identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry or engaging in such discussion or negotiation;


it
will promptly provide to Be Free any non-public information concerning ValueClick provided to any other party which was not previously
provided to Be Free; and


it
will immediately cease any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of March 10, 2002, the date of the merger agreement, with any
parties conducted before that date with respect to any ValueClick competing transaction. 

 Access; Confidentiality  

        ValueClick and Be Free have also agreed to provide to the officers, employees and other representatives of the other party, prior to the date and time at which
the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware: 


full
access, which includes the right to conduct such environmental studies as each party, in its reasonable discretion, deems appropriate, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records;


copies
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by each party pursuant to the federal securities laws; and


all
other information concerning each party's business as the other party may reasonably request. 

 Reasonable Efforts  

        Prior to the closing of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, ValueClick, its merger subsidiary and Be Free agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any applicable laws) to consummate
the merger and make effective the merger and the other transactions as promptly as practicable including: 


the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the merger and the other transactions and the taking of
such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, orders, exemptions or waivers by any third party or governmental entity;


the
satisfaction of the other party's conditions to closing;


the
taking of no action after the date of the merger agreement that would materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission,
approval or consent from any governmental entity necessary to be obtained prior to closing; 


promptly
consulting with the other parties involved in the merger with respect to, providing any necessary information with respect to, and providing the
other parties (or their respective counsel) with copies of, all filings made by such party with any governmental entity or any other information supplied by such party to a governmental entity in
connection with the merger and the other transactions;


promptly
informing the other parties involved in the merger of any communication from any governmental entity regarding any of the transactions;


endeavoring
in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other parties, an appropriate
response in compliance with the receipt by any party to the merger agreement or its affiliate of a request for additional information or documentary material from any such governmental entity with
respect to any of the transactions;


effecting
transfers, amendments or modifications of permits (including environmental permits) by Be Free and its subsidiaries required as a result of the
execution of the merger agreement or consummation of any of the transactions;


the
filing, as soon as practicable, of notifications under applicable antitrust laws and responding as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from
the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation;


responding
as promptly as practicable to all inquiries and requests received from any state attorney general or other governmental entity in connection with
antitrust matters; and


requesting
early termination of any waiting period under applicable antitrust laws. 

        Nothing
in the merger agreement shall be deemed to require ValueClick or any of its subsidiaries to: 


divest
or hold separate any assets or otherwise restrict its conduct of business; or


commence
any litigation against any entity in order to facilitate the consummation of the merger and related transactions or to defend against any litigation
brought by any governmental entity seeking to prevent the consummation of the merger and related transactions. 

        In
connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals under applicable antitrust laws, neither Be Free nor any of Be Free's subsidiaries shall be entitled to divest or hold separate
or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits ValueClick's or Be Free's as ValueClick's subsidiary, freedom of action with respect of, or their ability to retain, Be Free or any Be Free
subsidiary or any material portions thereof or any of the businesses, product lines, properties or assets of Be Free or any of its subsidiaries, without ValueClick's prior written consent (which may
be withheld in ValueClick's sole and absolute discretion). 

 Board Composition  

        In connection with the merger agreement, ValueClick has agreed to reduce the size of the board of directors from nine to seven members and to
appoint                        ,
                        and                 
       to the board of directors of ValueClick upon the completion of the merger.

business, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or results of operations of the applicable company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; or

of ValueClick's and Be Free's stock price, changes resulting from the announcement of the execution or compliance with the terms of the merger agreement, or continued incurrence of losses by either
ValueClick or Be Free in the ordinary course of business. 

        Each
of the conditions to ValueClick's and Be Free's obligation to complete the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be waived, in whole or in part, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, by agreement of ValueClick and Be Free. 

Termination  

        The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the merger, whether before or after the stockholder approvals have been obtained: 


by
mutual written consent of ValueClick and Be Free; 


by
either ValueClick or Be Free if:


the
merger is not completed on or before September 1, 2002, except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the merger to be completed on such date;


any
governmental entity issues an order, decree or ruling or takes any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger,
and the order, decree, ruling or other action becomes final and nonappealable; or


the
necessary vote of either party's stockholders to adopt or approve, as appropriate, the merger agreement is not obtained. 


by
ValueClick if:


Be
Free's board of directors fails to recommend that Be Free's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and approval of the merger
or effects a change in such recommendation, whether or not permitted by the terms of the merger agreement;


ValueClick
notifies Be Free that it intends to accept a superior proposal, complies with the requirements of the "no solicitation" provisions of the merger
agreement, including negotiating in good faith with Be Free to make changes to the merger agreement that would enable ValueClick to proceed with the merger, and pays Be Free a termination fee; or


Be
Free breaches in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement which breach
cannot be or has not been cured within thirty days after giving written notice of such breach by ValueClick to Be Free. 


by
Be Free if:


ValueClick's
board of directors fails to recommend that ValueClick's stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the issuance of shares of ValueClick
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or effects a change in such recommendation, whether or not permitted by the terms of the merger agreement;


Be
Free notifies ValueClick that it intends to accept a superior proposal, complies with the requirements of the "no solicitation" provisions of the merger
agreement, including negotiating in good faith with ValueClick to make changes to the merger agreement that would enable Be Free to proceed with the merger, and pays ValueClick a termination fee; or


ValueClick
breaches in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement which
breach cannot be or has not been cured written notice of such breach by Be Free to ValueClick. 

        Effect of Termination.
    If the merger is terminated, there shall be no liability on the part of any party to the merger
agreement except for (a) fraud or intentional misstatement, (b) willful material breach of the merger agreement prior to such termination or abandonment of the merger or (c) if
applicable, the termination fee and expenses in accordance with the merger agreement. Only sections relating to no solicitation, termination, fees and expenses, amendment and modification, and other
miscellaneous provisions will survive the termination of the merger agreement. 

        Termination Fee and/or Payment of Expenses Upon Termination.
    The merger agreement requires each party to make a payment to
the other party depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. Specifically, if the agreement is terminated because: 


Be
Free's board of directors failed to recommend that Be Free's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement or effected a change in
its recommendation of the adoption of the merger agreement, or Be Free accepts a superior proposal, then Be Free must pay to ValueClick a
termination fee of $5,133,126 plus expenses up to $1,283,282 incurred by ValueClick and its subsidiaries with respect to the merger.


Be
Free failed to obtain the required vote at a stockholders meeting to approve the merger, then within one business day of termination, Be Free will pay to
ValueClick expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement by ValueClick and its subsidiaries up to $1,283,282. However, if prior to the termination there shall have been publicly announced
a Be Free competing transaction and within nine months of the termination Be Free enters into a definitive agreement implementing any Be Free competing transaction, then Be Free will also pay
ValueClick the termination fee of $5,133,126.


ValueClick's
board of directors failed to recommend that ValueClick's stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement or effected a change
in its recommendation of the adoption of the merger agreement, or ValueClick accepts a superior proposal, then ValueClick must pay to Be Free a termination fee of $5,133,126 plus expenses up to
$1,283,282 incurred by Be Free and its subsidiaries with respect to the merger.


ValueClick
failed to obtain the required vote at a stockholders meeting to approve the merger, then within one business day of termination, ValueClick will
pay to Be Free expenses incurred in connection with the merger by Be Free and its subsidiaries up to $1,283,282. However, if prior to the termination there shall have been publicly announced a
ValueClick competing transaction and within nine months of the termination ValueClick enters into a definitive agreement implementing any ValueClick competing transaction, then ValueClick will also
pay Be Free the termination fee of $5,133,126. 

Expenses  

        With the exception of the provisions above regarding termination fees and expenses, whether or not the merger is completed, all expenses and fees incurred in
connection with the merger agreement and the merger will be paid by the party incurring the expenses or fees except that ValueClick and Be Free shall each pay one half of the filing fee relating to
the U.S. antitrust laws and the costs related to printing and/or mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement. 

Amendment, Extension and Waiver  

        The merger agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of Be Free, by
written agreement of the parties, by action taken by their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the closing date with respect to any of the terms contained in the merger agreement; 

provided
, 
however
, that after the approval of the merger agreement by the stockholders of Be Free, no
such amendment, modification or supplement shall reduce the amount or change the form of the consideration payable under the merger agreement. 

RELATED AGREEMENTS    

Voting Agreements  

        The following summary of the voting agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the voting agreements, forms of which are
exhibits to the registration statement that ValueClick filed with the SEC. We urge you to carefully read the full text of the voting agreements. 

        In

Partnership VIII-A, LLC, Samuel P. Gerace, Jr., Gordon B. Hoffstein, Ted R. Dintersmith, Dintersmith Family Limited Partnership, Jeffrey F. Rayport, W. Blair Heavey, Stephen M. Joseph and
Thomas A. Gerace under which those Be Free stockholders agreed to vote an aggregate of 11,245,652 shares of Be Free common stock with respect to which they have voting power in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement. As of the record date for the Be Free annual meeting, these shares of Be Free common stock represented approximately            % of the total voting power of the

        In
addition, Be Free entered into voting agreements with James R. Zarley, Steven J. Umberger, David S. Buzby, Robert D. Leppo, Martin T. Hart, Brian Coryat and Gregory R. Raifman under
which those ValueClick stockholders agreed to vote an aggregate of 8,467,548 shares of ValueClick common stock in favor of the approval of the merger agreement. As of the record date for the
ValueClick annual meeting, these shares of ValueClick common stock represented approximately            % of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of ValueClick capital stock.

        These
voting agreements terminate on the earliest of the closing date of the merger, the termination of the merger agreement or September 1, 2002. 

VALUECLICK DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK    

        This section describes the material terms of ValueClick's capital stock, its amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its restated bylaws which will
continue to be in effect immediately after the merger is completed. The information below reflects the 100,000,000 share increase in the authorized number of shares of ValueClick common stock for
which stockholder approval is sought under Proposal Number Two at the ValueClick annual meeting. This section also summarizes relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which is
referred to herein as "Delaware law." ValueClick urges you to carefully read its amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws which are exhibits to the registration statement it filed
with the SEC. See "Where You Can Find More Information." 

Authorized Capital Stock  

        Total Shares.
    ValueClick is authorized to issue a total of 220,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of: 


200,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share; and


20,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. 

        Common Stock.
    Following completion of the merger, ValueClick anticipates that approximately 95.2 million shares of its
common stock will be outstanding. 

        Preferred Stock.
    There are no outstanding shares of ValueClick preferred stock. 

ValueClick Common Stock  

        Holders of ValueClick common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of the ValueClick stockholders. Holders of
ValueClick common stock are entitled to receive dividends, ratably, if any, as may be declared by the ValueClick board of directors out of legally available funds, subject to any preferential dividend
rights of any outstanding preferred stock. If ValueClick liquidates, dissolves or winds up, the holders of ValueClick common stock are entitled to
share ratably in all assets remaining after satisfaction of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive
rights and no right to convert their common stock onto any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to ValueClick common stock. The rights, preferences and
privileges of holders of ValueClick common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of shares of any series of preferred stock which we may designate and issue in
the future without further stockholder approval. 

ValueClick Preferred Stock  

        The ValueClick board of directors will be authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of
preferred stock in one or more series and to fix or alter the designations, preferences, rights and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each series, including the dividend
rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, term of redemption, including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares
constituting any series or designations of any series. ValueClick may issue ValueClick preferred stock in ways which may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of ValueClick without further
action by ValueClick stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of ValueClick common stock. The issuance of ValueClick preferred stock with voting and conversion
rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of ValueClick common stock, including the loss of voting control to others. 

Registration Rights  

        In connection with DoubleClick's February 2000 investment in ValueClick, ValueClick granted DoubleClick demand and "piggyback" registration rights with
respect to 7,878,562 shares of ValueClick common stock. After February 28, 2004, DoubleClick may exercise its right to demand registration of its shares no more than four times and no more than
twice in any twelve-month period. In addition, DoubleClick may require ValueClick to include its shares in certain future registration statements that ValueClick files and may require ValueClick to
register its shares on Form S-3. Upon registration, these shares will be freely tradable without restriction. ValueClick agreed to pay for the expenses of DoubleClick's four demand
registrations, all piggyback registrations requested by DoubleClick and up to three registrations on Form S-3 requested by DoubleClick. 

        In
connection with ValueClick's acquisition of Bach Systems, Inc. in November 2000, ValueClick entered into a registration rights agreement with the former stockholders of
Bach Systems. Under the terms of the registration rights agreement, ValueClick agreed to file, at such time when it becomes eligible to use SEC Form S-3, a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 covering the 750,000 shares of ValueClick stock issued to the former shareholders of Bach Systems and any shares of ValueClick stock issued to these
shareholders pursuant to the earn-out features of the merger agreement. ValueClick has agreed to keep effective such shelf registration statement for a period of three years from the date
it first becomes effective. 

Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law and ValueClick's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws  

        Provisions of Delaware law and ValueClick's charter documents could make the acquisition of ValueClick and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more
difficult. These provisions are expected to discourage some coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of ValueClick to negotiate with
ValueClick first. ValueClick believes that the benefits of increased protection of its potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or
restructure ValueClick outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging such proposals because, among other things, negotiation could result in an improvement of the terms of such proposal. 

        ValueClick
is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, this statute prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation
from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date that the person became an interested stockholder unless (with certain exceptions)
the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a "business combination" includes a merger, asset or
stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder. Generally, an "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within
three years prior, did own) 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of ValueClick without further
action by its stockholders. 

        ValueClick's
bylaws set forth an advance notice procedure with regard to the nomination, other than by or at the direction of its board of directors, of candidates for election as
directors and with regard to business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders. 

Transfer Agent and Registrar  

        The transfer agent and registrar for ValueClick's common stock is Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C. 

Listing  

        ValueClick common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "VCLK." 

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF VALUECLICK STOCKHOLDERS AND
  BE FREE STOCKHOLDERS    

        ValueClick and Be Free are both organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Any differences in the rights of holders of ValueClick capital stock and Be
Free capital stock arise primarily from differences between the companies' certificates of incorporation and bylaws. Upon completion of the merger, holders of Be Free common stock will become holders
of ValueClick common stock and their rights will be governed by Delaware law, the ValueClick certificate of incorporation, as amended, and the ValueClick bylaws. 

        This
section does not include a complete description of all differences between the rights of ValueClick and Be Free stockholders, nor does it include a complete description of the

VALUECLICK PROPOSAL NUMBER TWO: TO AMEND AND RESTATE THE VALUECLICK, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION    

        The ValueClick stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal to amend and restate ValueClick's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase
the authorized number of shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000. The Board authorized the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation on March 10, 2002. The full
text of the proposed Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is attached as Annex D to this Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 

        The
amended and restated certificate of incorporation currently provides that ValueClick is authorized to issue two classes of stock, consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of March 10, 2002, 51,867,374 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, 1,667,581 shares of common stock were issued and held in treasury, no
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding and 6,240,080 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options. The remaining shares of authorized but
unissued common stock are not reserved for any specific use and are available for future issuance. 

Purpose and Effect of Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation  

        The ValueClick board of directors believes it is desirable to increase the total number of shares of common stock that ValueClick is authorized to issue from
100,000,000 to 200,000,000 in order to have a sufficient number of authorized shares for issuance in connection with the merger. The approval of the Second Amended and Restate Certificate of
Incorporation is necessary to consummate the merger. In addition, the proposed Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will authorize sufficient additional shares of common stock to
provide ValueClick the flexibility to make such issuances as may be necessary for ValueClick to complete acquisitions or other corporate transactions and to issue shares in connection with
ValueClick's stock option, stock purchase and other existing
employee benefit plans. The proposed Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation should facilitate ValueClick's ability to accomplish these goals and other business and financial
objectives in the future without delaying such activities for further stockholder approval, except as may be required in particular cases by ValueClick's charter documents, applicable law or the rules
of any stock exchange or other system on which ValueClick's securities may then be listed. Future issuances of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock, whether
pursuant to an acquisition or other corporate transaction, would have the effect of diluting the voting rights and could have the effect of diluting earnings per share and book value per share of
existing stockholders. The availability for issuance of additional shares of common stock could discourage or make more difficult efforts to obtain control of ValueClick. 

Vote Required  

        The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of ValueClick common stock outstanding as of the record date is required for approval of the proposal
to amend and restate ValueClick's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors  

The ValueClick board of directors recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the approval of the proposal to amend and restate
ValueClick's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

ADDITIONAL MATTERS BEING SUBMITTED TO A VOTE OF
  VALUECLICK STOCKHOLDERS ONLY    

VALUECLICK PROPOSAL NUMBER THREE: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS    

        ValueClick's bylaws provide that the exact number of directors will be fixed from time to time by action of its stockholders or board of directors. ValueClick's
board of directors has fixed the number of directors for the 2002 fiscal year at nine directors. Nine members of ValueClick's board of directors will be elected at the annual meeting. ValueClick's
board of directors has nominated each of the persons listed below to be elected as directors to serve for a one-year term and until their successors are duly
elected and qualified. However, as discussed below, five of the directors elected at the annual meeting will resign upon consummation of the merger. 

        Holders
of proxies solicited by this joint proxy statement/prospectus will vote the proxies received by them as directed on the proxy card or, if no direction is made, for the election
of the board of directors' nine director nominees below. Proxies cannot be voted for more than the nine named director nominees. 

        Each
nominee for election has agreed to serve if elected, and ValueClick has no reason to believe that each director nominee will be unavailable to serve. If any director nominee is
unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote for a director nominee designated by the present board of directors to fill the vacancy. Unless
otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them 
FOR
 the director nominees named below. 

        If
the merger is completed, and pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, ValueClick's board of directors will consist of seven members, to consist of four directors, including
Mr. Zarley, designated by ValueClick and three directors designated by Be Free. The three Be Free designees are                 ,
                        ,
and                        . As a result, upon
completion of the merger, the ValueClick board of directors will reduce the size of the board from nine to seven members and Messrs.             ,
                        ,            ,
                        and                 
       will resign from ValueClick's board of directors. Although it is currently anticipated that the merger will be completed shortly after ValueClick's stockholders
approve the issuance of the ValueClick shares and Be Free's stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger at the annual meetings, the parties cannot guarantee that the merger will be
completed as anticipated. If the merger is not completed, the nine directors elected at the ValueClick annual meeting will hold office until the 2003 annual meeting of stockholders and until their
successors are duly elected and qualified. For additional information regarding Messrs.                  ,
                        ,
and                        , please see Be Free's Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 22, 2002 and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Board of Directors  

        ValueClick's board of directors oversees ValueClick's business and affairs and monitors the performance of its management. In accordance with corporate governance
principles, the ValueClick board does not involve itself in day-to-day operations. The directors keep themselves informed through, among other things, discussions with the
chairman, other key executives and the company's principle external advisers (legal counsel, outside auditors, investment bankers and other consultants), reading reports and other materials that we
send them and participating in board and committee meetings. 

        ValueClick's
bylaws provide that the exact number of directors will be fixed from time to time by action of stockholders or board of directors. For the 2001 fiscal year, nine members
composed ValueClick's board of directors. The ValueClick board has fixed the number of directors for the 2002 fiscal year at nine directors. Each director serves until the next annual meeting or until
his successor is duly elected and qualified. 

        ValueClick
does not have a standing nominating committee. The full board of directors nominates the company's officers and directors for election. ValueClick's board of directors held
six meetings and did not act by unanimous written consent during fiscal 2001. Other than Mr. Carlin, all then current directors attended or participated in 75% or more of the aggregate of
(i) the total number of meetings of ValueClick's board of directors and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of ValueClick's board of directors on which such director
served during fiscal 2001. Mr. Carlin attended or participated in 50% of the total number of meetings of ValueClick's board of directors held in fiscal 2001 since his appointment to the board of
directors in October 2001. 

Board Committees and Meetings  

 Audit Committee  

        The audit committee monitors ValueClick's corporate financial reporting and internal and external audits. The audit committee also has the responsibility to: 


review
the audit committee charter at least annually and recommend any changes to our board of directors;


review
ValueClick's annual financial statements and any other relevant reports or other financial information;


review
the regular internal financial reports prepared by management and any internal auditing department;


recommend
to the board of directors the selection of the independent accountants and approve the fees and other compensation to be paid to the independent
accountants;


review
and discuss with the accountants all significant relationships that the independent accountants have with ValueClick to determine the accountants'
independence; 


review
the performance of the independent accountants and approve any proposed discharge of the independent accountants when circumstances warrant; and


following
completion of the annual audit, review separately with the independent accountants, the internal auditing department, if any, and management any
significant difficulties encountered during the course of the audit. 

        Messrs. Buzby,
Epstein and Hart serve as members of the audit committee. The audit committee met in February 2002 in connection with the audit of ValueClick's 2001
financial statements and held a total of four meetings during fiscal 2001. 

        The
ValueClick board of directors has adopted and approved a written charter for the Audit Committee. The listing standards of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
("NASD") require, among other things, that ValueClick have an audit committee of at least three members, comprised solely of independent directors, at least one of whom has past employment experience
in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background. The NASD's listing standards permit ValueClick's board of directors to
appoint one director to the audit committee who is not independent, if the board, under exceptional and limited circumstances, determines that such director's membership on the audit committee is in
the best interest of ValueClick and its stockholders, and the board discloses, in the next annual proxy statement subsequent to such determination, the nature of the relationship and the reasons for
that determination. Messrs. Buzby, Epstein and Hart are considered independent directors under the definition of independence in the NASD's listing standards. 

 Compensation Committee  

        The compensation committee is responsible for the design, review, recommendation and approval of compensation arrangements for ValueClick's directors, executive
officers and key employees, and for the administration of ValueClick's 1999 Stock Option Plan. Messrs. Leppo, Raifman, Umberger and Vadnais currently serve as members of the compensation
committee. The compensation committee met two times during fiscal 2001. 

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  

        No interlocking relationship exists between ValueClick's executive officers, board of directors or compensation committee and any executive officer or member of
the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company, nor has any such interlocking relationship existed in the past. See "ValueClick Certain Relationships and Related Transactions." 

Director Compensation  

        ValueClick's directors do not currently receive salaries or fees for serving as directors or for serving on committees of ValueClick's board of directors. Each
non-employee member of ValueClick's board is reimbursed for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
attendance at meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors. Directors are also eligible to receive options and shares of ValueClick common stock under its 1999 Stock
Option Plan. ValueClick has also entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Raifman, a member of ValueClick's board of directors. For additional information regarding this consulting
agreement, see "ValueClick Certain Relationships and Related Transactions." 

Vote Required  

        The nine director nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them shall be elected as directors. 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors  

ValueClick's board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the election of the director nominees named
above.

Relationships Among Executive Officers and Directors  

        There are no family relationships among any of the directors or executive officers of ValueClick. 

VALUECLICK SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE    

        Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires ValueClick's executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10%
of a registered class of ValueClick equity securities, to file an initial report of securities ownership on Form 3 and reports of changes in securities ownership on Form 4 or 5 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Such executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish ValueClick with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they
file. Based solely on ValueClick's review of the copies of such forms 

received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 4 or 5 were required for such persons, ValueClick believes that, for the reporting period from
January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001, its executive officers and directors complied with all their reporting requirements under Section 16(a) for such fiscal year, except that
Mr. Paisley did not timely file his Form 3 for January 2001 to report his initial statement of beneficial ownership, Brian Coryat and the Coryat Family Living Trust did not timely
file their Form 4s for March 2001 to report a sale of common stock, Messrs. Carlin, Raifman and Vadnais did not timely file their respective Form 3s for October 2001
to report their initial statement of beneficial ownership and Messrs. Johnson, Umberger and Wolfert did not timely file their respective Form 5s for the 2001 year to report their receipt of
stock options. 

VALUECLICK EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND RELATED INFORMATION

basis upon a liquidation or dissolution or certain changes in control transactions if the surviving corporation does not assume, substitute or replace the options.

(2)
During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, ValueClick granted options to purchase 4,471,278 shares of its common stock.

(3)
Options
were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of ValueClick's common stock at the date of the grant as measured by the closing price of its common stock as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market. Each option has a maximum term of ten years, subject to earlier termination upon the optionee's cessation of service with ValueClick.

(4)
Potential
realizable values are net of exercise price, but before the payment of taxes associated with exercise. Amounts represent hypothetical gains that could be achieved for the
respective options if exercised at the end of the option term. The 5% and 10% assumed annual rates of compounded stock price appreciation are mandated by rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and do not represent ValueClick's estimate or projection of its future common stock prices. These amounts represent assumed rates of appreciation in the value of the common stock from the
fair market value on the date of grant. Actual gains, if any, on stock option exercises are dependent on the future performance of the common stock and overall stock market conditions. The amounts
reflected in the table may not necessarily be achieved. 

Aggregate Option Exercises and Year-End Values at December 31, 2001  

        The following table sets forth information with respect to each ValueClick Named Executive Officer concerning their exercise of stock options during the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2001 and the number of shares subject to unexercised stock options held by them as of the close of such fiscal year. No stock appreciation rights were exercised during
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, and no stock appreciation rights were outstanding at the close of such year. 

        In
the following table, "Value Realized" is equal to the difference between the fair value of the shares at the time of exercise and the exercise price paid for the shares and the "Value
of Unexercised In-The-Money Options" is based on the closing selling price per share of ValueClick common stock at 

the close of the 2001 fiscal year less the exercise price payable per share. Options are "In-the-Money" if the fair market value of the underlying options exceeds the exercise
price of the option.

VALUECLICK CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS    

        On February 28, 2000, ValueClick completed a strategic investment transaction with DoubleClick, Inc., a leading worldwide provider of Internet
advertising solutions for advertisers and Web publishers. The terms of this agreement involved an investment by DoubleClick of approximately $95.8 million in ValueClick and possible additional
investments by DoubleClick in the future. 

DoubleClick's common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "DCLK." Under the terms of the investment, DoubleClick acquired approximately 30% of ValueClick's fully diluted
outstanding common stock and a fifteen-month warrant to acquire additional shares of ValueClick common stock at $21.76 per share for an amount of shares so that DoubleClick could own up to
45% of ValueClick's fully diluted capital stock. This warrant expired unexercised in May 2001. 

        ValueClick,
along with several of its principal stockholders, also agreed to grant additional rights to DoubleClick, including an agreement to elect designees of DoubleClick to
ValueClick's board of directors, a right of first offer in connection with future sales of shares of ValueClick's capital stock and a right of first offer in the event of a sale of ValueClick. In
addition, in connection with the strategic transaction with DoubleClick, ValueClick entered into a DART services agreement with DoubleClick relating to DoubleClick's dynamic ad matching, targeting and
delivery technology. This DART agreement was terminated by ValueClick in accordance with its terms. 

        In
connection with ValueClick's acquisition of Mediaplex, Inc., a provider of technology-based marketing products and services, in October 2001, ValueClick entered into a
consulting agreement with Gregory Raifman, a member of ValueClick's board of directors and former Chairman of the Board of Mediaplex. Under the terms of the consulting agreement, Mr. Raifman is
entitled to an annual consulting fee of $250,000 and will provide ValueClick with consulting services with respect to corporate development, strategic alliances and other strategic transactions, and
such other duties as ValueClick may from time to time prescribe. 

VALUECLICK PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS    

        The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of the shares of ValueClick's common stock as of March 1, 2002, except as
noted in the footnotes below, by: 


Each
person who ValueClick knows to be the beneficial owner of 5% or more of its outstanding common stock;


Each
ValueClick Named Executive Officer;


Each
of ValueClick's directors; and


All
of ValueClick's Named Executive Officers and directors as a group. 

        Beneficial
ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the
percentage of ownership of that person, shares of ValueClick common stock subject to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or that will become exercisable within sixty days
after March 1, 2002, are deemed outstanding even if they have not actually been exercised. Those shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage
ownership of any other person. As of March 1, 2002, 53,535,000 shares of ValueClick's common stock were issued and outstanding. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes below, and subject to
community property laws where applicable, each of the named persons have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown as beneficially owned. Unless otherwise indicated, the
address of the beneficial owner below is c/o ValueClick, Inc., 4360 Park Terrace Drive, Suite 100, Westlake Village, California 91361.

VALUECLICK REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION    

        The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall
such information be incorporated by
reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that ValueClick specifically incorporates it by
reference in such filing. 

        The
following is a report of the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of ValueClick board of directors and of the ValueClick board of directors describing the
compensation policies applicable to ValueClick's executive officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001. The Compensation Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the
ValueClick board regarding all forms of compensation to be provided to ValueClick's executive officers, senior executives and directors. The ValueClick board then takes action on these
recommendations. 

        For
the 2001 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee was comprised as follows: (i) for the period January 1 to October 26, the members were David Buzby, Brian Coryat
and Barry Salzman and (ii) for the balance of the 2001 fiscal year, the members were Robert D. Leppo, Gregory R. Raifman and Steve Umberger. All members of the compensation committee during the
2001 fiscal year were outside board members for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code other than Messrs. Coryat, Raifman and Umberger. 

General Compensation Policy  

        ValueClick's compensation policy is designed to attract and retain qualified key executives critical to ValueClick's growth and long-term success. The
objective of the policy is to have a portion of each executive's compensation contingent upon ValueClick's performance, as well as upon the individual's personal performance. Accordingly, each
executive officer's compensation package is comprised of three elements: (1) base salary which reflects individual performance and expertise; (2) variable bonus awards which are payable
in cash and tied to the achievement of certain performance goals; and (3) long-term stock-based incentive awards which are designed to strengthen the mutuality of interests between
the executive officers and ValueClick's stockholders. 

        The
following summary describes in more detail the factors the Compensation Committee considers in establishing each of the three primary components of the compensation package provided
to the executive officers. 

Base Salary  

        The level of base salary is established on the basis of the individual's qualifications and relevant experience, the strategic goals for which she or he has
responsibility, compensation levels at companies which compete with ValueClick for business and executive talent, and incentives necessary to attract and retain qualified management. Base salary is
adjusted annually to take into account the individual's performance and to maintain a competitive salary structure. It is the policy of ValueClick that the
Compensation Committee or the board of directors review and approve base wage compensation proposals for executive officers. 

Cash-Based Incentive Compensation  

        Cash bonuses are awarded to executive officers on the basis of their success in achieving designated individual goals and ValueClick's success in achieving
specific company-wide goals, such as revenue growth, operating margin targets and new business opportunities. 

Long-Term Incentive Compensation  

        ValueClick utilizes its 1999 Stock Option Plan to provide executives and other key employees with incentives to maximize long-term stockholder values.
Awards under this plan take the form of stock options designed to give the recipient a meaningful stake in the equity in ValueClick and thereby closely align his or her interests with those of
ValueClick's stockholders. 

        Each
grant allows the executive officer to acquire shares of ValueClick's common stock at a fixed price per share over a specified period of time (up to ten years). Each option generally
becomes exercisable in a series of installments over time, contingent upon the executive officer's continued employment with ValueClick. Accordingly, the option will provide a return to the executive
officer only if he remains employed by ValueClick during the vesting period, and then only if the fair market value of the underlying shares appreciates over the option term. 

        The
size of the option grant made to each executive officer is set by the Compensation Committee at a level that is intended to create a meaningful opportunity for stock ownership based
upon the individual's current position with ValueClick, the individual's personal performance in recent periods, and his or her potential for future responsibility and promotion over the option term.
The Compensation Committee also takes into account the number of unvested options held by the executive officer in order to maintain an appropriate level of equity incentive for that individual. The
relevant weight given to each of these factors varies from individual to individual. 

Compensation of the Chief Executive Officer  

        James R. Zarley has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors since May 1998, and as Chief Executive Officer of ValueClick since May 1999. He
became President of ValueClick in January 2001. The factors discussed above under "Base Salary" and "Long-Term Incentive Compensation" were applied in establishing the amount of
Mr. Zarley's salary. Mr. Zarley's base salary for 2001 was determined after considering a number of ValueClick's business achievements in 2000, including substantial growth in
ValueClick's business and growth and development in ValueClick's organization, as well as Mr. Zarley's assumption of increased duties during 2000. 

Deductibility of Executive Compensation  

        Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to certain of their executive
officers to the extent that such compensation exceeds $1.0 million per covered officer in any fiscal year. The limitation applies only to compensation that is not considered to be
performance-based. Non-performance-based compensation paid to ValueClick's executive officers for the 2001 fiscal year did not exceed the $1.0 million limit per officer, and the
Compensation Committee does not expect the non-performance-based compensation to be paid to ValueClick's executive officers for the 2002 fiscal year to exceed that limit. Because it is
unlikely that the cash compensation payable to any of ValueClick's executive officers in the foreseeable future will approach the $1.0 million limit, ValueClick does not expect to take any
action to limit or restructure the elements of cash compensation payable to ValueClick's executive officers so as to qualify that compensation as performance-based compensation under
Section 162(m). ValueClick will reconsider this decision should the individual cash compensation of any executive officer ever approach the $1.0 million level. A substantial number of
option grants made to date under ValueClick's 1999 Stock Option Plan have not met the requirements necessary to qualify as performance-based compensation because (i) the plan did not impose the
requisite limitation on the maximum number of shares for which option grants may be made to any one individual and (ii) the plan has not all times been administered by a committee comprised
solely of two or more outside board members as required under Section 162(m). However, ValueClick will be asking its stockholders to approve an amendment to the 1999 Stock Option Plan which
will impose the requisite limitation on the maximum number of 

shares for which options may be granted per individual, and the Compensation Committee will reconstitute itself following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders so it will, with respect to option grants
made under the 1999 Stock Option Plan to executive officers of ValueClick, be comprised solely of outside directors as required by Section 162(m). As a result of this amendment, any
compensation deemed paid in connection with the exercise of future option grants made to executive officers under the 1999 Stock Option Plan with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
the option shares on the grant date should qualify as performance-based compensation that will not be subject to the $1.0 million limitation.

consolidated statements of operations, Stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, and the notes thereto. The information
contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any
future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that ValueClick specifically incorporates it by reference in such
filing. 

Review with Management  

        The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed ValueClick's audited financial statements with management. 

Review and Discussions with Independent Accountants  

        The Audit Committee has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, ValueClick's independent accountants, the matters required to be discussed by SAS61
(Codification of Statements on Accounting Standards) which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of ValueClick's financial statements. 

        The
Audit Committee has also received written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (which relates to
the accountants' independence from ValueClick and its related entities) and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its independence from ValueClick.

ADDITIONAL MATTERS BEING SUBMITTED TO A VOTE OF BE FREE STOCKHOLDERS ONLY    

BE FREE PROPOSAL NUMBER TWO: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS    

        Be Free's current board of directors is divided into three classes. A class of directors is elected each year for a three-year term. The current term
of Be Free's Class III Directors will expire at the Be Free annual meeting. The nominees for Class III Director are Gordon B. Hoffstein and Samuel P. Gerace, Jr., each of whom
currently serves as a Class III Director of Be Free and is available for re-election as a Class III Director. The Class III Directors elected at the Be Free annual
meeting will serve for a term of three years which will expire at Be Free's 2005 annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified. However, as discussed below, the
members of the board of directors of Be Free, including the directors elected at Be Free's annual meeting, will resign upon the consummation of the merger. 

        Holders
of proxies solicited by this joint proxy statement/prospectus will vote the proxies received by them as directed on the proxy card or, if no direction is made, for the election
of Gordon B. Hoffstein and Samuel P. Gerace, Jr. to Be Free's board of directors as Class III Directors. Proxies cannot be voted for more than the two named nominees. 

        Each
nominee for election has agreed to serve if elected, and Be Free has no reason to believe that each nominee will be unavailable to serve. If any nominee is unable or declines to
serve as a director at the time of the Be Free annual meeting, the proxy holders will vote for a nominee designated by the present Be Free board of directors to fill the vacancy. Unless otherwise
instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them "
FOR
" the nominees named below. 

        If
the merger is completed, and pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Be Free's current board of directors will resign upon the closing of the merger. The merger agreement
provides that, if the merger is completed, as soon as practicable after the closing of the merger, three members of Be Free's board of directors will be elected to the board of directors of
ValueClick. The merger agreement contemplates that after the closing of the merger, the ValueClick board of directors shall consist of a
total of seven directors, four directors, including Mr. Zarley, designated by ValueClick and three directors designated by Be Free. The three Be Free designees
are                              ,
                              and           
                   .

        Although
it is currently anticipated that the merger will be completed shortly after ValueClick's stockholders and Be Free's stockholders approve the merger proposal at the annual
meetings, the parties cannot guarantee that the merger will be completed as anticipated. If the merger is not completed, the two directors elected at the Be Free annual meeting will hold office until
the 2005 annual meeting of Be Free stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.

Board of Directors  

        Be Free's board of directors oversees Be Free's business and affairs and monitors the performance of its management. In accordance with corporate governance
principles, the Be Free board does not involve itself in day-to-day operations. The directors keep themselves informed through, among other things, discussions with the
chairman, other key executives and the Be Free's principle external advisers (legal counsel, outside auditors, investment bankers and other consultants), reading reports and other materials that Be
Free sends them and participating in board and committee meetings. 

        Be
Free's current board is divided into three classes. A class of directors is elected each year for a three-year term. Be Free's Class I Directors, who will continue
in office until its 2003 annual meeting of stockholders, are W. Michael Humphreys and Kathleen L. Biro. Be Free's Class II Directors, who will continue in office until its 2004 annual meeting
of stockholders, are Ted R. Dintersmith and Jeffrey F. Rayport. Be Free's Class III Directors, whose terms will expire at this year's annual meeting of stockholders, are Gordon B. Hoffstein and

available for re-election as a Class III Director. The Class III Directors elected at this year's annual meeting of stockholders will serve for a term of three years which
will expire at Be Free's 2005 annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified. However, as discussed above, the members of the board of directors of Be Free,
including the directors elected at this annual meeting, will resign upon the consummation of the merger. 

Board Committees and Meetings  

        During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, the Be Free board of directors held six meetings (including by telephone conference). All directors
attended at least 75% of the meetings of the board and of the committees on which they served during fiscal 2001. 

        The
Be Free board of directors has an audit committee and a compensation committee. From time to time during 2001, the board created various ad hoc committees for special purposes. 

Audit Committee  

        The Be Free audit committee currently consists of Messrs. Dintersmith and Rayport and Ms. Biro, none of whom is an employee or consultant of Be
Free. The audit committee reviews the professional services provided by the Be Free's independent auditors, the independence of such auditors from Be Free's management and Be Free's annual financial
statements and system of internal accounting controls. The audit committee also reviews such other matters with respect to Be Free's accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices and
procedures as it may find appropriate or may be brought to its attention. The audit committee was created in September 1999 and held five meetings in 2001. 

Compensation Committee  

        The Be Free compensation committee currently consists of Messrs. Dintersmith and Humphreys, neither of whom is an employee or consultant of Be Free. The
compensation committee reviews executive
salaries, administers Be Free's bonus, incentive compensation and stock plans, and approves the salaries and other benefits of the executive officers of Be Free. In addition, the compensation
committee consults with Be Free's management regarding Be Free's benefit plans and compensation policies and practices. The compensation committee was created in September 1999 and held two
meetings in 2001. 

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  

        No interlocking relationship exists between Be Free's executive officers, board of directors or compensation committee and any executive officer or member of the
board of directors or compensation committee of any other company, nor has any such interlocking relationship existed in the past. 

Director Compensation  

        Be Free's directors do not currently receive salaries or fees for serving as directors or for serving on committees of Be Free's board of directors. Be Free has
no present plans to pay cash compensation to directors but intends to reimburse directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at
meetings of the board of directors or committees of the board. From time to time, Be Free grants its non-employee directors options to purchase shares of Be Free common stock under its
stock incentive plan. In April 2001, Be Free granted each of Messrs. Dintersmith, Humphreys and Rayport and Ms. Biro an option to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock at $1.24
per share that vests monthly over three years. If the merger with ValueClick is consummated, all of the option grants made to Be Free's non-employee directors will accelerate in
full. 

Vote Required  

        The two nominees for director receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them shall be elected as Class III
directors. 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors  

Be Free's board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the election of the Class III director
nominees named above.

Relationships Among Executive Officers and Directors  

        Be Free's executive officers are elected by the board of directors on an annual basis and serve until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. There
are no family relationships among any of the directors or executive officers of Be Free. 

BE FREE SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE    

        Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires Be Free's executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of
a registered class of Be Free equity securities, to file an initial report of securities ownership on Form 3 and reports of changes in securities ownership on Form 4 or 5 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Such executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish Be Free with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they
file. Based solely on Be Free's review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 4 or 5 were required for such persons, Be
Free believes that, for the reporting period from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001, its executive officers and directors complied with all their reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) for such fiscal year. 

BE FREE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND RELATED INFORMATION

was no longer serving as an executive officer on December 31, 2001 (the "Be Free Named Executive Officers") for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. In accordance
with the rules of the SEC, the compensation set forth in the table below does not include medical, group life, or other benefits which are available to all of our salaried employees, and perquisites

Be
Free's standard stock option agreement provides for 25% accelerated vesting upon a change in control event and 100% accelerated vesting if, within two years of such change in
control event, the option holder is terminated for "good reason," including a diminution of authority or responsibility. Options granted to Messrs. Samuel P. Gerace, Jr., Heavey, Pike and
Joseph contain such provisions. Options granted to Mr. Hoffstein contain similar provisions, but provide for 50% accelerated vesting upon a change in control event instead of 25%.

Based
on options to purchase an aggregate of 4,339,823 shares granted to Be Free officers and employees under the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan during the year ended December 31,

The
exercise price per share of each option was determined to be equal to the fair market value per share of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

(4)
The
potential realizable value is calculated based on the term of the option at the time of grant. Stock price appreciation of 5% and 10% is assumed pursuant to rules promulgated by
the SEC and does not represent our prediction of our stock price performance. The potential realizable values at 5% and 10% appreciation are calculated by assuming that the exercise price on the date
of grant appreciates at the indicated rate for the entire term of the option and that the option is exercised at the exercise price and sold on the last day of its term at the appreciated price.

(5)
All
options granted to Mr. Thomas A. Gerace that were unvested were cancelled when Mr. Gerace left Be Free in August 2001.

BE FREE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS, TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
  AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS    

        Be Free's standard stock option and restricted stock agreements provide for 25% accelerated vesting upon a change in control event and 100% accelerated vesting
if, within two years of such change in control event, the option holder or stockholder is terminated for "good reason," including a diminution of authority or responsibility. The terms of these
agreements apply generally to Be Free's employees, directors and officers. Options and restricted stock granted to Mr. Hoffstein provide for 50% accelerated vesting instead of 25%. Pursuant to

BE FREE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION    

        The Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Be Free board of directors has furnished the following report on executive compensation: 

        Be
Free's executive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee, which is comprised of two outside directors, establishes and
administers Be Free's executive compensation policies and plans and administers Be Free's stock option and other equity-related employee compensation plans. The Compensation Committee considers
internal and external information in determining executive officers' compensation, including outside survey data. 

Compensation Philosophy  

        Be Free's compensation policies for executive officers are based on the belief that the interests of executives should be closely aligned with those of Be Free's
stockholders. The compensation policies are designed to achieve the following objectives: 


Offer
compensation opportunities that attract highly-qualified executives, reward outstanding initiative and achievement, and retain the leadership and
skills necessary to build long-term stockholder value.


Maintain
a significant portion of executives' total compensation at risk, tied to both the annual and long-term financial performance of Be Free
and the creation of stockholder value.


Further
Be Free's short and long-term strategic goals and values by aligning compensation with business objectives and individual performance. 

Compensation Program  

        Be Free's executive compensation program has three major integrated components, base salary, annual incentive awards and long term incentives. 

        Base Salary.
    Base salary levels for executive officers are determined annually by reviewing the pay practices of Internet
companies of similar size and market capitalization, the skills, performance level, and contribution to the business of individual executives, and the needs of Be Free. Overall, Be Free believes that
base salaries for its executive officers are competitive with median base salary levels for similar positions in comparable Internet companies. 

        Annual Incentive Awards.
    Be Free's executive officers are eligible to receive annual cash bonus awards designed to motivate
executives to attain short-term and longer-term corporate and individual management goals. The Compensation Committee establishes the annual incentive opportunity for each
executive officer in relation to his or her base salary. Awards under this program are based on the attainment of specific company performance measures and by the achievement of specified individual
objectives and the degree to which each executive officer contributes to the overall success of Be Free and the management team. For 2001, these bonuses were based on sales growth, the successful
execution of Be Free's strategies and other individual objectives, thus establishing a direct link between executive pay and Be Free's growth. 

        Long-Term Incentives.
    The Compensation Committee believes that stock options are an excellent vehicle for
compensating Be Free's officers and employees. Be Free provides long-term incentives through its 1998 Stock Incentive Plan and its 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the purposes of which
are to create a direct link between executive compensation and increases in stockholder value. Stock options are granted at fair market value and vest in installments, generally in 36 monthly
installments after the vesting of the first 25% which occurs upon the one-year anniversary of the grant. When determining option awards for an executive officer, the Compensation Committee
considers the executive's current contribution to Be Free's performance, the anticipated contribution to meeting the Be Free's long-term strategic performance goals, and industry practices
and norms. Long-term 

incentives granted in prior years and existing levels of stock ownership are also taken into consideration. Because the receipt of value by an executive officer under a stock option is dependent upon
an increase in the price of Be Free's common stock, this portion of the executive's compensation is directly aligned with an increase in stockholder value. 

        Stock for Options Program.
    Pursuant to a recommendation of the Compensation Committee, Be Free's board of directors approved
an employee option exchange program, pursuant to which, eligible employees were permitted to surrender stock options for cancellation in exchange for a reduced number of shares of restricted stock. On
January 1, 2001, Be Free issued 875,306 shares of restricted stock to Be Free employees who previously requested to participate in the option exchange program. Under the provisions of the
program, participating employees exchanged two stock options for one share of restricted stock issued under the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan with a purchase price of $0.01 per share. The first 25% of the
restricted stock purchased vests fifteen months from the original stock
option grant date. An additional 25% vests each year after the first vest date, for a period of three years. 

        The
Compensation Committee recommended the employee option exchange program because it believes it is important to align the interests of Be Free's employees with those of its
stockholders. Because many of Be Free's outstanding options had exercise prices that were significantly higher than the then current market price of its common stock, it felt, and the Be Free board of
directors agreed, that it was advisable and in the best interests of Be Free and its stockholders to offer this employee option exchange program to re-establish the alignment of interests.
Because employees participating in the exchange program received shares of restricted stock subject to vesting in an amount less than the shares underlying the options they surrendered, the program
limited the dilution to public stockholders commonly associated with stock option repricing. 

Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer  

        Mr. Hoffstein's base salary, annual incentive award and long-term incentive compensation are determined by the Compensation Committee based
upon the same factors as those employed by the Compensation Committee for executive officers generally. Mr. Hoffstein's current annual base salary is $325,000, subject to annual review and
increase by the Be Free board of directors. As of March 5, 2002, Mr. Hoffstein beneficially owned 3,335,856 shares of Be Free common stock. 

Section 162(m) Limitation  

        Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), generally disallows a deduction to public companies for compensation over
$1,000,000 paid to the company's chief executive officer and four other most highly compensated executive officers. Qualifying performance-based compensation will not be subject to the deduction limit
if certain requirements are met. The Compensation Committee's present intention is to structure its stock option grants and certain other equity-based awards in a manner that complies with
Section 162(m) of the Code unless the Compensation Committee believes that such compliance would not be in the best interest of Be Free or its stockholders. Nevertheless, the Compensation
Committee reserves the right to use its judgement to authorize compensation payments which may be in excess of the Section 162(m) limit when the Committee believes such payments are
appropriate, after taking into consideration changing business conditions or the officer's performance, and are in the best interests of the stockholders.

this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that ValueClick specifically incorporates it by reference in such filing. 

Review with Management  

        The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed Be Free's audited financial statements with management. 

Review and Discussions with Independent Accountants  

        The Audit Committee has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Be Free's independent accountants, the matters required to be discussed by SAS61 (Codification
of Statements on Accounting Standards) which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of Be Free's financial statements. 

        The
Audit Committee has also received written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (which relates to
the accountant's independence from ValueClick and its related entities) and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP their independence from ValueClick. 

Conclusion  

        Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to Be Free's board of directors that Be Free's audited financial statements

ADDITIONAL MATTERS BEING SUBMITTED TO A VOTE OF BE FREE STOCKHOLDERS ONLY    

BE FREE PROPOSAL NUMBER THREE: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS    

        Be Free's board of directors has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent auditors, to audit Be Free's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2002, and recommends that the stockholders vote for ratification of such appointment. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
Be Free's independent auditors, the selection of such auditors will be reconsidered by Be Free's board of directors. A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which served as Be Free's auditors
in fiscal 2001, is expected to be present at the annual meeting to be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders and to make a statement if he or she desires to do so. 

Be Free's board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as Be Free's
independent auditors for the current fiscal year.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS    

        Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in a company's proxy statement and for
consideration at the next annual meeting of its stockholders by submitting their proposals to the company in a timely manner. 

        ValueClick.
    To be included in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the ValueClick annual meeting to be held in
2003, a ValueClick stockholder (including former Be Free stockholders who become ValueClick stockholders) proposal must be received by ValueClick no later than [            ,
2003], and must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8. All stockholder proposals should be sent to: Secretary, ValueClick, Inc., 4360 Park Terrace
Drive, Suite 100, Westlake Village, California 91361 no later than                        , 2003. If ValueClick is not notified of
a stockholder proposal by                        , 2003, then the proxy solicited by
the ValueClick board of directors for the 2003 annual meeting will confer discretionary authority to vote against such stockholder proposal. 

        Be Free.
    If the merger is not completed, proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the Be Free 2003 Annual
Meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, must be received by Be Free no later than December 11, 2002 in order that they may be included in the proxy statement and form of
proxy relating to that meeting. In addition, such proposals must comply with the other requirements of Rule 14a-8. 

        In
addition, Be Free's by-laws require that Be Free be given advance notice of stockholder nominations for election to Be Free's Board of Directors and of other business which
stockholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting of stockholders (other than matters included in Be Free's proxy statement in accordance with Rule 14a-8). The required notice must
be made in writing and delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at Be Free's principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting. However, if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, the required notice of stockholder nominations
must be delivered or received not earlier than the 120
th
 day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90
th
 day
prior to the annual meeting and (ii) the 10
th
 day following the day notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or publicly disclosed. If a stockholder fails to provide
timely notice of a proposal to be presented at the Be Free 2003 Annual Meeting, the proxies designated by the Board of Directors of Be Free will have discretionary authority to vote on any such
proposal. 

Householding of Annual Meeting Materials    

        Some banks, brokers and other nominee record holders may be participating in the practice of "householding" proxy statements and annual reports. This means that
only one copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus or annual report may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household. ValueClick will promptly deliver a separate copy of the joint
proxy statement/prospectus or its annual report to you if you write or call ValueClick at the following address or phone number: 4360 Park Terrace Drive, Suite 100, Westlake Village, CA 91361,

you wish to receive separate copies of an annual report or proxy statement in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for your household, you should
contact your bank, broker, or other nominee record holder, or you may contact ValueClick or Be Free, as applicable, at the above address and phone number. 

OTHER MATTERS    

        The boards of directors of ValueClick and Be Free do not know of any other business to be presented for consideration at the respective annual meetings. If other
matters properly come before the respective stockholder meetings, the persons named in the accompanying respective forms of proxy intend to vote on such matters based on their best judgment. 

        ValueClick

joint proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by a copy of ValueClick's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 as filed
with the SEC, including the financial statements, notes to the financial statements and the financial schedules contained in the report. ValueClick will furnish copies of any exhibits to this report
to each person whose proxy is being solicited, but may charge a reasonable copying charge. Stockholders should address requests for copies of any of these materials to Secretary,
ValueClick, Inc., 4360 Park Terrace Drive, Suite 100, Westlake Village, California 91361.

        ValueClick
or Be Free may engage one or more proxy solicitation firms to assist in obtaining proxies from their respective stockholders on a timely basis. As of the date of this
document, neither ValueClick nor Be Free has engaged a proxy solicitation firm or has committed to the payment of any fees for such service.

STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION    

        The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future
prospects and make informed investment decisions. This document contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may
be made directly in this document referring to ValueClick or Be Free. These statements may include statements regarding the period following completion of the merger. 

        This
document contains forward-looking statements based on current projections about operations, industry, financial condition and liquidity. Words such as "anticipate," "estimate,"
"expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, the merger or our
business, identify forward-looking statements. You should note that the discussion of ValueClick's and Be Free's board of directors' reasons for the merger and the description of their respective
financial advisors opinions contains many forward looking statements that describe beliefs, assumptions and estimates as of the indicated dates and those forward looking expectations may have changed
as of the date of this document. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations or future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions,
are forward-looking statements. Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ
materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. 

        All
forward-looking statements reflect Be Free's and ValueClick's managements' present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. In addition to the risks related to the businesses of ValueClick and Be Free, the uncertainty
concerning the completion of the merger and the matters discussed under "Risk Factors," among others, could cause actual results to be materially adverse from those described in the forward-looking
statements. These factors include: relative value of ValueClick's and Be Free's common stocks, the market's difficulty in valuing ValueClick's and Be Free's business, the failure to realize the
anticipated benefits of the merger and conflicts of interest of directors recommending the merger. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only of
the date of this document or the date indicated in this documents. Neither ValueClick or Be Free is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

        All
subsequent forward-looking statements attributable to ValueClick, Be Free or us or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements contained or referred to in this section.
