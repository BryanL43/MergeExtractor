                        JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS
                 MERGER PROPOSED -- YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

     Digi International Inc. and NetSilicon, Inc. have entered into a merger
agreement that provides for a merger of NetSilicon with a subsidiary of Digi. As
a result of the merger, NetSilicon effectively will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Digi.

     In the merger, Digi will issue to NetSilicon stockholders .65 shares of
Digi common stock for each share of NetSilicon common stock held by them.
Instead of stock, each NetSilicon stockholder may elect to receive cash for some
or all of his shares of NetSilicon, subject to the election and allocation
procedures discussed in this document. The amount of the per-share cash payments
will be determined by multiplying .65 by the average per-share closing price of
Digi common stock on the Nasdaq National Market System over the period of ten
trading days ending on the third trading day before consummation of the merger.
The aggregate maximum amount of cash that Digi will pay NetSilicon stockholders
under the merger agreement is $15 million.

     On           , 200  , the closing price of Digi common stock, which trades
on the Nasdaq National Market System under the symbol "DGII," was $     per
share. If the price of Digi's common stock at the effective time of the merger
was equal to that price, then each share of NetSilicon common stock would be
exchanged either for Digi common stock having a per-share market value of
$     or for cash in the amount calculated in the manner described above.

     Both companies have called special meetings of their stockholders to
consider and vote on proposals relating to the merger. At NetSilicon's meeting,
NetSilicon will ask its stockholders to consider and vote on the approval of the
merger agreement and the merger. At Digi's meeting, Digi will ask its
stockholders to consider and vote on the approval of the issuance of Digi common
stock in the merger. To complete the merger, the stockholders of each company
must approve the applicable merger-related proposal.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus gives you detailed information about
Digi, NetSilicon, and the merger and includes a copy of the merger agreement and
other important documents. We encourage you to read this entire document
carefully before deciding how to vote. IN PARTICULAR, YOU SHOULD READ CAREFULLY
THE "RISK FACTORS" SECTION BEGINNING ON PAGE   FOR A DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS
RISKS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IN EVALUATING THE MERGER.

     Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares you own. To vote
your shares, you may use the enclosed proxy card or you may attend the meeting
held by your company. In the case of NetSilicon stockholders, if you do not
vote, it will have the same effect as voting against approval of the merger
agreement and the merger.

     We are very enthusiastic about the merger and join the members of the two
companies' boards of directors in recommending that you vote "FOR" the proposal
being submitted for your consideration and vote.

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION?

A:  Digi and NetSilicon have agreed to a merger in which NetSilicon will merge
    with a subsidiary of Digi. As a result of the merger, NetSilicon effectively
    will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Digi.

Q:  WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER FOR MY NETSILICON SHARES?

A:  You will receive .65 shares of Digi common stock for each share of
    NetSilicon common stock that you hold. Instead of receiving stock for your
    shares, you may elect to receive cash for some or all of your shares by
    following the procedures discussed in this document. Your election for cash
    may be reduced, however, if the elections by all NetSilicon stockholders
    would cause Digi to pay more than $15 million in cash in the merger, which
    we expect to occur. If you do not make an election, you will receive Digi
    stock for each of your shares of NetSilicon. The amount of the per-share
    cash payments will be determined by multiplying .65 times the average
    per-share closing price of Digi common stock on the Nasdaq National Market
    System over the period of ten trading days ending on the third trading day
    before consummation of the merger.

Q:  ARE THERE ANY LIMITS ON THE VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION THAT I WILL RECEIVE
    FOR MY NETSILICON SHARES?

A:  No, there is neither a minimum nor a maximum value for what you will receive
    in the merger for each of your shares.

Q:  WHAT PERCENTAGE OF DIGI'S COMMON STOCK WILL FORMER NETSILICON STOCKHOLDERS
    OWN AFTER THE MERGER?

A:  We anticipate that former NetSilicon stockholders will hold approximately
    29% of Digi's outstanding shares of common stock after the merger.

Q:  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A:  After carefully reading and considering this joint proxy
    statement/prospectus, please fill out, sign, and date the enclosed proxy
    card and mail it in the enclosed prepaid return envelope as soon as
    possible, so that your shares may be represented and voted at your company's
    stockholders meeting. You may also attend your company's stockholders
    meeting and vote in person.

    For NetSilicon stockholders, there is also enclosed an election form on
    which you may indicate whether you want to receive cash for some or all of
    your NetSilicon shares in the merger. The election form is accompanied by a
    transmittal letter for submitting your shares of NetSilicon to be exchanged
    for the merger consideration.

Q:  WHAT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL IS NEEDED FOR THE MERGER?

A:  NetSilicon Stockholders.  For NetSilicon to complete the merger, the holders
    of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of NetSilicon's voting common stock
    must vote affirmatively to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Each
    of NetSilicon's seven directors and executive officers, owning a total of
    approximately 1.4% of NetSilicon's outstanding voting shares, have entered
    into a voting agreement with Digi in which they have agreed to vote their
    shares in favor of the merger proposal. Sorrento Networks Corporation, the
    holder of NetSilicon's non-voting common stock, is not entitled to vote on
    the merger proposal. The failure to vote by a holder of voting common stock
    is equivalent to a vote against the merger proposal. If the merger proposal
    is not approved, the merger cannot proceed. The board of directors of
    NetSilicon recommends voting "FOR" this proposal.

    Digi Stockholders.  For Digi to complete the merger, the holders of a
    majority of the number of shares of Digi common stock present in person or
    by proxy at the Digi stockholders meeting must vote affirmatively to approve
    the issuance of shares in the merger. The nine directors and executive
    officers of Digi, owning less than one percent of Digi's outstanding shares,
    have entered into a voting agreement with NetSilicon in which they have
    agreed to vote their shares in favor of the proposal to issue shares in the
    merger. If the proposal to issue shares is not approved, the merger cannot
    proceed. The board of directors of Digi recommends voting "FOR" this
    proposal.

Q:  IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY MY BROKER, WILL MY BROKER
    AUTOMATICALLY VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME?

A:  No. Your broker is not permitted to vote your shares without specific
    instructions from you. Unless you follow the directions your broker provides
    you regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares, your shares
    will not be voted.

Q:  CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE SUBMITTED MY PROXY?

A:  Yes. You may change your vote:

     - by writing to the corporate secretary of your company before your
       company's stockholders meeting stating that you are revoking your proxy;

     - by signing a later-dated proxy card and returning it by mail before your
       company's stockholders meeting; or

     - by attending the stockholders meeting and voting in person; merely
       attending the meeting, without voting in person, will not revoke any
       proxy previously delivered by you.

     If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or a bank, you
     should contact your brokerage firm or bank to change your vote.

Q:  WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A:  We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We
    expect to complete the merger shortly after the NetSilicon and Digi
    stockholders meetings are held.

Q:  WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO NETSILICON STOCKHOLDERS?

A:  Generally, you will not recognize a gain or a loss with respect to the
    receipt of Digi common stock in exchange for your shares of NetSilicon
    common stock. Receipt of cash in the merger generally would be taxable. We
    urge you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the specific tax
    consequences of the merger to you.

Q:  DOES DIGI PAY DIVIDENDS?

A:  No. Digi does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock and does
    not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.

Q:  WILL I HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE MY SHARES APPRAISED IF I DISSENT FROM THE
    MERGER?

A:  Under Massachusetts law, holders of NetSilicon common stock who comply with
    the governing statutory provisions are entitled to appraisal rights to
    receive fair value for their shares instead of the merger consideration. A
    copy of the applicable statutes is attached to the joint proxy
    statement/prospectus as Annex G. Holders of Digi common stock are not
    entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Q:  WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANIES?

A:  Both companies file reports and other information with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission. You can read and copy this information at the SEC's
    public reference facilities. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for

THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   .)

     Digi and NetSilicon have entered into a merger agreement that provides for
the merger of NetSilicon into a wholly owned subsidiary of Digi. As a result of
the merger, NetSilicon effectively will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Digi.

THE COMPANIES

11001 Bren Road East
Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343
(952) 912-3444

market technology solutions. The company was founded in 1985, has been publicly
held since 1989, and employs approximately 425 people worldwide. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references to Digi in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus include Digi and its subsidiaries. For further information,
visit Digi's Internet site at http://www.digi.com. Information on Digi's
Internet site is not a part of, and is not being incorporated by reference into,
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, however.

NETSILICON, INC. (SEE PAGE   .)

411 Waverley Oaks Road, Bldg. 227
Waltham, MA 02452
(781) 647-1234

     NetSilicon designs and manufactures integrated solutions for manufacturers
who want to build intelligence and Internet/Ethernet connectivity into their
products. These solutions integrate system-on-silicon and software to provide a
complete platform for Internet/Ethernet-connected devices. NetSilicon is
enabling device intelligence and connectivity in a broad range of industries
including office imaging, industrial automation, telecommunications, building
controls, security, and retail point-of-sale. NetSilicon has been publicly held
since September 15, 1999 and currently employs approximately 130 people
worldwide.

WHAT NETSILICON STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   .)

     NetSilicon stockholders will receive .65 shares of Digi common stock for
each share of NetSilicon common stock that they hold. Instead of stock, each
NetSilicon stockholder may elect to receive cash for some or all of his shares
by following the procedures discussed in this document. Elections for cash may
be reduced on a proportionate basis, however, if the elections by all NetSilicon
stockholders would cause Digi to pay more than $15 million in cash in the
merger. Because Sorrento Networks Corporation, NetSilicon's largest stockholder,
has agreed to elect to receive the maximum amount of cash to which it is

entitled in the merger, we expect this reduction to occur. A NetSilicon
stockholder who does not make a cash election will receive Digi common stock for
all of that holder's NetSilicon shares. The amount of the per-share cash
payments will be determined by multiplying .65 times the average per-share
closing price of Digi common stock on the Nasdaq National Market System over the
period of ten trading days ending on the third trading day before closing of the
merger.

     Digi will not issue fractional shares in the merger. As a result, the total
number of shares of Digi common stock that you receive in the merger will be
rounded down to the nearest whole number. You will receive a cash payment for
the value of the remaining fraction of a share of Digi common stock that you
would otherwise have received, based on the average of the trading prices of
Digi common stock on the Nasdaq National Market System over the period of ten
trading days ending on the third trading day before the closing of the merger.

OWNERSHIP OF DIGI FOLLOWING THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   .)

     We anticipate that former NetSilicon stockholders will own approximately
29% of the outstanding shares of Digi common stock following the merger.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGES   .)

     Digi.  Digi's board of directors unanimously agreed that the merger is
advisable and in the best interests of Digi and its stockholders. In reaching
its decision, Digi's board of directors considered a number of factors,
including the following:

     - the expectation of Digi's management that, although immediately dilutive,
       the merger will be accretive to Digi's earnings per share in later years;

     - the overall strategic fit between Digi and NetSilicon in view of their
       respective product lines and markets;

     - that the complementary nature of the two companies' device connectivity
       products will give the combined company an expanded range of products and
       technology; and

     - that NetSilicon's position as an early entrant in the small but growing
       embedded systems market will allow Digi to further reposition its
       business to address growth markets in device connectivity.

     NetSilicon.  The NetSilicon board of directors believes that the terms of
the merger and the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of,
NetSilicon and its stockholders. In reaching its decision, the NetSilicon board
of directors considered numerous factors, including the following:

     - the financial condition, results of operations, and businesses of
       NetSilicon and Digi before and after giving effect to the merger;

     - the near- and long-term prospects of NetSilicon as an independent company
       and of the combined company;

     - the opportunity for NetSilicon stockholders to participate in the
       potential for greater growth, operational efficiencies, financial
       strength, and earning power of the combined company after the merger;

     - industry trends toward consolidation and the advantages that might be
       expected to accrue to the combined company through the creation of a
       larger customer base, a higher market profile, greater financial
       strength, and broader customer offerings, which could enhance the ability
       of the combined company to compete in the marketplace; and

     - the opinion of Thomas Weisel Partners LLC dated October 29, 2001 to the
       NetSilicon board of directors to the effect that as of that date, and
       based upon and subject to the matters described in their opinion, the
       consideration to be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon was fair,
       from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGES   .)

     Digi Stockholders.  After careful consideration, the Digi board of
directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the
issuance of shares of Digi common stock in the merger.

     NetSilicon Stockholders.  The NetSilicon board of directors believes that
the merger is in the best interests of NetSilicon and its stockholders and,
after careful consideration, recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the
merger agreement and the merger.

OPINIONS OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS (SEE PAGES   .)

     Digi.  BMO Nesbitt Burns Corp. has given a written opinion, dated October
30, 2001, to the Digi board of directors as to the fairness on that date, from a
financial point of view, of the consideration to be paid in the merger. The full
text of this opinion is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex E. You should read the opinion carefully in its entirety to understand the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and limitations on
the review undertaken by Nesbitt Burns in providing its opinion. The opinion of
Nesbitt Burns is directed to the Digi board of directors and does not constitute
a recommendation to any Digi stockholder as to any matter relating to the
merger.

     NetSilicon.  Thomas Weisel Partners LLC has given a written opinion, dated
October 29, 2001, to the NetSilicon board of directors as to the fairness on
that date, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be received
by the holders of NetSilicon common stock in the merger. The full text of this
opinion is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F. You
should read the opinion carefully in its entirety to understand the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken by Thomas Weisel Partners in providing its opinion. The opinion of
Thomas Weisel Partners is directed to the NetSilicon board of directors and does
not constitute a recommendation to any NetSilicon stockholder as to any matter
relating to the merger.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF NETSILICON IN THE MERGER (SEE
PAGES   .)

     In considering the recommendation of NetSilicon's board of directors in
favor of approval of the merger agreement and the merger, NetSilicon
stockholders should be aware that some of NetSilicon's directors and executive
officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition
to, the interests of NetSilicon stockholders generally. NetSilicon's board of
directors was aware of and considered these interests when it considered and
approved the merger agreement. The interests include the potential for those
individuals to obtain positions as directors or officers of Digi, the
acceleration of vesting of certain stock options, the receipt of severance and
other benefits under employment agreements, and the right to continued
indemnification and insurance coverage for the benefit of current and former
NetSilicon directors and officers.

     In addition, Daniel J. Sullivan, NetSilicon's Executive Vice President of
Finance and Operations and Chief Financial Officer, will receive a transaction
bonus of approximately $          after the closing of the merger under his
employment agreement. Under this agreement, Mr. Sullivan will be employed by
Digi as Transition Manager. Digi has also agreed that Cornelius Peterson, VIII,
currently the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of NetSilicon,
will be appointed as a director and officer of Digi at the completion of the
merger. Additionally, NetSilicon has agreed to forgive the payment obligations
of two promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $871,207.80 plus
interest made by Mr. Peterson and provide additional payments necessary to cover
any taxes owed by Mr. Peterson as a result of the forgiveness and the additional
payment. Mr. Peterson will also receive a one-time payment of $740,000 on
December 28, 2001.

THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS (SEE PAGES   .)

     Digi Stockholders.  Digi will hold a special stockholders meeting at
               ,           , Minnesota, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, on

is

, 200  . At the Digi stockholders meeting, you will be entitled to cast one vote

close of business on           , 200  , there were           shares of Digi
common stock outstanding.

     In order for us to complete the merger, Digi stockholders must approve the
issuance of shares of Digi common stock in the merger. The affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of Digi common stock
present in person or by proxy at the Digi stockholders meeting is required to
approve the issuance of shares in the merger.

     On           , 200  , Digi directors and executive officers and persons and
entities affiliated with them owned and were entitled to vote 87,682 shares of
Digi common stock. These shares represented less than one percent of the
outstanding shares of Digi common stock on           , 200  .

     NetSilicon Stockholders.  The special meeting of NetSilicon stockholders
will be held at the offices of NetSilicon, 411 Waverley Oaks Road, Bldg. 227,
Waltham, Massachusetts 02452 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on           , 200  .
You may vote at this meeting if you owned shares of NetSilicon common stock at
the close of business on the record date of           , 200  . In order to
complete the merger, NetSilicon stockholders must vote to approve the merger
agreement and the merger. The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of
the outstanding shares of NetSilicon common stock entitled to vote at the
meeting is required to approve the merger agreement and the merger. If you do
not vote your NetSilicon shares, the effect will be a vote against the approval
of the merger agreement and the merger.

     On           , 200  , directors and executive officers of NetSilicon owned
and were entitled to vote 100,531 shares of NetSilicon common stock. These
shares represented approximately 1.4% of the outstanding voting shares of
NetSilicon common stock on           , 200  .

VOTING AGREEMENTS (SEE PAGE  .)

     Digi.  The nine directors and executive officers of Digi, owning, in the
aggregate, less than one percent of the outstanding Digi common stock on the
record date, have entered into a voting agreement with NetSilicon and have
delivered irrevocable proxies granting to NetSilicon the right to vote all of
the Digi common stock owned by them in favor of the issuance of Digi common
stock in the merger. We have attached a copy of the Digi voting agreement as
Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

     NetSilicon.  Each of the seven directors and executive officers of
NetSilicon, owning in the aggregate approximately 1.4% of the outstanding
NetSilicon voting common stock on the record date, have entered into a voting
agreement with Digi and have delivered irrevocable proxies granting to Digi the
right to vote all of the NetSilicon voting common stock owned by them in favor
of the approval of the merger agreement and the merger. We have attached a copy
of the NetSilicon voting agreement as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGES  .)

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Digi entered into
a stockholder agreement with Sorrento Networks Corporation, holder of all of the
outstanding shares of NetSilicon's non-voting common stock and NetSilicon's
largest stockholder. In that agreement, Sorrento Networks has agreed to the
following terms, among others:

     - Sorrento Networks will not seek any offer for an acquisition of
       NetSilicon by anyone other than Digi;

     - Sorrento Networks will not exercise any statutory appraisal rights to
       which it may be entitled under Massachusetts law;

     - Sorrento will elect to receive the maximum amount of cash available to it
       under the merger agreement;

     - following consummation of the merger, Sorrento Networks will not acquire
       any additional shares of Digi common stock and will not seek to change
       Digi's board of directors; and

     - Sorrento will be subject to limitations on its ability to sell the shares
       of Digi common stock that it receives in the merger.

     A copy of the stockholder agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Annex D.

NETSILICON STOCK OPTIONS (SEE PAGE   .)

     The merger agreement provides for differing treatment of options to
purchase shares of NetSilicon common stock based on the exercise price of those
options. Options with a per-share exercise price of $7.00 or less will be
assumed by Digi and converted into the right to receive shares of Digi common
stock upon exercise. The terms of the options will remain the same except that
the number of Digi shares issuable upon exercise will be .65 times the number of
NetSilicon shares that were issuable upon exercise of the options and that the
per-share exercise price will equal the pre-merger exercise price divided by
 .65. Except for options held by Cornelius Peterson, VIII, to purchase 150,000
shares of NetSilicon common stock at an exercise price of $18.00 per share,
which will also be assumed by Digi in the merger, options with a per-share
exercise price of more than $7.00 will not be assumed by Digi in the merger and
will become exercisable in full for a period of 30 days and then will expire by
their terms, unless those options are exercised during the 30-day period.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGES   .)

     The merger will be treated as a "purchase" for accounting purposes.

TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGES   .)

     The merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. That means that NetSilicon
stockholders would generally not recognize gain or loss on the receipt of shares
of Digi common stock in the merger. Payments of cash under the cash-election
option and cash received in lieu of fractional shares generally would be
taxable. You are urged to consult with your tax advisor to determine the
specific tax consequences of the merger to you.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGES   .)

     Digi.  Under Delaware law, Digi stockholders will not have any appraisal
rights in connection with the merger.

     NetSilicon.  NetSilicon stockholders are entitled under Massachusetts law
to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. To exercise appraisal rights,
a NetSilicon stockholder must:

     - provide written notice to NetSilicon before the taking of the vote of the
       stockholders on the merger proposal, stating his intention to exercise
       appraisal rights;

     - vote against approval of the merger proposal or abstain from voting; and

     - comply with the other procedures required by Sections 85 to 98 of the
       Massachusetts Business Corporation Law.

     A copy of the applicable sections of Massachusetts law is attached to this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex G.

REGULATORY APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR THE MERGER (SEE PAGE   .)

     We are not aware of any significant regulatory approvals currently required
for the merger.

MATERIAL TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

     Conditions to Completion of the Merger (See page   .)  Digi and NetSilicon
will not be required to complete the merger unless specified conditions are
satisfied, including:

     - approval by Digi stockholders of the issuance of Digi common stock in the
       merger and approval by NetSilicon stockholders of the merger agreement
       and the merger;

     - the effectiveness of the registration statement (which includes this
       document) relating to the Digi shares to be issued in the merger;

     - the authorization for listing on the Nasdaq National Market System,
       subject to official notice of issuance, of the shares of Digi common
       stock to be issued in the merger;

     - all waiting periods, if any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
       Improvements Act having expired or having been terminated and all
       material foreign antitrust approvals having been obtained;

     - there not being an injunction prohibiting the merger, nor any litigation
       or administrative proceeding by any governmental, regulatory, or
       administrative entity pending that is reasonably likely to prohibit the
       merger or to have a material adverse effect on the combined company;

     - compliance in all material respects by Digi and NetSilicon with their
       respective agreements and obligations under the merger agreement, and the
       truth and correctness of the representations made by each of them under
       the merger agreement, both as of the date of the merger agreement and
       immediately before the merger, except to the extent that any inaccuracy
       in any representation, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
       is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Digi or
       NetSilicon, as the case may be;

     - there not having occurred any event that, individually or in the
       aggregate, has had or would be reasonably likely to have a material
       adverse effect on Digi or NetSilicon; and

     - each party receiving an opinion of counsel that the merger will be
       treated as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes.

     Termination of the Merger Agreement (See page   .)  Digi and NetSilicon can
jointly agree to terminate the merger agreement at any time before completing
the merger. In addition, either company can terminate the merger agreement if:

     - the merger has not been completed by March 15, 2002;

     - the NetSilicon stockholders fail to approve the merger agreement and the
       merger or the Digi stockholders fail to approve the issuance of Digi
       shares in the merger;

     - any of the conditions set forth in the second, third, fourth or fifth
       bullet points of "Conditions to Completion of the Merger" above become
       impossible to fulfill on or before March 15, 2002;

     - either of the conditions set forth in the sixth or seventh bullet points
       of "Conditions to Completion of the Merger" above become, with respect to
       the other party, impossible to fulfill on or before March 15, 2002; or

     - the other company's board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies
       its recommendation that its stockholders vote in favor of the proposal
       required to complete the merger.

     The merger agreement may also be terminated by NetSilicon if, at any time
before the NetSilicon stockholders meeting, NetSilicon receives an unsolicited
acquisition offer from a third party, and the board of directors of NetSilicon
determines the offer is reasonably likely to be more favorable to NetSilicon's
stockholders than the merger with Digi. However, before terminating the merger
agreement, NetSilicon

must have given Digi at least five business days' notice and, during that
period, a chance to propose such amendments to the terms of the merger agreement
as would enable NetSilicon's board of directors to determine that the merger
with Digi, as so amended, is at least as favorable to NetSilicon's stockholders
as the third party's offer.

     A Termination Fee Will Be Payable by NetSilicon Under Certain Circumstances
(See page   .) NetSilicon will be obligated to pay Digi a termination fee of
$2.5 million, plus an amount, not to exceed $750,000, to reimburse Digi's
expenses relating to the merger, if:

     - Digi terminates the agreement as a result of the NetSilicon board of
       directors having withdrawn or adversely modified its recommendation of
       approval of the merger agreement and the merger;

     - NetSilicon terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into an
       alternative transaction that the NetSilicon board of directors has
       determined is reasonably likely to be more favorable to NetSilicon's
       stockholders than the merger with Digi, as described in the second
       paragraph under "-- Termination of the Merger Agreement" above; or

     - if the following conditions occur:

      - an alternative transaction is proposed to NetSilicon and becomes
        publicly known before termination of the merger agreement;

      - NetSilicon or Digi terminates the merger agreement as a result of the
        merger not having been completed by March 15, 2002, or the stockholders
        of either company having failed to approve the proposal relating to the
        merger on which they are voting; and

      - within 12 months after termination, NetSilicon completes an alternative
        transaction with a third party.

     Restrictions on Alternative Transactions (See page   .)  NetSilicon has
agreed not to solicit an acquisition proposal from a third party while the
merger is pending. NetSilicon has also agreed not to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an acquisition proposal unless the NetSilicon board of
directors determines that the unsolicited proposal is reasonably likely to be
more favorable to NetSilicon's stockholders than the merger with Digi and that
any required financing is committed or reasonably capable of being obtained by
the third party. In addition, NetSilicon has agreed to keep Digi informed about
any inquiries or discussions relating to any alternative transaction that is
proposed by a third party.

RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF NETSILICON AFFILIATES TO SELL DIGI STOCK (SEE
PAGE   .)

     All shares of Digi common stock that NetSilicon stockholders receive in
connection with the merger will be freely transferable unless the holder is

sold only pursuant to a registration statement or an exemption under the
Securities Act of 1933. Sorrento Networks is not considered an affiliate of

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On November 6, 2001, Digi reported in a press release its earnings for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2001. Digi adopted the provisions of Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,"
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The implementation guidelines of SAB
101 require that the accounting effects of the adoption of SAB 101 must be
reflected retroactively to October 1, 2000, the first day of fiscal 2001.

     Digi's fiscal 2001 revenue, including the impact of the adoption of SAB
101, was $130.4 million, compared to revenue of $132.5 million in fiscal 2000.
Excluding the impact of the adoption of SAB 101, fiscal 2001 revenue was $124.1
million, compared to $132.5 million in fiscal 2000. Revenue for the fourth
quarter ended September 30, 2001 was $32.3 million, including the impact of the
adoption of SAB 101, and $26.4 million excluding the impact of adoption of SAB
101, compared to revenue of $34.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.

     Digi's fiscal 2001 net loss, including the impact of SAB 101 was
$1,783,304, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $16,824,680,
or $1.12 per diluted share for fiscal 2000. Digi's fiscal 2001 income before the
cumulative effect of accounting change, was $118,549, or $0.00 per diluted
share.

     Digi's fiscal 2001 gross margin was 49.2%, compared to 52.6% for fiscal
2000.

     Digi's fiscal 2001 operating expenses were $66,424,084, or 50.9% of fiscal
2001 revenue, compared to $101,483,877 for fiscal 2000, or 76.6% of fiscal 2000

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On November 28, 2001, NetSilicon issued a press release reporting its
financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2002, which ended October 27,
2001. NetSilicon reported revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2002 of $7.2
million, compared with $10.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 and
$7.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. NetSilicon posted a net loss
of $1.2 million, or $0.08 per share, excluding certain non-recurring operating
expenses of approximately $1.8 million primarily related to legal costs, costs
associated with the proposed acquisition by Digi, and severance expenses.
Including the non-recurring items, net loss for the third quarter was $3.0
million, or $0.21 per share. This net loss compares with net income of $672,000,
or $0.04 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago and a net loss of
$2.3 million, or $0.16 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Cash
and short-term investments totaled $10.8 million at October 27, 2001, compared
with $11.3 million as of July 28, 2001.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully read and consider
the following factors in evaluating the proposal relating to the merger to be
voted on at your company's meeting of stockholders.

RISKS RELATING TO THE MERGER

  DIGI MAY FAIL TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

     The merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously
operated independently. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the
ability of Digi to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and synergies
from combining the businesses of Digi with the businesses of NetSilicon. For
Digi to realize the anticipated benefits of this combination, members of its
management team must develop strategies and implement a business plan that will
effectively:

     - take advantage of the anticipated synergies related to the companies'
       product lines, markets, and distribution channels;

     - realize the anticipated opportunities for selling, joint-product
       development, and joint-marketing and distribution of the products of Digi
       and NetSilicon;

     - increase revenues from new products;

     - take advantage of cost savings through reductions in costs;

     - integrate the policies, procedures, and operations of Digi and
       NetSilicon;

     - retain and attract key employees of the combined company, including
       technical and sales personnel, during a period of transition and in light
       of the competitive employment market; and

     - while integrating the combined company's operations, maintain adequate
       focus on the companies' core businesses in order to take advantage of
       competitive opportunities and to respond to competitive challenges.

     If members of the management team of Digi are not able to develop
strategies and implement a business plan that achieve these objectives, the
anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized. In particular,
anticipated growth in earnings per share may not be realized, which could have
an adverse impact on the market price of shares of Digi common stock.

 THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL BE GREATER IN NUMBER THAN
 THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH EACH COMPANY INDIVIDUALLY, AND SOME OF THESE RISKS MAY BE
 EXACERBATED BY THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO COMPANIES.

     Digi and NetSilicon each face a number of risks in the operation of their
businesses. Some of these risks are common to both companies, but some are
specific to each particular company. The risks associated with the combined
company will therefore be greater in number than those associated with each
company individually. Digi may not be successful in addressing these risks, and
some of these risks may be exacerbated by reason of the merger.

 BECAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF DIGI COMMON STOCK WILL VARY, NETSILICON
 STOCKHOLDERS CANNOT BE SURE OF THE VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION THEY WILL RECEIVE
 IN THE MERGER.

     For each share of NetSilicon common stock they hold at the effective time
of the merger, NetSilicon stockholders will receive .65 shares of Digi common
stock (or an approximately equivalent value in cash). There is no maximum or
minimum value imposed on the per-share consideration that NetSilicon
stockholders will receive in the merger. Because the market price of Digi common
stock will fluctuate based on general market and economic conditions, Digi's
business and prospects, and other factors, the

value of the shares of Digi common stock actually received by NetSilicon
stockholders will vary, even after the date of the NetSilicon stockholders
meeting.

 FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT NETSILICON'S OR DIGI'S
 STOCK PRICE AND FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, NetSilicon or Digi, or both,
may be subject to the following risks:

     - if the merger is terminated and NetSilicon's board of directors
       determines to seek another business combination, NetSilicon may not be
       able to find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive
       price than the price to be paid in the merger;

     - if the merger is terminated and Digi's board of directors determines to
       seek another business combination, Digi may not be able to find a
       business opportunity as attractive as is presented by the merger;

     - various costs related to the merger, including legal, accounting, and
       financial advisory fees, must be paid by each company even if the merger
       is not completed and, in some cases, a termination fee and expense
       reimbursement must be paid by NetSilicon to Digi; and

     - the price of the common stock of either or both companies may decline to
       the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the
       merger will be completed.

 OUR COSTS RELATED TO THE MERGER MAY BE SIGNIFICANT.

     We expect to incur merger-related expenses of approximately $6.5 million
through the quarter in which the merger occurs. These expenses include legal,
financial advisory, and accounting fees for both companies, regulatory filing
fees, financial printing, and listing fees. This estimate does not include the
anticipated costs associated with restructuring, integrating, and consolidating
the operations of the two companies. Digi expects that the savings from the
elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of other efficiencies
related to the integration of the businesses may offset or exceed any additional
expenses in the future. However, Digi may not be able to achieve a net benefit
in the near future, or at all. Moreover, combining the businesses, even if
achieved in an efficient and effective manner, may not result in combined
financial results that are better than those that Digi and NetSilicon would have
accomplished independently.

RISKS RELATING TO DIGI

 DIGI'S DEPENDENCE ON NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
 THAT CHARACTERIZES DIGI'S INDUSTRY MAKE IT SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOSS OF MARKET SHARE
 RESULTING FROM COMPETITORS' PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND SIMILAR RISKS.

     The data communications industry is characterized by rapidly changing
technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions,
short product life cycles and rapidly changing customer requirements. The
introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new
industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable.
Digi's future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing
products, to introduce new products to meet changing customer requirements and
emerging technologies, and to demonstrate the performance advantages and
cost-effectiveness of its products over competing products. Any failure by Digi
to modify its products to support new alternative technologies or any failure to
achieve widespread customer acceptance of such modified products could cause
Digi to lose market share and cause its revenues to decline.

     Digi may experience delays in developing and marketing product enhancements
or new products that respond to technological change, evolving industry
standards and changing customer requirements. There can be no assurance that
Digi will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful
development, introduction, and marketing of these products or product
enhancements, or that its new

products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the
marketplace and achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market
acceptance in existing or additional markets. Failure by Digi, for technological
or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements
in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on
Digi. In addition, the future introductions or announcements of products by Digi
or one of its competitors embodying new technologies or changes in industry
standards or customer requirements could render Digi's then-existing products
obsolete or unmarketable. There can be no assurance that the introduction or
announcement of new product offerings by Digi or one or more of its competitors
will not cause customers to defer the purchase of Digi's existing products,
which could cause its revenues to decline.

 DIGI INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ITS RESEARCH AND
 DEVELOPMENT, WHICH, IF NOT SUCCESSFUL, COULD CAUSE A DECLINE IN ITS REVENUES
 AND HARM ITS BUSINESS.

     Digi intends to continue to devote significant resources to research and
development in the coming years to enhance and develop additional products. For
the fiscal years ended 2000, 1999, and 1998, Digi's research and development
expenses comprised 15.2%, 11.3%, and 8.7%, respectively, of total net sales. If
Digi is unable to develop new products as a result of its research and
development efforts, or if the products Digi develops are not successful, its
business could be harmed. Even if Digi develops new products that are accepted
by its target markets, the net revenues from these products may not be
sufficient to justify its investment in research and development.

 CERTAIN OF DIGI'S PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ITS REVENUE
 ARE SOLD INTO MATURE MARKETS, WHICH COULD LIMIT DIGI'S ABILITY TO GENERATE
 REVENUE FROM THESE PRODUCTS.

     Certain of Digi's products provide asynchronous and synchronous data
transmissions via add-on cards. The market for add-on asynchronous and
synchronous data communications cards is a mature market. These products
currently generate a substantial majority of Digi's revenues. As the overall
market for these products decreases due to the adoption of newer technologies,
Digi expects that its revenues from these products will continue to decline. As
a result, Digi's future prospects depend in large part on its ability to acquire
or develop and successfully market additional products that address growth
markets.

 DIGI'S FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PRODUCT TRANSITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
 ADVERSE EFFECT ON DIGI'S REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

     From time to time, Digi or its competitors may announce new products,
capabilities, or technologies that may replace or shorten the life cycles of
Digi's existing products. Announcements of currently planned or other new
products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing Digi's products until
new products become available. Furthermore, the introduction of new or enhanced
products requires Digi to manage the transition from older product inventories
and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet
customer demand. Digi's failure to effectively manage transitions from older
products could have a material adverse effect on Digi's revenues and
profitability.

 DIGI'S FAILURE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN ITS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET COULD
 RESULT IN REDUCED PRICES AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE.

     The market in which Digi operates is characterized by rapid technological
advances and evolving industry standards. The market can be significantly
affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry
participants. Digi competes for customers on the basis of product performance in
relation to compatibility, support, quality and reliability, product development
capabilities, price, and availability. Certain of Digi's competitors and
potential competitors have greater financial, technological, manufacturing,
marketing, and personnel resources than Digi. Present and future competitors may
be able to identify new markets and develop more quickly products which are
superior to those developed by Digi. They may also adapt new technologies
faster, devote greater resources to research and development, promote products
more aggressively, and price products more competitively than Digi. There are no

assurances that competition will not intensify or that Digi will be able to
compete effectively in the markets in which Digi competes.

 DIGI'S CONCENTRATED CUSTOMER BASE INCREASES THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON
 DIGI FROM THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE CUSTOMERS.

     Digi's products have historically been sold into highly concentrated
customer markets. Two customers comprised more than 10% of net sales each during
the fiscal years ended 2000, 1999, and 1998: Tech Data at 13.4%, 15.4%, and
13.7%, respectively, and Ingram Micro at 10.0%, 13.4%, and 15.5%, respectively.
Digi's sales are primarily made on the basis of purchase orders rather than
under long-term agreements, and therefore, any customer could cease purchasing
Digi's products at any time without penalty. The decision of any key customer to
cease using Digi's products or a material decline in the number of units
purchased by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on
Digi's revenues.

  THE LONG AND VARIABLE SALES CYCLE FOR DIGI'S PRODUCTS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT
  FOR DIGI TO PREDICT ITS OPERATING RESULTS AND MANAGE ITS BUSINESS.

     The sale of Digi's products typically involves a significant technical
evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by potential customers,
as well as delays frequently associated with customers' internal procedures to
deploy new technologies within their products and to test and accept new
technologies. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with
Digi's products is typically lengthy and is subject to a number of significant
risks, including customers' internal acceptance reviews, that are beyond Digi's
control. Because of the lengthy sales cycle and the large size of customer
orders, if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter
are not realized in that quarter, Digi's operating results for that quarter
could be materially adversely affected.

 DIGI DEPENDS ON MANUFACTURING RELATIONSHIPS AND ON LIMITED-SOURCE SUPPLIERS,
 AND ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO DIGI'S CUSTOMER
 RELATIONSHIPS.

     Digi procures all parts and certain services involved in the production of
its products and subcontracts most of its product manufacturing to outside firms
that specialize in such services. Although most of the components of Digi's
products are available from multiple vendors, Digi has several single-source
supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or
because the relationship is advantageous to Digi. There can be no assurance that
Digi's suppliers will be able to meet Digi's future requirements for products
and components in a timely fashion. In addition, the availability of many of
these components to Digi is dependent in part on Digi's ability to provide its
suppliers with accurate forecasts of its future requirements. Delays or lost
sales could be caused by other factors beyond Digi's control, including late
deliveries by vendors of components. If Digi is required to identify alternative
suppliers for any of its required components, qualification and pre-production
periods could be lengthy and may cause delays in providing products to
customers. Any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components
currently obtained from limited sources could disrupt Digi's operations and have
a material adverse effect on Digi's customer relationships and profitability.

  DIGI'S ABILITY TO COMPETE COULD BE JEOPARDIZED IF DIGI IS UNABLE TO PROTECT
ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

     Digi's ability to compete depends in part on its proprietary rights and
technology. Although Digi has certain patents and patent applications and may
seek additional patents where appropriate for proprietary technology, Digi's
proprietary technology and products are generally not patented. Digi relies
primarily on the copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws to protect its
proprietary rights in its products.

     Digi generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees,
and sometimes with its customers and potential customers, and limits access to
the distribution of its proprietary information. There can be no assurance that
the steps taken by Digi in this regard will be adequate to prevent the
misappropriation of its technology. Digi's pending patent applications may be
denied and any patents, once issued, may be circumvented by Digi's competitors.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others

will not develop technologies that are superior to Digi's. Despite Digi's
efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to
copy aspects of its products or to obtain and use information that Digi regards
as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
Digi's proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. There
can be no assurance that Digi's means of protecting its proprietary rights in
the United States or abroad will be adequate or that competing companies will
not independently develop similar technology. Digi's failure to adequately
protect its proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on Digi's
competitive position and result in loss of revenue.

 FROM TIME TO TIME, DIGI IS SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AND LITIGATION REGARDING
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM DIGI AND REQUIRE DIGI
 TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS.

     The data communications industry is characterized by frequent litigation
regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, Digi
receives notification of a third-party claim that its products infringe other
intellectual property rights. Any litigation to determine the validity of
third-party infringement claims, whether or not determined in Digi's favor or
settled by Digi, would at a minimum be costly and divert the efforts and
attention of Digi's management and technical personnel from productive tasks,
which could have a material adverse effect on Digi's ability to operate its
business and service the needs of its customers. There can be no assurance that
any infringement claims by third parties, if proven to have merit, will not
materially adversely affect Digi's business or financial condition. In the event
of an adverse ruling in any such matter, Digi may be required to pay substantial
damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue
the use of certain processes or be required to obtain a license under the
intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement. There can
be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all.
Any limitations on Digi's ability to market its products, or delays and costs
associated with redesigning its products or payments of license fees to third
parties, or any failure by Digi to develop or license a substitute technology on
commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on its
business and financial condition.

 DIGI FACES RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND EXPANSION
 THAT COULD IMPAIR ITS ABILITY TO GROW ITS REVENUES ABROAD.

     In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, net sales to
customers outside the United States, primarily in Europe, were approximately
34.8%, 34.8%, and 25.5%, respectively, of total net sales.

     Digi believes that its future growth is dependent in part upon its ability
to increase sales in international markets. These sales are subject to a variety
of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import
restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in regulatory
requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and potentially adverse
tax consequences, and export license requirements. In addition, Digi is subject
to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including
political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and
trade relationships. There can be no assurance that one or more of these factors
will not have a material adverse effect on Digi's business strategy and
financial condition.

  IF DIGI LOSES KEY PERSONNEL IT COULD PREVENT DIGI FROM EXECUTING ITS BUSINESS
STRATEGY.

     Digi's business and prospects depend to a significant degree upon the
continuing contributions of its executive officers and its key technical
personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no
assurance that Digi will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified
personnel. Failure to attract and retain key personnel could result in Digi's
failure to execute its business strategy.

 ANY ACQUISITIONS DIGI HAS MADE OR WILL MAKE COULD DISRUPT ITS BUSINESS AND
 SERIOUSLY HARM ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION.

     Digi will continue to consider acquisitions of complementary businesses,
products or technologies. In the event of any future purchases, Digi could:

     - issue stock that would dilute Digi's current stockholders' percentage
       ownership;

     - incur debt;

     - assume liabilities; or

     - incur large and immediate write-offs.

     Digi's operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks,
including:

     - problems combining the purchased operations, technologies, or products;

     - unanticipated costs;

     - diversion of management's attention from Digi's core business;

     - difficulties integrating businesses in different countries and cultures;

     - adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
       customers;

     - risks associated with entering markets in which Digi has no or limited
       prior experience; and

     - potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the purchased
       organization.

     Digi cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully integrate any
businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that Digi has acquired or that
Digi might acquire in the future and any failure to do so could disrupt its
business and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and
results of operations. Moreover, from time to time Digi may enter into
negotiations for a proposed acquisition, but be unable or unwilling to
consummate the acquisition under consideration. This could cause significant
diversion of management's attention and out-of-pocket expenses to Digi. Digi
could also be exposed to litigation as a result of an unconsummated acquisition,

confidential information.

RISKS RELATING TO NETSILICON

 NETSILICON HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT THAT MAKE FUTURE
 OPERATING RESULTS AND PROFITABILITY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

     NetSilicon incurred net losses from continuing operations for the fiscal
years ended January 31, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2001. At January 31, 2001,
NetSilicon had an accumulated deficit of $3.6 million. There can be no assurance
that NetSilicon will be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual
basis in the future. In addition, revenue growth is not necessarily indicative
of future operating results and there can be no assurance that NetSilicon will
be able to sustain revenue growth. NetSilicon continues to invest significant
financial resources in product development, marketing and sales, and a failure
of such expenditures to result in significant increases in revenue could have a
material adverse effect on NetSilicon. Due to the limited history and
undetermined market acceptance of its new products, the rapidly evolving nature
of its business and markets, potential changes in product standards that
significantly influence many of the markets for its products, the high level of
competition in the industries in which it operates and the other factors
described elsewhere in "Risks Relating to NetSilicon," there can be no assurance
that NetSilicon's investment in these areas will result in increases in revenue
or that any revenue growth that is achieved can be sustained. NetSilicon's
history of losses, coupled with the factors described below, make future
operating results difficult to predict. NetSilicon and its future prospects must
be considered in light of the risks, costs and difficulties frequently
encountered by emerging companies. As a result, there can be no assurance that
NetSilicon will be profitable in any future period.

 THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF NETSILICON'S QUARTERLY RESULTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
 TRADING PRICE OF ITS COMMON STOCK.

     NetSilicon's net sales and operating results have in the past and may in
the future fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter and from year to
year. These results have varied significantly due to a number of factors,
including:

     - market acceptance of and demand for NetSilicon's products and those of
       its customers;

     - unanticipated delays or problems in the introduction of its products;

     - the timing of large customer orders;

     - the timing and success of its customers' development cycles;

     - NetSilicon's ability to introduce new products in accordance with
       customer design requirements and design cycles;

     - new product announcements or product introductions by NetSilicon and its
       competitors;

     - availability and cost of manufacturing sources for NetSilicon's products;

     - the volume of orders that are received and can be filled in a quarter;

     - the rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers;

     - changes in product mix;

     - timing of "design wins" with NetSilicon's customers and related revenue;
       and

     - changes in currency exchange rates.

     NetSilicon's operating results could also be harmed by:

     - the growth rate of markets into which NetSilicon sells its products;

     - changes in the mix of sales to customers and sales representatives;

     - costs associated with protecting NetSilicon's intellectual property; and

     - changes in product costs and pricing by NetSilicon and its competitors.

     NetSilicon budgets expenses based in part on future revenue projections.
NetSilicon may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner in response to
any unanticipated declines in revenues.

     As a result of these and other factors, investors should not rely solely
upon period-to-period comparisons of NetSilicon's operating results as an
indication of future performance. It is likely that in some future period
NetSilicon's operating results or business outlook will be below the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, which would likely result in a
significant reduction in the market price of the shares of common stock.

 NETSILICON'S FAILURE TO INCREASE SALES TO MANUFACTURERS OF INTELLIGENT,
 NETWORK-ENABLED DEVICES AND OTHER EMBEDDED SYSTEMS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS
 FINANCIAL RESULTS.

     NetSilicon's financial performance and future growth are dependent upon its
ability to sell its products to manufacturers of intelligent, network-enabled
devices and other embedded systems in various markets, including markets in
which networking solutions for embedded systems have not historically been sold,
such as the industrial automation equipment, data acquisition and test
equipment, Internet devices and security equipment markets. A substantial
portion of NetSilicon's recent development efforts have been directed toward the
development of new products for markets that are new and rapidly evolving. There
can be no assurance that:

     - the additional intelligent device markets targeted by NetSilicon for its
       products and services will develop;

     - developers within each market targeted by NetSilicon will choose its
       products and services to meet their needs;

     - NetSilicon will successfully develop products to meet the
       industry-specific requirements of developers in its targeted markets or
       that design wins will result in significant sales; or

     - developers in NetSilicon's targeted markets will gain market acceptance
       for their devices which incorporate its products.

     NetSilicon has limited experience in designing its products to meet the
requirements of developers in these industries. Moreover, NetSilicon's products
and services have, to date, achieved limited acceptance in these industries.

  NETSILICON IS DEPENDENT ON THE IMAGING MARKET FOR A LARGE PORTION OF ITS
REVENUES.

     The imaging market has historically accounted for substantially all of
NetSilicon's revenues. In the fiscal years ended January 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, 79%, 95% and 95%, respectively, of NetSilicon's revenues were generated
from customers in the imaging market. NetSilicon's success has been and
continues to be dependent on the continued success of the imaging market. Many
of NetSilicon's customers face competition from larger, more established
companies which may exert competitive or other pressures on them. Any decline in
sales to the imaging market would have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon's
business, results of operations and financial condition.

     Due in part to an economic slowdown affecting NetSilicon's imaging
customers, NetSilicon anticipates a decline in imaging revenue growth in fiscal
year 2002 which will adversely affect its results of operations and financial
condition.

     The imaging market is characterized by declining prices of existing
products and a transition from higher priced network interface cards to
semiconductor devices. Therefore, continual improvements in manufacturing
efficiencies and the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing
products are required for NetSilicon to maintain its gross margins. In response
to customer demands or competitive pressures, or to pursue new product or market
opportunities, NetSilicon may take certain pricing or marketing actions, such as
price reductions or volume discounts. These actions could have a material
adverse effect on NetSilicon.

     A significant amount of NetSilicon's customers in the imaging market are
headquartered in Japan. NetSilicon's customers are subject to declines in their
local economies, which have affected them from time to time in the past and may
affect them in the future. The success of NetSilicon's customers affects their
purchases from NetSilicon.

 NETSILICON'S HIGHLY CONCENTRATED CUSTOMER BASE INCREASES THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE
 EFFECT ON NETSILICON FROM THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE CUSTOMERS.

     NetSilicon's products have historically been sold into the imaging markets
for use in products such as printers, scanners, fax machines, copiers and
multi-function peripherals. This market is highly concentrated. Accordingly,
NetSilicon's sales are derived from a limited number of customers, with the top
five OEM customers accounting for 55%, 72% and 52% of total revenues for the
fiscal years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In particular, sales to
Dimatech, which was acquired by NetSilicon in February 2001, and Ricoh accounted
for 23% and 20% of total revenues, respectively, for the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2001. NetSilicon expects that a small number of customers will
continue to account for a substantial portion of its total revenues for the
foreseeable future. All of NetSilicon's sales are made on the basis of purchase
orders rather than under long-term agreements, and therefore, any customer could
cease purchasing NetSilicon's products at any time without penalty. The decision
of any key customer to cease using NetSilicon's products or a material decline
in the number of units purchased by a significant customer would have a material
adverse effect on NetSilicon.

 THE LONG AND VARIABLE SALES CYCLE FOR NETSILICON'S PRODUCTS MAKES IT MORE
 DIFFICULT FOR NETSILICON TO PREDICT ITS OPERATING RESULTS AND MANAGE ITS
 BUSINESS.

     The sale of NetSilicon's products typically involves a significant
technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by potential
customers, as well as delays frequently associated with customers' internal
procedures to deploy new technologies within their products and to test and
accept new technologies. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated
with NetSilicon's products is typically lengthy, lasting nine months or longer,
and is subject to a number of significant risks, including customers' internal
acceptance reviews, that are beyond NetSilicon's control. Because of the lengthy
sales cycle and the large size of customer orders, if orders forecasted for a
specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter,
NetSilicon's operating results for that quarter could be materially adversely
affected.

 NETSILICON'S RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF BACKLOG INCREASES THE POTENTIAL
 VARIABILITY OF NETSILICON'S QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS.

     NetSilicon's backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not
sufficient to achieve expected sales for the quarter. To achieve its sales
objectives, NetSilicon is dependent upon obtaining orders during each quarter
for shipment during that quarter. Furthermore, NetSilicon's agreements with its
customers typically permit them to change delivery schedules.

     Non-imaging customers may cancel orders within specified time frames
(typically 30 days or more prior to the scheduled shipment date under
NetSilicon's policies) without significant penalty. NetSilicon's customers have
in the past built, and may in the future build, significant inventory in order
to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major products or for other
reasons. Decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels have led
and could lead to reductions in their purchases from NetSilicon. These
reductions, in turn, have caused and could cause adverse fluctuations in
NetSilicon's operating results.

 NETSILICON'S DEPENDENCE ON NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL
 CHANGE THAT CHARACTERIZES NETSILICON'S INDUSTRY MAKE IT SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOSS OF
 MARKET SHARE RESULTING FROM COMPETITORS' PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND SIMILAR
 RISKS.

     The semiconductor and networking industries are characterized by rapidly
changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product
introductions, short product life cycles and rapidly changing customer
requirements. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the
emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and
unmarketable. NetSilicon's future success will depend on its ability to enhance
its existing products, to introduce new products to meet changing customer
requirements and emerging technologies, and to demonstrate the performance
advantages and cost-effectiveness of our products over competing products. Any
failure by NetSilicon to modify its products to support new local-area network,
or LAN, wide-area network, or WAN, and Internet technologies, or alternative
technologies, or any failure to achieve widespread customer acceptance of such
modified products could have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon.

     NetSilicon has in the past and may in the future experience delays in
developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to
technological change, evolving industry standards and changing customer
requirements. There can be no assurance that NetSilicon will not experience
difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development,
introduction and marketing of these products or product enhancements, or that
its new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements
of the marketplace and achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market
acceptance in existing or additional markets. Failure by NetSilicon, for
technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products and
product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner would have a material
adverse effect on NetSilicon. In addition, the future introductions or
announcements of products by NetSilicon or one of its competitors embodying new
technologies or changes in industry standards or customer requirements could
render NetSilicon's then-existing products obsolete or

unmarketable. There can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of
new product offerings by NetSilicon or one or more of its competitors will not
cause customers to defer the purchase of NetSilicon's existing products. Such
deferment of purchases could have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon.

 NETSILICON'S FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PRODUCT TRANSITIONS COULD HAVE A
 MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON NETSILICON.

     From time to time, NetSilicon or its competitors may announce new products,
capabilities or technologies that may replace or shorten the life cycles of
NetSilicon's existing products. Announcements of currently planned or other new
products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing NetSilicon's products
until new products become available. Furthermore, the introduction of new or
enhanced products requires NetSilicon to manage the transition from older
product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be
delivered to meet customer demand. NetSilicon's failure to effectively manage
transitions from older products could have a material adverse effect on
NetSilicon's business, results of operations and financial condition.

 NETSILICON'S FAILURE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN ITS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET
 COULD RESULT IN REDUCED PRICES AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE.

     The markets in which NetSilicon operates are intensely competitive and
characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards,
declining average selling prices and frequent new product introductions. A
number of companies offer products that compete with one or more elements of
NetSilicon's products. NetSilicon believes that the competitive factors
affecting the market for its products include product performance, price and
quality, product functionality and features, the availability of products for
existing and future platforms, the ease of integration with other hardware and
software components of the customer's products, and the quality of support
services, product documentation and training. The relative importance of each of
these factors depends upon the specific customer involved. There can be no
assurance that NetSilicon will be able to compete successfully against current
and future competitors, or that competitive factors faced by NetSilicon will not
have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon.

     NetSilicon primarily competes with the internal development departments of
large manufacturing companies that have developed their own networking
solutions, as well as established developers of embedded systems software and
chips such as Axis Communications, Echelon, Emulex, Hitachi, Intel, MiLAN
Technology (a division of Digi), Motorola, Peerless Systems, Samsung and Wind
River. In addition, NetSilicon is aware of certain companies which have recently
introduced products that address the markets targeted by NetSilicon. NetSilicon
has experienced and expects to continue to experience increased competition from
current and potential competitors, many of which have substantially greater
financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, as well as greater
name recognition and larger customer bases than NetSilicon. In particular,
established companies in the networking or semiconductor industries may seek to
expand their product offerings by designing and selling products using
competitive technology that could render NetSilicon's products obsolete or have
a material adverse effect on NetSilicon's sales. Increased competition may
result in further price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market
share.

 NETSILICON DEPENDS ON THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE THAT NETSILICON USES UNDER LICENSES
 THAT MAY EXPIRE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, DELAYS OR REDUCTIONS IN
 PRODUCT SHIPMENTS.

     NetSilicon relies on certain software that NetSilicon licenses from third
parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed
software and used in NetSilicon's products to perform key functions. These
software license agreements are with Express Logic, Inc., Allegro Software
Development Corporation and Wind River, each of which terminates only if
NetSilicon defaults under the respective agreement; with Novell, Inc., which is
renewable annually at the option of both parties; with InterNiche Technologies,
Inc., which renews until terminated by either party; and with Peerless Systems
Corporation,

which expires in 2004 and is subject to year-to-year renewals thereafter at the
option of both parties. These third-party software licenses may not continue to
be available to NetSilicon on commercially reasonable terms, and the related
software may not continue to be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced
by the licensors. The loss of licenses to use, or the inability of licensors to
support, maintain, and enhance any of such software, could result in increased
costs, delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software is
developed or licensed, if at all, and integrated.

 NETSILICON DEPENDS ON MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLING AND PRODUCT TESTING
 RELATIONSHIPS AND ON LIMITED SOURCE SUPPLIERS, AND ANY DISRUPTIONS IN THESE
 RELATIONSHIPS MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO NETSILICON'S CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

     NetSilicon does not have its own semiconductor fabrication assembly or
testing operations or contract manufacturing capabilities. Instead, NetSilicon
relies upon independent contractors to manufacture its components,
subassemblies, systems and products. Currently, all of NetSilicon's
semiconductor devices are being manufactured, assembled and tested by Atmel
Corporation in the United States and Europe, and NetSilicon expects that it will
continue to rely upon Atmel, or a similar manufacturer, to manufacture, assemble
and test a significant portion of its semiconductor devices in the future. In
the past, NetSilicon experienced a delay in the introduction of one of its
products due to a problem with Atmel's design tools. While NetSilicon is in the
process of qualifying other suppliers, any qualification and pre-production
periods could be lengthy and may cause delays in providing products to customers
in the event that the sole source supplier of the semiconductor devices fails to
meet NetSilicon's requirements. For example, Atmel uses its manufacturing
facilities for its own products as well as those it manufactures on a contract
basis. There is no assurance that Atmel will have adequate capacity to meet the
needs of its contract manufacturing customers. In addition, semiconductor
manufacturers generally experience periodic constraints on their manufacturing
capacity.

     NetSilicon also relies upon limited-source suppliers for a number of other
components used in its products. There can be no assurance that these
independent contractors and suppliers will be able to meet NetSilicon's future
requirements for manufactured products, components and subassemblies in a timely
fashion. NetSilicon generally purchases limited-source components under purchase
orders and has no guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers. In
addition, the availability of many of these components to NetSilicon is
dependent in part on NetSilicon's ability to provide its suppliers with accurate
forecasts of its future requirements. Any extended interruption in the supply of
any of the key components currently obtained from limited sources would disrupt
NetSilicon's operations and have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon's
business, results of operations and financial condition.

     Delays or lost sales have been and could be caused by other factors beyond
NetSilicon's control, including late deliveries by vendors of components,
changes in implementation priorities or slower than anticipated growth in the
market for networking solutions for embedded systems. Operating results in the
past have also been adversely affected by delays in receipt of significant
purchase orders from customers. In addition, NetSilicon has experienced delays
as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer
specifications. In general, the timing and magnitude of NetSilicon's revenues
are highly dependent upon its achievement of design wins, the timing and success
of its customers' development cycles, and its customers' product sales. Any of
these factors could have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon's business,
results of operations and financial condition.

 THE CYCLICALITY OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL
 PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS.

     NetSilicon's semiconductor products provide networking capabilities for
intelligent, network-enabled devices and other embedded systems. The
semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid technological
change and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times,
characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average
selling prices and production overcapacity. The semiconductor industry also
periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints.
As a result, NetSilicon may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations
in

future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions,
overall economic conditions or other factors.

 NETSILICON'S ABILITY TO COMPETE COULD BE JEOPARDIZED IF NETSILICON IS UNABLE TO
 PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

     NetSilicon's ability to compete depends in part on its proprietary rights
and technology. NetSilicon has one patent and relies primarily on a combination
of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and
contract provisions to protect it proprietary rights.

     NetSilicon generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its
employees, and sometimes with its customers and potential customers and limits
access to the distribution of its software, hardware designs, documentation and
other proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by
NetSilicon in this regard will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of
its technology. NetSilicon's patents may be circumvented by NetSilicon's
competitors, and its current and future patent applications may be denied.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies
that are superior to NetSilicon's. Despite NetSilicon's efforts to protect its
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its
products or to obtain and use information that NetSilicon regards as
proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect
NetSilicon's proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States.
There can be no assurance that NetSilicon's means of protecting its proprietary
rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate or that competing
companies will not independently develop similar technology. NetSilicon's
failure to adequately protect its proprietary rights could have a material
adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

     NetSilicon exclusively licenses the right to use the NET+ARM trademark from
ARM Limited according to a royalty-free agreement expiring in 2008. NetSilicon
depends on ARM to enforce its rights to the trademark against third-party
infringement. There can be no assurance that ARM will promptly and adequately
enforce these rights, which could have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon's
business, results of operations and financial condition.

 NETSILICON COULD BECOME SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AND LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL
 PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM NETSILICON AND REQUIRE NETSILICON
 TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS.

     The semiconductor and networking industries are characterized by frequent
litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Although
NetSilicon has not been notified that its products infringe any third-party
intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that NetSilicon will not
receive such notification in the future. Any litigation to determine the
validity of third-party infringement claims, whether or not determined in
NetSilicon's favor or settled by NetSilicon, would at a minimum be costly and
divert the efforts and attention of NetSilicon's management and technical
personnel from productive tasks, which could have a material adverse effect on
its business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no
assurance that any infringement claims by third parties or any claims for
indemnification by customers or end users of NetSilicon's products resulting
from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such
assertions, if proven to have merit, will not materially adversely affect
NetSilicon's business, results of operations or financial condition. In the
event of an adverse ruling in any such matter, NetSilicon would be required to
pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing
products, discontinue the use of certain processes or be required to obtain a
license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming
infringement. There can be no assurance that a license would be available on
reasonable terms or at all. Any limitations on NetSilicon's ability to market
its products, or delays and costs associated with redesigning its products or
payments of license fees to third parties, or any failure by NetSilicon to
develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms
could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and
financial condition.

 NETSILICON FACES RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND
 EXPANSION THAT COULD IMPAIR ITS ABILITY TO GROW ITS REVENUES ABROAD.

     In the fiscal years ended January 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, international
sales constituted approximately 55%, 50% and 51% of NetSilicon's net sales,
respectively, and approximately 68%, 77% and 46% of NetSilicon's domestic sales
were to customers headquartered in Asia during the fiscal years ended January
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     NetSilicon believes that its future growth is dependent in part upon its
ability to increase sales in international markets, and particularly to
manufacturers located in Japan, which sell their products worldwide. These sales
are subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange
rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes
in regulatory requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and
potentially adverse tax consequences and export license requirements. In
addition, NetSilicon is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business
internationally, including political and economic instability and unexpected
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships. In particular, the economies of
certain countries in the Asia-Pacific region are experiencing considerable
economic instability and downturns. Because NetSilicon's sales to date have been
denominated in United States dollars, increases in the value of the United
States dollar could increase the price in local currencies of NetSilicon's
products in non-US markets and make its products more expensive than
competitors' products denominated in local currencies. In addition, an integral
part of NetSilicon's business strategy is to form strategic alliances for the
manufacture and distribution of its products with third parties, including
foreign corporations. There can be no assurance that one or more of the factors
described above will not have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon's
business, results of operations and financial condition.

     NetSilicon intends to expand its presence in Europe to address new markets.
One change resulting from the formation of a European Economic and Monetary
Union ("EMU") required EMU member states to irrevocably fix their respective
currencies to a new currency, the euro, as of January 1, 1999. Business in the
EMU member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency such
as the French franc or the Deutsche mark, and the euro through 2002. As a
result, companies operating or conducting business in EMU member states will
need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of
processing transactions and properly handling these currencies, including the
euro. There can be no assurance that the conversion to the euro will not have a
material adverse effect on NetSilicon's business, results of operations and
financial condition.

 IF NETSILICON LOSES KEY PERSONNEL IT COULD PREVENT NETSILICON FROM EXECUTING
 ITS BUSINESS STRATEGY.

     NetSilicon's business and prospects depend to a significant degree upon the
continuing contributions of its executive officers and its key technical
personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no
assurance that NetSilicon will be successful in attracting and retaining
qualified personnel. NetSilicon's stock price and the number of options
outstanding with exercise prices in excess of their market price could make it
more difficult to attract and retain key personnel. Failure to attract and
retain key personnel could result in NetSilicon's failure to execute its
business strategy and have a material adverse effect on NetSilicon. NetSilicon
has employment contracts with its Vice President, Intelligent Device Markets
Europe; Vice President, Imaging; Executive Vice President, Finance and
Operations and Chief Financial Officer; and the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. NetSilicon does not maintain any key-man life insurance policies.

  ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SIGNIFICANT REGULATIONS AND EVOLVING INDUSTRY
  STANDARDS COULD DELAY INTRODUCTION OF NETSILICON'S PRODUCTS.

     The market for NetSilicon's products is subject to a significant number of
communications regulations and industry standards, some of which are evolving as
new technologies are deployed. In the United States, its products must comply
with various regulations defined by the Federal Communications Commission and
standards established by Underwriters' Laboratories. Some of NetSilicon's
products may not comply with current industry standards, and this noncompliance
must be addressed in the design of

those products. Standards for networking are still evolving. As the standards
evolve, NetSilicon may be required to modify its products or develop and support
new versions of its products. The failure of NetSilicon's products to comply, or
delays in compliance, with the various existing and evolving industry standards
could delay introduction of its products, which could have a material adverse
effect on NetSilicon's business, results of operations and financial condition.

  ANY MATERIAL PRODUCT DEFECTS COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF MARKET SHARE, DELAY OF
  MARKET ACCEPTANCE OR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS OR LOSSES.

     Complex products such as those offered by NetSilicon may contain undetected
or unresolved defects when first introduced or as new versions are released. The
occurrence of material errors in the future could, and the failure or inability
to correct such errors would, result in the loss of market share, the delay or
loss of market acceptance of NetSilicon's products, material warranty expense,
diversion of engineering and other resources from NetSilicon's product
development efforts, the loss of credibility with its customers or product
recall. The use of NetSilicon's products for applications in devices that
interact directly with the general public, where the failure of the embedded
system could cause property damage or personal injury, could expose NetSilicon
to significant product liability claims. Although NetSilicon has not experienced
any product liability or economic loss claims to date, the sale and support of
its products may entail the risk of such claims. Any of such occurrences could
have a material adverse effect upon NetSilicon's business, results of operations
and financial condition.

  NETSILICON'S FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE ITS GROWTH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
  ADVERSE EFFECT ON NETSILICON.

     NetSilicon has limited internal infrastructure and any significant growth
would place a substantial strain on its financial and management personnel and
information systems and controls. Such growth would require NetSilicon to
implement new and enhance existing financial and management information systems
and controls and add and train personnel to operate such systems effectively.
NetSilicon's intention to continue to pursue its growth strategy through efforts
to increase sales of existing products and new products can be expected to place
even greater pressure on its existing personnel and compound the need for
increased personnel, expanded information systems, and additional financial and
administrative control procedures. There can be no assurance that NetSilicon
will be able to successfully manage expanding operations. NetSilicon's inability
to manage its expanded operations effectively could have a material adverse
effect on NetSilicon's business, results of operations and financial condition.

       NetSilicon's businesses and technologies and the costs associated with
       this integration;

     - government laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign
       operations, including those relating to trade, monetary and fiscal
       policies, and taxes;

     - competitive factors and industry trends, technological advances achieved,
       and patents obtained by competitors and the relevant company's ability to
       respond to those actions; and

     - economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates
       and foreign currency exchange rates and the potential effect of these

                         THE DIGI STOCKHOLDERS MEETING

TIME AND PLACE; MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED

     The enclosed proxy is solicited by the board of directors of Digi for use
at the special meeting of stockholders to be held on           , 200  at 9:00
a.m., Central Time, at           ,           , Minnesota, and at any
adjournments of the meeting. At the Digi special stockholders meeting,
stockholders of Digi will vote on a proposal to approve the issuance of shares
in the merger.

     THE DIGI BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
MERGER AND RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS OF DIGI VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL.

RECORD DATE; QUORUM

     Only holders of record of Digi common stock at the close of business on
          , 200  are entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Digi special
stockholders meeting. As of that date, there were      shares of Digi common
stock entitled to vote, held by      holders of record. Each share of Digi
common stock is entitled to one vote. Holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Digi common stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented
by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Digi
special stockholders meeting.

     We will have a list of Digi stockholders entitled to vote at the Digi
special stockholders meeting available during normal business hours at the
offices of Digi, 11001 Bren Road East, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343, for the
ten-day period before the Digi special stockholders meeting, and also at the
special stockholders meeting.

VOTES REQUIRED

     Stock Issuance.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
total number of shares of Digi common stock present in person or by proxy at the
Digi special stockholders meeting is required to approve the issuance of shares
in the merger.

     On           , 200  , Digi directors and executive officers and persons and
entities affiliated with them owned and were entitled to vote      shares of
Digi common stock. These shares represented less than one percent of the
outstanding shares of Digi common stock on the record date. All of the directors
and executive officers of Digi, have entered into a voting agreement with
NetSilicon in which they have agreed to vote all of their shares of Digi common
stock in favor of the issuance of shares in connection with the merger.

     Votes at the special stockholders meeting will be tabulated by an
independent inspector of election appointed by Digi or by Digi's transfer agent.

HOW PROXIES WILL BE VOTED

     Joseph Dunsmore and Subramanian Krishnan, both of whom are executive
officers of Digi, have been named as proxies in the Digi proxy. Shares
represented by a proxy will be voted at the special stockholders meeting as
specified in the proxy. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting
instructions will be voted "FOR" the approval of the issuance of shares in the
merger. The proxies will be entitled to vote in their discretion on any other
matters that may properly come before the meeting.

TREATMENT OF ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     If you submit a proxy that indicates an abstention from voting, your shares
will be counted as present for purposes of determining the existence of a
quorum, but they will not be voted on the merger proposal.

     Under NASD rules, if you hold your shares in "street name," your bank or
broker cannot vote your shares of Digi common stock without specific
instructions from you. If you do not provide instructions with your proxy, your
bank or broker may deliver a proxy card expressly indicating that it is NOT
voting your

shares; this indication that a bank or broker is not voting your shares is
referred to as a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes will be counted for the
purpose of determining the existence of a quorum, but will not be voted on the
merger proposal.

     Because the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Digi common stock
present in person or represented by proxy is necessary for the approval of the
proposals submitted to Digi stockholders, an abstention or broker non-vote will
have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.

HOW TO REVOKE YOUR PROXY

     Your grant of a proxy on the enclosed proxy card does not prevent you from
voting in person at the special stockholders meeting, which would automatically
revoke your proxy. If your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank, or
other nominee and you wish to vote at the annual stockholders meeting, you will
need to obtain a proxy from the institution that holds your shares.

     In addition, a Digi stockholder may revoke a proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Digi special stockholders meeting by delivering a later-dated
signed proxy or a written notice of revocation to James E. Nicholson, Secretary
of Digi, at the offices of Digi, 11001 Bren Road East, Minnetonka, Minnesota
55343.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Each of Digi and NetSilicon will bear its own cost of soliciting proxies
from its stockholders, except that the cost of printing and mailing this joint
proxy statement/prospectus to Digi and NetSilicon stockholders is being shared
by the companies equally. In addition to solicitation by mail, Digi directors,
officers, and employees may solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone, in
person, or through other means. Digi will not compensate these people for this
solicitation, but we will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
that they have incurred in connection with this solicitation. Digi will also
arrange for brokerage firms, fiduciaries, and other custodians to send
solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by
those persons. Digi will reimburse these brokerage firms, fiduciaries, and other
custodians for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Digi has retained
MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist it in the solicitation of proxies, using the
means referred to above, at an anticipated cost of $5,000, plus reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses.

                      THE NETSILICON STOCKHOLDERS MEETING

TIME AND PLACE; MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED

     The special meeting of NetSilicon, Inc. stockholders will be held on
          , 200 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of NetSilicon, 411
Waverley Oaks Road, Bldg. 227, Waltham, Massachusetts 02452. At the meeting, you
will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, to approve the merger of NetSilicon with and into a
subsidiary of Digi upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger
agreement, and to transact any other and further business as may properly come
before the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the special
meeting, including without limitation, potential adjournments or postponements
for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in order to approve the merger
agreement and merger. If the merger is consummated, NetSilicon will effectively
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Digi.

     NETSILICON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE
MERGER AND RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

RECORD DATE; QUORUM

     Only holders of record of NetSilicon voting common stock at the close of
business on           , 200 are entitled to receive notice of and vote at the
special meeting of NetSilicon stockholders or any adjournments or postponements
of the special meeting. As of that date, there were   shares of NetSilicon
common stock outstanding, of which                are entitled to vote, held by
approximately   holders of record. Each voting share is entitled to one vote.
Holders of at least one-third of the outstanding shares of NetSilicon common
stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, will
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the NetSilicon meeting.

VOTES REQUIRED

     The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of NetSilicon common stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting is required to approve the merger agreement and the merger. If you
abstain or fail to vote your shares on this proposal, it will have the same
effect as voting against the merger.

     On           , 200 , directors and executive officers of NetSilicon owned
and were entitled to vote   shares of NetSilicon common stock. These shares
represented approximately 1.4% of the outstanding voting shares of NetSilicon
common stock on the record date. Each of the directors and executive officers of
NetSilicon who owns NetSilicon shares has agreed to vote for the approval of the
merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, holders of approximately 65.3% of
NetSilicon voting common stock who are not party to a voting agreement must vote
in favor of the merger agreement and the merger in order for stockholder
approval to be obtained.

HOW PROXIES WILL BE VOTED

     Cornelius Peterson, VIII and Daniel J. Sullivan, both of whom have been
named as proxies in the NetSilicon proxy, are directors and/or executive
officers of NetSilicon. Shares represented by a proxy will be voted at the
special meeting as specified in the proxy. Properly executed proxies that do not
contain voting instructions will be voted "FOR" each of the proposals to be
considered at the special meeting.

TREATMENT OF ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     If you submit a proxy that indicates an abstention from voting on any of
the proposals being submitted to stockholders for a vote, your shares will be
counted as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, but
they will not be voted on the proposal or proposals as to which you are

abstaining from voting. An abstention from voting on the merger proposal will
have the same effect as a vote against the merger.

     Under NASD rules, your broker cannot vote your shares of NetSilicon common
stock without specific instructions from you. If you do not provide instructions
with your proxy, your bank or broker may deliver a proxy card expressly
indicating that it is not voting your shares; this indication that a broker is
not voting your shares is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes
will be counted for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum but
will not be voted on the merger proposal. A broker non-vote will therefore have
the same effect as a vote against the merger.

HOW TO REVOKE YOUR PROXY

     A NetSilicon stockholder may revoke a proxy at any time before it is voted
at the NetSilicon special meeting by delivering a written notice of revocation
to the Clerk of NetSilicon at NetSilicon, Inc., 411 Waverley Oaks Road, Bldg.
227, Waltham, Massachusetts 02452, by attending the special meeting and voting
in person. Mere attendance at the special meeting will not in and of itself
revoke a proxy. Stockholders that have instructed a broker to vote their shares
must follow directions received from their broker in order to change their vote,
revoke their proxy or vote at the special meeting. If you are not the registered
direct holder of your shares, you must obtain appropriate documentation from the
registered holder in order to be able to vote the shares in person.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     Each of NetSilicon and Digi will bear the cost of soliciting proxies from
its own stockholders, except that the cost of printing and mailing this joint
proxy statement/prospectus to each company's stockholders is being shared by
NetSilicon and Digi equally. In addition to solicitation by mail, NetSilicon's
directors, officers, and employees may solicit proxies from stockholders by
telephone, in person, or through other means. NetSilicon will not compensate
these people for this solicitation, but NetSilicon will reimburse them for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they have incurred in connection with this
solicitation. NetSilicon will also arrange for brokerage firms, fiduciaries, and
other custodians to send solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of
shares held of record by those persons. NetSilicon will reimburse these
brokerage firms, fiduciaries, and other custodians for their reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. NetSilicon has retained Mackenzie Partners, Inc. to
assist it in the solicitation of proxies, using the means referred to above, at
an anticipated cost of $6,500, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.

                                   THE MERGER

GENERAL

     The merger agreement provides for the merger of NetSilicon with and into
Dove Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Digi. As
a result of the merger, NetSilicon will effectively become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Digi.

     The discussion in this joint proxy statement/prospectus of the merger and
the description of the principal terms of the merger agreement and the merger
are summaries only. You should read the merger agreement in its entirety. A copy
of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Annex A and is incorporated by reference in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

WHAT NETSILICON STOCKHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE IN THE MERGER

     NetSilicon stockholders will receive .65 shares of Digi common stock for
each share of NetSilicon common stock that they hold. There is no minimum or
maximum value imposed on the fraction of a share of Digi common stock to be
issued for each share of NetSilicon common stock in the merger.

     Digi will not issue fractional shares in the merger. As a result, the total
number of shares of Digi common stock that you receive in the merger will be
rounded down to the nearest whole number. You will receive a cash payment for
the value of the remaining fraction of a share of Digi common stock that you
would otherwise have received, based on the average of the trading prices of
Digi common stock on the Nasdaq National Market System over the period of ten
trading days ending on the third trading day before the closing of the merger.

     Instead of stock, each NetSilicon stockholder may elect to receive cash for
some or all of his shares. Detailed instructions regarding making your election
between receiving the merger consideration in stock, in cash, or in a mix of
both are provided on the enclosed election form. If you do not make an election,
you will receive Digi shares in exchange for all of your NetSilicon shares. Also
enclosed are detailed instructions regarding the method of surrendering your
certificates representing shares of NetSilicon common stock for the merger
consideration. Your election may be altered, however, if the elections by all
NetSilicon stockholders would cause Digi to pay more than $15 million in cash in
the merger. If the cash option is over-subscribed, then the cash payable to each
NetSilicon stockholder electing to receive cash will be cut back on a
proportionate basis. NetSilicon stockholders holding shares that are subject to
the cut-back provisions will be entitled to receive the same consideration for
those shares in the merger as if those holders had elected to receive stock in
exchange for those shares. Because Sorrento Networks Corporation, a significant
stockholder of NetSilicon, has agreed to elect the maximum amount of cash to
which it is entitled in the merger, we expect that the cash option will be
over-subscribed, and, therefore, the cut-back provisions will be applicable. The
amount of the per-share cash payments will be determined by multiplying .65
times the average per-share closing price of Digi common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market over the period of ten trading days ending on the third trading
day before closing of the merger.

     After the merger is completed, each record holder who has not previously
surrendered the holder's certificates previously representing shares of
outstanding NetSilicon common stock will be entitled, upon the surrender of the
certificates to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., Digi's stock transfer agent
and the exchange agent for the merger, to receive Digi shares in exchange for
all of the holder's NetSilicon shares. Until surrendered, each certificate
previously representing shares of NetSilicon common stock will be deemed for all
corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the cash
and/or the ownership of the number of whole shares of Digi common stock into
which those shares of NetSilicon capital stock have been converted.

     The stockholders of Digi will continue to hold their shares of common stock
of Digi without any change.

OWNERSHIP OF DIGI AFTER THE MERGER

     Based on the number of outstanding shares of NetSilicon common stock on
          , 200 , and assuming Digi pays a total of $15 million in cash in lieu
of stock to NetSilicon stockholders, the maximum amount of cash payable in the
merger, NetSilicon stockholders will be entitled to receive approximately
          shares of Digi common stock in the merger. Based on that number and on
the number of outstanding shares of Digi common stock on           , 200 , we
anticipate that former NetSilicon stockholders will own approximately 29% of the
outstanding shares of Digi common stock following the merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     NetSilicon and Digi have had a business relationship since July 1998, and
Digi, through its MiLAN division, purchases products from NetSilicon.
Additionally, Digi has previously explored the possibility of using NetSilicon
products in some of Digi's principal products.

     The NetSilicon board of directors from time to time had considered the
desirability of exploring strategic alternatives with potential business
partners. Among the reasons for this were:

     - the relatively small size of NetSilicon;

     - its needs for expansion in certain key business areas, including sales
       and marketing and research and development investment, would be difficult
       for NetSilicon to achieve on a stand-alone basis;

     - uncertainties in certain of its product markets;

     - the instability of the financial markets and the anticipated difficulty
       that NetSilicon would have in raising outside capital; and

     - the elimination or management of the overhang associated with Sorrento
       Networks' ownership position.

     On April 27, 2001, NetSilicon's board of directors authorized the retention
of Thomas Weisel Partners to act as its investment banker and assist management
in identifying and considering strategic transactions involving NetSilicon. On
May 4, 2001, NetSilicon entered into an engagement letter with Thomas Weisel
Partners.

     On May 3, 2001, James Tucker (Digi's Vice President, Business Development)
called Cornelius "Pete" Peterson (NetSilicon's Chief Executive Officer) to
express Digi's interest in acquiring NetSilicon. Mr. Peterson agreed to consider
Mr. Tucker's request for information about NetSilicon. Mr. Peterson also agreed
to meet with Mr. Tucker on May 9, 2001 for further discussions.

     On May 9, 2001, Mr. Peterson met with Mr. Tucker, Joseph Dunsmore (Digi's
Chief Executive Officer) and Subramanian Krishnan (Digi's Chief Financial
Officer) for further strategic discussions about the possibility of a business
combination between the two companies. After the meeting, representatives of
both companies agreed to set up a meeting at NetSilicon's principal offices in
Waltham, Massachusetts in order for the management teams to meet and discuss the
high-level strategic direction of the two companies.

     On May 17, 2001, Digi and NetSilicon entered into a confidentiality
agreement pursuant to which each of them agreed to treat confidentially certain
information provided by the other in connection with determining whether a
transaction between them would be desirable. Digi and NetSilicon thereafter
exchanged confidential information relating to their business and strategic
initiatives.

     On May 21, 2001, members of the Digi management team, Messrs. Dunsmore,
Krishnan and Tucker, as well as Joel Young (Digi's Vice President, Engineering),
met with members of the NetSilicon management team, Mr. Peterson, Daniel
Sullivan (NetSilicon's Chief Financial Officer) and William Peisel (NetSilicon's
Chief Technology Officer). The purpose of the initial meeting was to discuss the
embedded microprocessor market in general, the internal structure of both
organizations and, at a high

level, the strategic direction of both companies. At the meeting,
representatives of both companies considered whether there were any synergies
between the management teams and the companies' respective strategic directions.
Representatives from Thomas Weisel Partners also attended the meeting. The
representatives of both companies agreed to review possible strategic
alternatives and to meet again. Mr. Peterson relayed information concerning the
initial meeting with Digi to members of the NetSilicon board of directors.

     On June 4, 2001, members of the Digi and NetSilicon management teams met
telephonically to continue discussions regarding a possible transaction between
the two companies.

     On June 11, 2001, Digi's board of directors held a telephonic meeting to
discuss a possible transaction with NetSilicon. Digi officers and James E.
Nicholson of Faegre & Benson LLP, Digi's general counsel, were present at the
meeting. Digi's officers summarized NetSilicon's business, as well as the
results of Digi's preliminary due diligence investigation of NetSilicon. Digi's
board of directors, by the unanimous vote of those members in attendance,
authorized management to continue its due diligence investigation of NetSilicon
and discussions relating to a proposed acquisition, with the condition that any
definitive merger agreement negotiated by management would be subject to final
approval by the Digi board of directors at a subsequent meeting.

     On June 12, 2001, Mr. Dunsmore called representatives of Thomas Weisel
Partners and indicated that Digi was interested in pursuing a possible merger
with NetSilicon and made a verbal proposal containing the broad terms of such a
transaction. These broad terms included a stock component of the merger
consideration, in response to the desire of NetSilicon's board of directors and
senior management to receive stock in the merger, as well as a cash component,
in response to the reported desire of Sorrento Networks to receive cash in the
merger.

     On June 18, 2001, Digi's board of directors meet briefly to receive an
update from members of Digi's management on the discussions with NetSilicon. By
the unanimous vote of those members in attendance, the Digi board authorized
management to continue negotiations with NetSilicon.

     On June 19, 2001, Digi and NetSilicon broke off their negotiations. The
closing price of NetSilicon common stock on that date was $5.07.

     In early July 2001, NetSilicon's stock price had fallen to under $4.00 per
share. Because of that, Mr. Dunsmore called Mr. Peterson at NetSilicon and Joe
R. Armstrong, Chief Financial Officer of Sorrento Networks, to determine whether
negotiations should be re-opened. Shortly after these discussions, Digi and
NetSilicon resumed their negotiations.

     On July 16, 2001, Messrs. Peterson, Sullivan and Peisel visited Digi's
headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota to meet with members of Digi's management
team, Messrs. Dunsmore, Krishnan, Young and Tucker as well as Burk Murray
(Digi's Vice President, Marketing), for further discussion on each company's
strategic vision and to provide each management team with further detail on
high-level product direction. At the meeting, representatives of both companies
also explored whether there were management-style and corporate-environment
synergies. Both management teams agreed that further discussions regarding a
possible merger were desirable and agreed to schedule a time for each company to
perform its respective due diligence.

     On July 17, 2001, Mr. Peterson provided Mr. Dunsmore with a preliminary
proposed term sheet for Digi to acquire NetSilicon under the following terms:
each share of NetSilicon common stock outstanding as of the closing date would
be exchanged for a fraction of a Digi share, determined by dividing $7.50 by the
five-day trailing average of Digi stock prices ending one day prior to executing
a definitive agreement. The merger agreement would provide for a cash election
whereby Digi would pay up to $20 million of the purchase price in cash, with the
remaining portion of the purchase price to be paid in Digi common stock. The
closing prices of NetSilicon common stock and Digi common stock on July 17, 2001
were $3.82 and $9.03, respectively.

     On July 18, 2001, Mr. Peterson and Mr. Sullivan met telephonically with the
NetSilicon board of directors to present and discuss the proposal from Digi. The
NetSilicon board authorized senior management to continue negotiations with
Digi. Also on July 18, 2001, the Digi board of directors met and received a
report from Digi management with respect to the status of discussions and due
diligence concerning the NetSilicon acquisition.

     On July 25, 2001, after continued discussions among representatives of
Digi, NetSilicon and Thomas Weisel Partners, Mr. Dunsmore provided
representatives of Thomas Weisel Partners with a revised draft of the
preliminary term sheet for Digi to acquire NetSilicon. The basic terms of the
deal were that each share of NetSilicon common stock outstanding as of the
closing date would be exchanged for fraction of a Digi share, determined by
dividing $5.40 by a Digi stock price of $8.70, resulting in an exchange ratio by
which each share of NetSilicon would be exchanged for .6207 shares of Digi
common stock. The merger agreement would provide for a cash election whereby
Digi would pay up to $20 million of the purchase price in cash, with the
remaining portion of the purchase price to be paid in Digi common stock. The
closing prices of NetSilicon common stock and Digi common stock on July 25, 2001
were $4.00 and $8.80, respectively.

     On July 27, 2001, the NetSilicon board of directors held its quarterly
meeting and discussed the Digi proposal. The NetSilicon board appointed a
subcommittee comprised of Francis E. Girard, William R. Johnson and F. Grant
Saviers to oversee the process. A representative from Thomas Weisel Partners
reviewed the proposal with the board and discussed its financial, business and
market analyses relating to the proposal. The NetSilicon board unanimously voted
to continue discussions with Digi, preliminarily accepted the basic, broad terms
of the proposal and authorized management to begin work on a definitive
agreement.

     Over a period of time from the date of its engagement, representatives of
Thomas Weisel Partners had also made contact with, and had been contacted by,
several other prospective strategic buyers of NetSilicon. No serious continuing
interest arose from those contacts.

     On August 6, 2001, the NetSilicon board subcommittee met telephonically and
authorized Mr. Sullivan to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Digi that
would last for at least 30 days. Digi and NetSilicon entered into the
exclusivity agreement on August 7, 2001.

     On August 8, 2001, Digi entered into an engagement letter with Nesbitt
Burns with an effective date of June 30, 2001, under which Nesbitt Burns would
act as Digi's financial advisor with respect to the proposed merger.

     On August 9, 2001, multiple representatives of Digi and NetSilicon and
their respective legal counsel and investment bankers held a telephonic meeting
to discuss a timetable for closing the proposed merger.

     Between August 7, 2001 and August 13, 2001, the companies exchanged certain
high-level due diligence requests and information.

     From August 13, 2001 through August 16, 2001, the Digi management team and
Nesbitt Burns visited NetSilicon's Waltham, Massachusetts offices in order to
perform further due diligence on NetSilicon. Representatives of Thomas Weisel
Partners were also present at these meetings. The meetings ended satisfactorily
and both management teams agreed to continue with merger discussions.

     Between August 15, 2001 and the next scheduled joint management team
meeting on August 27, 2001, the companies exchanged additional information as
part of the ongoing due diligence process and continued work on a definitive
agreement. Additionally, each company made due diligence calls to the other
company's respective customers.

     On August 17, 2001, counsel for Digi provided counsel for NetSilicon a
first draft of a proposed form of merger agreement. The merger consideration was
proposed to be payable in cash, stock or a combination of both, provided that
the maximum cash payable by Digi would not exceed $20 million. NetSilicon
stockholders would receive an amount in cash equal to a floating exchange ratio
times the average per-share closing price of Digi common stock during a defined
period ending shortly before the closing. The stock component of the merger
consideration was to consist of a number of shares of Digi

common stock equal to the floating exchange ratio. In either case, the floating
exchange ratio would be adjusted upward or downward depending on the average per
share closing price of Digi common stock, but would not exceed .6908 (if the
average Digi common stock closing price was less than $7.60) or fall below .5928
(if the average Digi common stock closing price was greater than $9.70). The
termination fee proposed was $3.25 million.

     The draft merger agreement was also accompanied by a draft stockholder
agreement between Digi and NetSilicon's largest stockholder, Sorrento Networks
Corporation. This draft stockholder agreement, among other things, granted Digi
an option to purchase all of Sorrento's shares if the merger agreement were
terminated under certain conditions.

     The companies thereafter engaged in additional due diligence exchanges,
which included interviews of persons responsible for the financial affairs of
Digi and NetSilicon, respectively, as well as due diligence regarding strategic,
management, legal and business issues.

     On August 21, 2001, a proposed form of merger agreement and related
ancillary agreements were forwarded to the NetSilicon board of directors for
review and consideration.

     On August 27 and August 28, 2001, Messrs. Sullivan and Peisel and
representatives of Thomas Weisel Partners visited Digi's offices in Minnetonka,
Minnesota for further due diligence by NetSilicon on Digi's financial,
engineering, sales and marketing strategies. Representatives of Nesbitt Burns
were also present at these meetings.

     On August 27, 2001, the NetSilicon board of directors met telephonically
and expressed some concern that there was no downside protection to the amount
of Digi stock to be offered in the merger and no right for NetSilicon to
terminate the agreement if Digi's stock price decreased significantly before
completion of the merger. Representatives from Thomas Weisel Partners discussed
with the NetSilicon board the possibility of including in the merger agreement a
price-protection provision to ensure that the value of the merger would remain
the same in the event of fluctuations within defined parameters in the price of
Digi stock, commonly known as a collar provision. In addition, the NetSilicon
board expressed a desire to remove the option contained in the stockholder
agreement with Sorrento Networks. After lengthy discussion, the NetSilicon board
authorized senior management to move forward with the term sheet and merger as
proposed by Digi, with instructions to attempt to resolve the issues relating to
downside protection and the Sorrento Networks option.

     On August 30, 2001, the companies extended their exclusivity agreement
through at least September 14, 2001.

     On August 31, 2001, the board of directors of Digi held a special
telephonic meeting to consider the results of Digi's due diligence investigation
of NetSilicon and to consider the terms and conditions of the proposed merger
negotiated by Digi management. Digi officers, Faegre & Benson, and
representatives of Nesbitt Burns participated in the meeting. Digi's officers
discussed with the board Digi's and NetSilicon's separate and pro forma combined
financial and business information, the strategic rationale for a combination of
the two companies, and the results of Digi's due diligence investigation of
NetSilicon. Faegre & Benson discussed with the board the proposed terms of the
merger agreement and the Sorrento Networks agreement and the board's fiduciary
duties in considering approval of the proposed merger. At this meeting, Nesbitt
Burns presented a summary of its financial analysis relating to the proposed
merger and indicated to the board that it expected to be able to issue an
opinion that, based upon and subject to the matters described in the opinion,
the consideration to be issued in the merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to Digi. Faegre & Benson also discussed the status of various pending
lawsuits against NetSilicon in connection with its initial public offering.
After deliberations, subject to receipt of a written fairness opinion from
Nesbitt Burns and a cap on the exchange ratio and the cash component of the
merger consideration, the Digi board of directors unanimously approved the
proposed merger, declared it to be advisable and in the best interest of Digi's
stockholders, and resolved to recommend that Digi's stockholders vote in favor
of the issuance of Digi common stock in the merger.

     From September 3, 2001 through September 7, 2001, the parties continued to
interview each other's customers and conduct extensive due diligence.

     Both management teams agreed to work on the definitive agreement in order
to close and announce the deal on or about on September 11, 2001. Due to the
tragic events of September 11, 2001, both management teams agreed to slow the
merger discussions until each team could assess the impact of those events on
their respective businesses.

     On September 19, 2001, the companies extended their exclusivity agreement
through at least October 1, 2001. After October 1, 2001, NetSilicon had the
option to terminate the exclusivity agreement but did not elect to do so.

     On September 28, 2001, Digi's board of directors held a regular telephonic
meeting. Digi management reported on the status of negotiations and due
diligence with respect to NetSilicon and reported on general industry conditions
after the tragic events of September 11.

     On October 18, 2001, management of both companies attended a full-day video
conference and determined to move forward with a transaction using a fixed
exchange ratio. The parties agreed to recommend to their respective boards that
each share of NetSilicon common stock would be exchanged for .65 shares of Digi
common stock, cash in the amount of .65 multiplied by the average per-share
closing price of Digi common stock during the ten trading days ending on the
third trading day before the date of closing, or a combination of both stock and
cash. The merger agreement would provide for a cash election whereby Digi would
pay up to $15 million of the purchase price in cash, with the remaining portion
of the purchase price to be paid in Digi common stock. The closing prices of
NetSilicon common stock and Digi common stock on October 18, 2001 were $2.42 and
$5.09, respectively. The parties also agreed to eliminate the Sorrento Networks
option from the stockholder agreement and, following discussion of Digi's
proposal to set the termination fee at $3.25 million, decided on a termination
fee of $2.5 million. Finally, Digi agreed to revise the merger agreement so that
in certain circumstances the termination fee would be payable only upon
consummation of a third-party acquisition, rather than upon the signing of an
agreement.

     By a unanimous written action dated October 18, 2001, Digi's board of
directors approved the final pricing terms of the transaction, with a fixed
exchange ratio of .65 shares of Digi common stock for each share of NetSilicon
common stock and a $15 million limit on the cash component of the merger
consideration.

     The NetSilicon board of directors met on October 24, 2001 to review the
progress of negotiations and the proposed terms of the merger. Messrs. Peterson
and Sullivan gave oral and written presentations to the NetSilicon board and
representatives of Thomas Weisel Partners updated and supplemented the financial
and other information and analyses they had provided to the NetSilicon board at
earlier meetings. Legal advisors for NetSilicon reviewed with the NetSilicon
board the results of their due diligence review and the terms of the proposed
transaction. Legal counsel also reviewed with the board its fiduciary duties
with respect to the transaction. At the meeting, the NetSilicon board received
Thomas Weisel Partners' verbal opinion that, as of that date and subject to the
matters described in the opinion, the consideration to be received by
NetSilicon's stockholders in the merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the stockholders. Following lengthy discussions, including a
recommendation by the board subcommittee, the NetSilicon board approved the
merger, the merger agreement and certain ancillary agreements, resolved to
recommend that NetSilicon's stockholders approve the merger, and authorized
senior management to proceed with the transaction. The closing price of
NetSilicon common stock and Digi common stock on October 24, 2001 was $2.98 and
$5.95, respectively. Thomas Weisel Partners subsequently restated its oral
opinion, as of October 29, 2001, and also delivered to the board of directors of
NetSilicon its written opinion, dated October 29, 2001, confirming its oral
opinion.

     The NetSilicon board of directors also authorized an amendment to the
NetSilicon rights agreement, exempting the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement from the rights agreement.

     On October 24, 2001, Nesbitt Burns delivered to members of Digi's board of
directors its updated analysis with respect to the NetSilicon acquisition,
supplementing and updating information previously delivered to the board of
directors in connection with its presentation at the August 31 board meeting. On
October 30, 2001, Nesbitt Burns delivered its written opinion to Digi's board of
directors that, as of that date and subject to the matters discussed in the
opinion, the consideration to be paid by Digi under the merger agreement was
fair to Digi from a financial point of view.

     The parties executed the merger agreement and various related agreements,
including voting agreements whereby certain directors and executive officers of
each company agreed to vote all of their shares of stock in favor of the merger,
on October 30, 2001. The transaction was announced through a joint press release
following the close of the market on the same day.

DIGI'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF THE DIGI BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Digi board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of
Digi vote "FOR" the issuance of Digi common stock in the merger.

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger,
the Digi board of directors consulted with:

     - its legal counsel regarding the legal terms of the transaction;

     - its financial advisors regarding the financial aspects of the proposed
       transaction and the fairness of the merger consideration, including the
       exchange ratio, to Digi from a financial point of view; and

     - the management of Digi.

     Among the information and factors that the Digi board of directors
considered in its deliberations were the following:

     - management's expectation that, although immediately dilutive, the merger
       will be accretive to Digi's earnings per share in later years;

     - the overall strategic fit between Digi and NetSilicon in view of their
       respective product lines and markets;

     - that the complementary nature of the two companies' device connectivity
       products will give the combined company an expanded range of products and
       technology;

     - that NetSilicon's position as an early entrant in the small but growing
       embedded systems market will allow Digi to further reposition its
       business to address growth markets in device connectivity;

     - the expected enhancement of Digi's research and development capability
       and an economical and efficient means to expand Digi's device
       connectivity business;

     - access to NetSilicon's proprietary embedded device expertise and
       capability and other proprietary technologies;

     - that Digi's strong balance sheet and net cash position should enable the
       combined company to pursue development and marketing of NetSilicon's
       embedded device server products;

     - the maximum cash component of the merger consideration and aggregate
       number of Digi shares to be delivered to NetSilicon stockholders in
       connection with the merger; and

     - that the increased float of Digi common stock resulting from the merger
       should afford stockholders of the combined company an opportunity to
       benefit from some greater trading liquidity and may, with the greater
       size and scale of the combined company, potentially increase research
       coverage.

     In its deliberations, the Digi board carefully considered the following
additional factors and information:

     - the financial analyses and presentations that Digi management and Nesbitt
       Burns made at the August 31, 2001 meeting of the Digi board of directors;

     - the statement of representatives of Nesbitt Burns, at the August 31, 2001
       meeting of the Digi board of directors, that Nesbitt Burns expected to be
       able to issue its opinion that the consideration offered in the merger
       was fair, from a financial point of view, to Digi (Nesbitt Burns
       subsequently delivered its written opinion, dated October 30, 2001, to
       the effect that, as of that date, and subject to the assumptions,
       qualifications, and limitations expressed in that opinion, the
       consideration to be paid in the merger was fair, from a financial point
       of view, to Digi);

     - information concerning the business, earnings, operations, financial
       condition, and prospects of Digi and NetSilicon, both individually and on
       a combined basis, including information with respect to the past earnings
       performance of each of Digi and NetSilicon;

     - reports from management and legal advisors as to the results of their due
       diligence investigation of NetSilicon;

     - the belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties'
       representations, warranties, and covenants, and the conditions to the
       parties' respective obligations, are not unusual; and

     - the termination fee and expense reimbursement payable by NetSilicon under
       some circumstances.

     The board of directors of Digi also considered a variety of risks and other
potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger. In
particular, the board of directors of Digi considered:

     - the risks associated with integrating the operations of NetSilicon with
       Digi's existing operations;

     - the risk of diverting management focus and resources from other strategic
       opportunities and from operational matters while working to implement the
       merger;

     - the possible effect of the public announcement of the merger on the
       market price of Digi common stock in the short term; and

     - competition from new and existing technologies.

     The board of directors of Digi concluded that the anticipated benefits of
the merger outweighed the possible detriments.

     The foregoing discussion of factors considered by the Digi board of
directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material
information and factors considered by the Digi board of directors in its
consideration of the merger. There can be no assurance that the strategic goals
of the merger will be achieved. See "Risk Factors."

     In view of the wide variety of factors considered, the Digi board of
directors did not find it practicable to quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered in its deliberations and made its
determination after consideration of all of the factors as a whole. In addition,
individual members of the Digi board of directors may have given different
weights to different factors. After taking into account all of the factors set
forth above, the Digi board of directors unanimously agreed that the merger is
advisable and in the best interests of Digi and its stockholders.

NETSILICON'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER; RECOMMENDATION OF NETSILICON'S BOARD OF
DIRECTORS

     The NetSilicon board of directors has determined that the terms of the
merger agreement and the merger are fair to, and in the best interests of,
NetSilicon and its stockholders. Accordingly, the NetSilicon board of directors
has approved the merger agreement and recommends that stockholders of NetSilicon
vote for approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, including the merger.

     In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger,
the NetSilicon board of directors consulted with:

     - its legal counsel regarding the legal terms of the transaction and the
       obligations and duties of the NetSilicon board of directors in its
       consideration of the proposed transaction;

     - its financial advisors regarding the financial aspects of the proposed
       transaction and the fairness of the merger consideration, including the
       exchange ratio, to NetSilicon's stockholders from a financial point of
       view; and

     - the management of NetSilicon.

     Among the information and factors that the NetSilicon board of directors
considered in its deliberations were the following:

     - Historical information concerning NetSilicon's and Digi's respective
       businesses, prospects, financial performance and condition, operations,
       technology, management, and competitive position, including public
       reports concerning results of operations during the most recent fiscal
       year and fiscal quarter for each company filed with the Securities and
       Exchange Commission.

     - The financial condition, results of operations, and businesses of
       NetSilicon and Digi before and after giving effect to the merger.

     - The near- and long-term prospects of NetSilicon as an independent company
       and of the combined company.

     - That NetSilicon's stockholders will have the opportunity to participate
       in the potential for the greater growth, operational efficiencies,
       financial strength, and earning power of the combined company after the
       merger.

     - The advantages that might be expected to accrue to the combined company
       in terms of the creation of a larger customer base, a higher market
       profile, greater financial strength, and broader customer offerings,
       which could enhance the ability of the combined company to compete in the
       marketplace.

     - Current financial market conditions, historical market prices,
       volatility, and trading information with respect to NetSilicon common
       stock and Digi common stock and historical price/earnings ratios of
       NetSilicon and Digi.

     - The consideration to be received by NetSilicon's stockholders in the
       merger and the relationship between the market value of Digi common stock
       to be issued in exchange for shares of NetSilicon common stock and the
       market value of NetSilicon common stock.

     - The market price of NetSilicon common stock and the potential for
       NetSilicon stockholders to receive a premium over the closing price of
       NetSilicon common stock on October 30, 2001, the last trading day before
       the public announcement of the merger. If, on the date the merger is
       completed, the closing price for shares of Digi common stock is the same
       as it was on October 30, 2001, NetSilicon stockholders will receive a
       premium of approximately 35.8% over the closing price of NetSilicon
       common stock on that date.

     - The cash component of the merger consideration, which provides some
       liquidity to NetSilicon stockholders.

     - Data involving a comparison of comparable merger transactions.

     - The belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including the parties'
       representations, warranties, and covenants, and the conditions to their
       respective obligations, are reasonable.

     - The strategic fit and compatibility of the two companies and the
       expectation that the merger would result in certain synergies that, if
       achieved, might improve the results of Digi.

     - The fact that representatives of Thomas Weisel Partners, on behalf of
       NetSilicon, had solicited interest in a possible acquisition of
       NetSilicon from third parties that NetSilicon and representatives of
       Thomas Weisel Partners believed were likely to have an interest in a
       potential transaction and that NetSilicon had not received any offers
       from other parties at prices in excess of the consideration to be
       received in the merger.

     - The ability of the NetSilicon board of directors, under the merger
       agreement, to respond to unsolicited requests for nonpublic information,
       to participate in discussions and negotiations with unsolicited potential
       third-party acquirors under certain circumstances, and to terminate the
       merger agreement under certain circumstances in order to accept
       third-party offers, subject to the payment of a termination fee.

     - Detailed financial analysis and other information with respect to the
       companies presented by representatives of Thomas Weisel Partners to the
       NetSilicon board of directors, including its opinion that, as of the date
       of the opinion and subject to the matters discussed in the opinion, the
       merger consideration in the merger is fair to the stockholders of
       NetSilicon from a financial point of view.

     - The impact of the merger on NetSilicon's customers and employees.

     - Reports from management and legal, accounting, and financial advisors as
       to the results of their due diligence investigation of Digi.

     - The parties' intent to treat the merger as a tax-free reorganization
       under the Internal Revenue Code.

     - The fact that Massachusetts law entitles NetSilicon stockholders who do
       not vote in favor of the merger and who file a written objection with
       NetSilicon to obtain the "fair value" of their shares, as determined by a
       court, if the merger is completed.

     The NetSilicon board of directors also considered potentially negative
factors relating to the merger, including:

     - The risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
       fully realized.

     - The possibility that the merger might not be consummated and the effect
       of a public announcement of the merger or any failure to consummate the
       merger on:

      - NetSilicon's sales, operating results and stock price; and

      - NetSilicon's ability to attract and retain customers, suppliers, key
        management, and sales and marketing and technical personnel.

     - That the termination fee of $2.5 million and $750,000 expense
       reimbursement required to be paid by NetSilicon under the merger
       agreement under certain circumstances might discourage a third party from
       seeking to acquire NetSilicon.

     - The substantial charges to be incurred in connection with the merger,
       including costs of integrating the businesses and transaction expenses
       arising from the merger.

     - The risk that despite the efforts of the combined company, key technical,
       sales, and management personnel might not remain employed by the combined
       company.

     - Risks associated with fluctuations in Digi's common stock price.

     - The fact that certain stockholders might prefer an all-cash transaction
       to a transaction in which a substantial portion of the merger
       consideration would be stock.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
NetSilicon board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed
to include all material factors considered by the

NetSilicon board of directors. There can be no assurance that the strategic
goals of the merger will be achieved. See "Risk Factors" on page   of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus.

     In view of the wide variety of information and factors, both positive and
negative, considered by the NetSilicon board of directors, the NetSilicon board
of directors did not find it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise
assign relative or specific weights to the foregoing factors considered. After
taking into consideration all of the above factors, the NetSilicon board of
directors determined that the merger agreement and the merger were in the best
interests of NetSilicon and its stockholders and that NetSilicon should enter
into the merger agreement and complete the merger.

     In considering the recommendation of the NetSilicon board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware that certain
directors and officers of NetSilicon have certain interests in the merger that
are different from, and in addition to, the interests of NetSilicon stockholders
generally. These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled
"-- Interests of Directors and Executive Officers of NetSilicon in the Merger"
on page   of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO DIGI

     On October 30, 2001, Nesbitt Burns delivered its written opinion to Digi's
board of directors that, as of such date and subject to the matters discussed in
the opinion, the consideration to be paid by Digi pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair to Digi from a financial point of view.

     The full text of the written opinion of Nesbitt Burns, dated October 30,
2001, which sets forth assumptions made, matters considered, and limitations on
the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex E and
is incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You
should read the opinion in its entirety. The opinion expressed by Nesbitt Burns
was provided for the information and assistance of the board of directors of
Digi in connection with its consideration of the transaction contemplated by the
merger agreement, and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to
any action the board of directors of Digi or any stockholder of Digi should take
in connection with the merger or any aspect thereof and is not a recommendation
to any person on how such person should vote with respect to the merger.

     In connection with its opinion, Nesbitt Burns reviewed, among other things:

     - a draft of the merger agreement dated October 23, 2001;

     - annual reports to stockholders of NetSilicon for the years ended January
       31, 2000 and 2001;

     - annual reports on Form 10-K of NetSilicon for the years ended January 31,
       2000 and 2001;

     - certain quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of NetSilicon;

     - annual reports to stockholders of Digi for the years ended September 30,
       1999 and 2000;

     - annual reports on Form 10-K of Digi for the years ended September 30,
       1999 and 2000;

     - certain quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of Digi;

     - certain other communications from NetSilicon and Digi to their respective
       stockholders;

     - certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for NetSilicon prepared
       by its management and Digi's management;

     - certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Digi prepared by
       its management; and

     - independent third-party research and estimates.

     Nesbitt Burns also held discussions with members of the management of Digi
and NetSilicon regarding the past and current business operations, financial
condition and future prospects of their respective companies.

     In addition, Nesbitt Burns:

     - reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the common stock of
       NetSilicon and Digi;

     - compared certain financial and stock market information for NetSilicon
       and Digi with similar information for certain other companies, the
       securities of which are publicly traded;

     - reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in
       NetSilicon's and Digi's industries specifically and in other industries
       generally; and

     - performed such other studies and analyses as Nesbitt Burns considered
       appropriate.

     Nesbitt Burns assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all
information supplied or otherwise made available to it by Digi and NetSilicon or
obtained from other sources, and upon the assurance of Digi's management that
they were not aware of any information or facts that would make the information
provided to Nesbitt Burns incomplete or misleading. Nesbitt Burns did not
independently verify such information, undertake an independent appraisal of the
assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Digi or NetSilicon, or
receive any such appraisals. With respect to financial forecasts for NetSilicon
and Digi, Nesbitt Burns has been advised by Digi, and has assumed, without
independent investigation, that they have been reasonably prepared and reflect
the best currently available estimates and judgment of management as to the
expected future financial performance of NetSilicon and Digi.

     The opinion of Nesbitt Burns does not address the relative merits of the
transaction contemplated pursuant to the merger agreement as compared to any
alternative business transaction that might be available to Digi. The opinion
expressed by Nesbitt Burns was provided for the information and assistance of
the board of directors of Digi in connection with its consideration of the
merger, and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to any action
the board of directors of Digi or any stockholder of Digi should take in
connection with the merger or any aspect thereof and is not a recommendation to
any person on how such person should vote with respect to the merger. Although
Nesbitt Burns evaluated the merger consideration from a financial point of view,
Nesbitt Burns was not asked to and did not recommend the specific consideration
payable in the merger, which was determined through negotiations between Digi
and NetSilicon. Nesbitt Burns' opinion relates solely to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the merger consideration to Digi. Nesbitt Burns has
expressed no opinion as to the structure, terms or effect of any other aspect of
the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

     The following is a summary of certain financial analyses used by Nesbitt
Burns in connection with providing its opinion to Digi's board of directors
dated October 30, 2001.

     THE FOLLOWING SUMMARIES OF FINANCIAL ANALYSES INCLUDE INFORMATION PRESENTED
IN TABULAR FORMAT. YOU SHOULD READ THESE TABLES TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH
SUMMARY.

     Closing Price and Exchange Ratio Analysis.  Nesbitt Burns calculated the
merger price ($3.54 based on the exchange ratio of .65 as set forth in the
merger agreement and the average closing price of Digi for the 10-trading day
period ending October 29, 2001). Although the merger price is subject to change
based upon fluctuations in the price of Digi common stock, Nesbitt Burns used a
per-share merger price of $3.54 for purposes of its financial analyses.

     Nesbitt Burns reviewed the average closing price of NetSilicon common stock
over various periods ending on October 29, 2001. These average prices are
referred to as the "period average closing prices." Nesbitt Burns compared the
merger price to the period average closing prices.

     Nesbitt Burns also reviewed the average of the ratio of the closing price
of NetSilicon common stock divided by the closing price of Digi common stock
over various selected periods ending on October 29, 2001. These ratios are
referred to as the "period average exchange ratios." Nesbitt Burns examined the
premiums represented by the exchange ratio (.65) set forth in the merger
agreement over the period average exchange ratios.

     This analysis indicated the following:

                                                                             PREMIUM OF

     Selected Premiums Paid Analysis.  Nesbitt Burns reviewed 142 selected
stock-for-stock transactions involving technology companies effected since
January 1, 2000. Thirty transactions within this selected set involved publicly
traded target companies. Nesbitt Burns reviewed the purchase prices and implied
premiums paid in these 30 transactions, as reported by Thomson Financial
Securities Data Corporation. For these 30 selected precedent transactions,
Nesbitt Burns calculated the mean and median implied premiums paid. Nesbitt
Burns then compared the mean and median implied premiums paid in the selected
transactions with the premium implied in the merger based on the merger price.

     For each selected transaction or group of transactions, the following table
presents the premiums implied in each transaction based on the final price paid
and the stock prices for the targets at various points in time prior to the
public announcement of the transaction.

(1) Premiums reported by Thomson Financial Securities Data Corporation.

(2) NetSilicon closing price on 10/29/01.

(3) Assumes per-share merger price of $3.54, based upon the average closing
    price of Digi common stock for the period of 10 trading days ending October
    29, 2001.

     Nesbitt Burns applied these premiums to the corresponding NetSilicon stock
prices as of October 29, 2001 to derive an implied equity reference range for
NetSilicon of approximately $2.40 to $4.42 per share.

     Selected Comparable Company Analysis.  Nesbitt Burns reviewed and compared
selected financial information, ratios and public market multiples for
NetSilicon to corresponding financial information, ratios and public market
multiples for the following selected publicly traded companies (collectively,
the "comparable companies"):

     - Broadcom Corporation (BRCM)

     - Centillium Communications, Inc. (CTLM)

     - Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS)

     - Conexant Systems, Inc. (CNXT)

     - Echelon Corporation (ELON)

     - Lantronix, Inc. (LTRX)

     - Transwitch Corporation (TXCC)

     - Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation (VTSS)

     - Wind River Systems, Inc. (WIND)

     The selected companies were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies that, for purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to
NetSilicon. Nesbitt Burns calculated and compared various financial multiples
and ratios. The multiples and ratios were calculated using the closing price for
each of the selected companies on October 29, 2001 and the merger price for
NetSilicon. Earnings estimates utilized for the selected comparable companies
were based on estimates obtained from I/B/E/S International, Inc. ("IBES"), a
provider of financial information, as of October 29, 2001. Revenue and earnings
estimates utilized for NetSilicon were based on estimates obtained from Digi
management. Certain other estimates were obtained from published stock analyst
reports.

     Nesbitt Burns' analysis of the selected comparable companies compared the
following to the results or estimates for NetSilicon:

     - Closing price as a multiple of forecasted next fiscal year ("NFY") + 1
       earnings per share ("EPS"); and

     - Enterprise value (calculated as equity market value plus debt, less cash)
       as a multiple of latest twelve month ("LTM") and estimated current fiscal
       year ("CFY") and next fiscal year revenue.

     The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

     Nesbitt Burns applied a range of selected multiples derived from the
selected companies to corresponding financial data of NetSilicon in order to
derive an implied equity reference range for NetSilicon of approximately $8.16
to $10.72 per share.

     Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.  Nesbitt Burns analyzed certain
information relating to 10 selected proposed, pending or completed transactions
(the "selected transactions") that were considered to be in the same or similar
lines of business as NetSilicon, from January 1, 2001 to present. Nesbitt Burns
calculated various financial multiples and premiums over market value based on
publicly available information for each of the selected transactions. Financial
estimates utilized for NetSilicon were based on estimates obtained from Digi
management. Earnings estimates utilized for the selected transactions were based
on estimates obtained from IBES, as of the time each respective transaction was
announced. Certain

other estimates were obtained from published stock analyst reports at the time
each respective transaction was announced.

     Nesbitt Burns' analysis of the selected transactions compared the following
to the results or estimates for NetSilicon:

     - Closing price as a multiple of forecasted NFY + 1 EPS; and

     - Enterprise value as a multiple of LTM and estimated CFY and NFY revenue.

     The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

(1) Multiples that do not provide a meaningful comparison and companies with
    negative earnings have been excluded from the range and mean and median
    calculations.

(2) Assumes merger price of $3.54 per share based on the average closing price

(3) Price for NFY+1 earnings is based on present value of the merger price
    discounted back one year at discount rates ranging from 17% to 21% to make

     Nesbitt Burns applied a range of selected multiples derived from the
selected transactions to corresponding financial data of NetSilicon in order to
derive an implied equity reference range for NetSilicon of approximately $7.07
to $8.43 per share.

     Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.  Using a discounted cash flow analysis,
Nesbitt Burns calculated the present value of the estimated unlevered free cash
flows of NetSilicon for the fiscal years 2002 to 2006 and a residual value at
2006, based upon estimates prepared by the management of Digi. Nesbitt Burns
determined certain equity value reference ranges for NetSilicon based upon the
sum of: (i) the discounted value (using discount rates ranging from 17.0% to
21.0%) of the estimated unlevered free cash flows of NetSilicon, plus (ii) the
discounted value (using various discount rates from 17.0% to 21.0%) of the
product of (a) estimated revenue for NetSilicon for fiscal year 2006 and (b)
various residual value multiples (ranging from 1.75x to 2.50x), less (iii) total
debt net of cash and short-term investments.

     This analysis resulted in an implied equity value reference range per share
of NetSilicon common stock of $4.63 to $6.91.

     Contribution Analysis.  Nesbitt Burns computed the following:

     - The relative contributions of Digi and NetSilicon to the estimated
       revenue and gross profit of the combined company for Digi's fiscal years
       ended on or about September 2001 through 2003, based on management
       forecasts provided by Digi.

     - The relative current market capitalization of Digi and NetSilicon to the
       sum of the two companies' combined market capitalizations, as of October
       29, 2001.

     Nesbitt Burns then computed, assuming an all-stock transaction, the fully
diluted ownership of NetSilicon stockholders in the combined company implied by
NetSilicon's relative contribution as well as the resulting implied exchange
ratio.

     Based on this analysis, Nesbitt Burns observed the following:

                                          IMPLIED NETSILICON STOCKHOLDERS
                                              FULLY DILUTED OWNERSHIP       IMPLIED ZERO PREMIUM

Equity Market
  Capitalization -- Diluted.............               28.5%                       0.4353

     Nesbitt Burns noted that the estimated pro forma fully diluted ownership,
assuming an all-stock transaction, of NetSilicon stockholders in the combined
company implied by the exchange ratio in the merger was 37.3% and that the
exchange ratio was .65.

     Pro Forma Earnings Analysis.  Nesbitt Burns analyzed the potential pro
forma effect of the merger on Digi's estimated earnings per share for Digi's
fiscal years ending September 30, 2002 and 2003, taking into consideration
various financial effects which will result from consummation of the merger.
This analysis relies upon financial and operating assumptions provided by Digi
management and publicly available data about NetSilicon and Digi.

     Nesbitt Burns noted that, without giving effect to any potential cost
savings and other synergies identified by the management of Digi, the
transaction would have the following impact on Digi's estimated EPS:

    Fiscal year 2002 estimated EPS accretion/(dilution) (171.2)%

    Fiscal year 2003 estimated EPS accretion/(dilution) 41.9%

     The actual results achieved by the combined companies may vary from
projected results, and such variations may be material.

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Nesbitt Burns' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Nesbitt Burns considered the results of all such analyses. No company or
transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to
NetSilicon, Digi or the contemplated transaction.

     The analyses were prepared solely for purposes of providing an opinion to
Digi's board of directors as to the fairness from a financial point of view to
Digi of the merger consideration as of October 30, 2001.

     The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based
upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty,
being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or
their respective advisors, none of Digi, Nesbitt Burns or any other person
assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those
forecast.

     As described above, Nesbitt Burns' opinion to Digi's board of directors was
one of many factors taken into consideration by Digi's board of directors in
making its determination to approve the merger. The foregoing summary does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Nesbitt Burns.

     Nesbitt Burns' opinion was necessarily based upon financial, economic,
market and other conditions as they existed, and the information made available
to Nesbitt Burns, as of the date of the opinion. Nesbitt Burns disclaimed any
undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or
matter affecting the opinion which may come or be brought to Nesbitt Burns'
attention after the date of the opinion.

     Nesbitt Burns, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Nesbitt Burns may have
in the past provided certain investment banking services to Digi, and certain of
its affiliates may have provided corporate banking services to Digi and
NetSilicon from time to time for which they have received or will receive
customary fees. Nesbitt Burns and certain of its affiliates may provide
investment and corporate banking services to Digi and its affiliates in the
future. Nesbitt Burns provides a full range of financial advisory and securities
services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may from time to
time effect transactions and hold securities, including derivative securities,
of Digi or NetSilicon for its own account and for the accounts of customers.

     Pursuant to a letter agreement effective as of June 30, 2001, Digi engaged
Nesbitt Burns to act as its financial advisor in connection with the possible
acquisition of, or merger with, NetSilicon. Pursuant to the terms of the letter
agreement, upon the consummation of the merger, Nesbitt Burns will be entitled
to receive a fee of $575,000 from Digi in connection with the merger (a portion
of which has been previously earned in connection with the engagement of Nesbitt
Burns as financial advisor). Digi also has agreed to reimburse Nesbitt Burns for
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including counsel fees, and to indemnify
Nesbitt Burns against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under
the federal securities laws.

OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO NETSILICON

     Thomas Weisel Partners LLC has acted as financial advisor to NetSilicon in
connection with the merger. On October 24, 2001, Thomas Weisel Partners
delivered to the board of directors of NetSilicon its oral opinion that, as of
that date, the consideration to be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon
was fair to such stockholders from a financial point of view. Thomas Weisel
Partners subsequently restated its oral opinion, as of October 29, 2001, and
also delivered to the board of directors of NetSilicon its written opinion,
dated October 29, 2001, confirming its oral opinion. NetSilicon did not impose

made or procedures followed in rendering its opinion.

     The full text of the Thomas Weisel Partners opinion is attached as Annex F
to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Stockholders of NetSilicon are urged
to, and should, read this opinion carefully and in its entirety. We have,
however, included the following summary of the Thomas Weisel Partners opinion.

     Thomas Weisel Partners directed its opinion to the board of directors of
NetSilicon. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to you as to how
you should vote with respect to the transaction. The opinion addresses only the
fairness of the consideration to be received by stockholders of NetSilicon from

or any alternatives to the merger. Further, it does not address NetSilicon's
underlying decision to proceed with or effect the merger. In furnishing its

meaning of the term "expert" as used in the Securities Act of 1933, nor did it
admit that its opinion constitutes a report or valuation within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933. The Thomas Weisel Partners opinion includes
statements to this effect.

     In connection with its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners, among other things:

     - reviewed certain publicly available financial and other data with respect
       to NetSilicon and Digi, including the consolidated financial statements
       for recent years and interim periods to July 28, 2001

       with respect to NetSilicon and June 30, 2001 with respect to Digi, and
       certain other relevant financial and operating data relating to
       NetSilicon and Digi made available to Thomas Weisel Partners from
       published sources and from the internal records of both companies;

     - reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the merger agreement;

     - reviewed certain publicly available information concerning the trading
       of, and the trading market for, NetSilicon's and Digi's common stock;

     - compared NetSilicon and Digi from a financial point of view with certain
       other companies in the communication technology industry generally which
       Thomas Weisel Partners deemed to be relevant;

     - considered the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of
       selected recent business combinations of companies in the communication
       technology industry generally which Thomas Weisel Partners deemed to be
       relevant, in whole or in part, to the merger;

     - reviewed and discussed with representatives of the management of
       NetSilicon and Digi certain information of a business and financial
       nature regarding NetSilicon and Digi, furnished to Thomas Weisel Partners
       by them, including financial forecasts and related assumptions for
       NetSilicon and Digi;

     - made inquiries regarding and discussed the merger and the merger
       agreement and other matters related thereto with NetSilicon's counsel;
       and

     - performed such other analyses and examinations as Thomas Weisel Partners
       deemed appropriate.

     In preparing its opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners did not assume any
obligation to independently verify the information referred to above. Instead,
with NetSilicon's consent, Thomas Weisel Partners relied on the information
being accurate and complete in all material respects. Thomas Weisel Partners
also made the following assumptions, in each case with NetSilicon's consent:

     - with respect to the financial forecasts for NetSilicon and Digi described
       above, Thomas Weisel Partners assumed for purposes of its opinion, upon
       the advice of management of NetSilicon and Digi, that (a) these forecasts
       have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best available
       estimates and judgments of management of NetSilicon and Digi at the time
       of preparation as to the future financial performance of NetSilicon and
       Digi, and (b) these forecasts provide a reasonable basis upon which
       Thomas Weisel Partners could form its opinion;

     - that there have been no material changes in NetSilicon's or Digi's
       assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects
       since the respective dates of their last financial statements made
       available to Thomas Weisel Partners;

     - that the merger that will be consummated in a manner that complies in all
       material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of
       1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and all other applicable
       federal and state statutes, rules and regulations;

     - that the merger will be recorded as a purchase under generally accepted
       accounting principles;

     - that all non-voting shares of NetSilicon's common stock will convert into
       Digi's common stock or cash in connection with the merger on the same
       terms as the voting stock; and

     - that the transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms
       described in the merger agreement without further amendment thereto, and
       without any waiver by NetSilicon of any of the conditions to any party's
       obligations thereunder.

     In addition, for purposes of its opinion:

     - Thomas Weisel Partners relied on advice of NetSilicon's counsel and
       independent accountants as to all legal and financial reporting matters
       with respect to NetSilicon, the merger and the merger agreement,
       including the legal status and financial reporting of litigation
       involving NetSilicon; and

     - Thomas Weisel Partners did not assume responsibility for making an
       independent evaluation, appraisal or physical inspection of the assets or
       liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of NetSilicon or Digi, nor was
       Thomas Weisel Partners furnished with any such appraisals.

     The Thomas Weisel Partners opinion was based on economic, monetary, market
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
Thomas Weisel Partners as of, the date of its opinion. The opinion expressed by
Thomas Weisel Partners was rendered during a period of unusual volatility in the
financial markets and may be affected by material developments in the economic,
monetary and market and other conditions from those prevailing on the date of
the opinion. Accordingly, although subsequent developments may affect its
opinion, Thomas Weisel Partners has not assumed any obligation to update, revise
or reaffirm its opinion.

     The following represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses
performed by Thomas Weisel Partners in connection with providing its opinion to
the board of directors of NetSilicon. Some of the summaries of financial
analyses performed by Thomas Weisel Partners include information presented in
tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by
Thomas Weisel Partners, you should read the tables together with the text of
each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the
financial analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without
considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including
the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by Thomas
Weisel Partners.

     Comparable Company Valuation Analysis.  Based on public and other available
information, Thomas Weisel Partners calculated the aggregate value, which Thomas
Weisel Partners defined as equity value plus total debt less cash and cash
equivalents, as a multiple of estimated revenue for companies in the
communication technology industry for calendar years 2001 and 2002. Thomas
Weisel Partners believes that the following 11 companies listed below have
operations similar to some of the operations of NetSilicon, but noted that none
of these companies has the same management, composition, size or combination of
businesses as NetSilicon: 3Com Corporation, Advanced Electronics, Avocent
Corporation, Cirrus Logic, Inc., Echelon Corporation, Lantronix, Inc., Network
Technologies, Inc., Oak Technology, Inc., Peerless Systems Group, RadiSys
Corporation and Standard Microsystems.

     The following table sets forth the multiples indicated by this analysis and
the price per share range implied by the proposed merger:

                                                          IMPLIED PRICE PER
  AGGREGATE VALUE TO     NETSILICON     VALUATION RANGE      SHARE RANGE
  ------------------    -------------   ---------------   -----------------

2001 Estimated Revenue  $28.6 million      0.6x-6.3x        $2.01-$11.70
2002 Estimated Revenue  $37.4 million      0.5x-4.8x        $2.19-$11.70

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the per-share value of the consideration
to be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon in connection with the merger,
$3.58, fell within the ranges indicated by this analysis.

     While the comparable company valuation analysis compared NetSilicon to 11
public companies in the communication technology industry, Thomas Weisel
Partners did not include every company that could be deemed to be a participant
in this same industry, or in the specific sectors of this industry.

     Comparable Transactions Analysis.  Based on public and other available
information, Thomas Weisel Partners calculated aggregate value as a multiple of
revenue for the last 12 months, or LTM, and for the

next 12 months, or NTM, in 11 particularly comparable acquisitions of
communication technology companies that have been announced since March 2, 1998:

ANNOUNCEMENT DATE           NAME OF ACQUIROR                  NAME OF TARGET COMPANY
- -----------------           ----------------                  ----------------------

October 1, 2001    GlobeSpan, Inc.                      Virata Corporation
July 2, 2001       RadiSys Corporation                  Microware Systems Corporation
October 27, 2000   Microchip Technology, Inc.           TelCom Semiconductor, Inc.
August 24, 2000    Zoran Corporation                    Nogatech, Inc.
January 28, 2000   International Rectifier Corporation  Zing Technologies, Inc.
July 29, 1999      Oak Technology, Inc.                 Xionics Document Technologies, Inc.
May 3, 1999        Texas Instruments Inc.               Integrated Sensor Solutions, Inc.
February 22, 1999  LSI Logic Corporation                SEEQ Technology, Inc.
December 22, 1998  STMicroelectronics NV                Vision Group PLC
November 2, 1998   Integrated Device Technology, Inc.   Quality Semiconductor, Inc.
March 2, 1998      Unitrode Corporation                 Benchmarq Microelectronics, Inc.

          The following table sets forth the multiples indicated by this
     analysis and the price per share range implied by the proposed merger:

                                                                             IMPLIED PRICE PER
AGGREGATE VALUE TO                          NETSILICON     VALUATION RANGE      SHARE RANGE
- ------------------                         -------------   ---------------   -----------------

LTM Revenue..............................  $32.6 million      0.6x-3.8x         $2.26-$8.66
NTM Revenue..............................  $31.2 million      1.3x-2.1x         $3.73-$5.36

     Thomas Weisel Partners observed that while the per share value of the
consideration to be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon in connection
with the merger, $3.58, with respect to LTM revenue was within the range
indicated by comparable transactions, such per share value with respect to NTM
revenue fell below the range indicated by comparable transactions. Thomas Weisel
Partners noted this fact, but as discussed below, comparable transactions
analysis was just one of several analyses used by Thomas Weisel Partners to
reach its fairness determination. No company or transaction used in the
comparable company or comparable transactions analyses is identical to
NetSilicon, Digi or the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the
foregoing is not mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of
the companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of
the companies to which NetSilicon, Digi and the transaction are being compared.

     Thomas Weisel Partners also calculated for these same 11 transactions
premiums paid over the average share price of the acquired company as of five
trading days and 20 trading days prior to the announcement of the acquisition
offer, as well as the premiums paid over the average exchange ratio as of one
trading day, five trading days and 20 trading days prior to the announcement of
the acquisition offer.

     The following table shows the premiums paid over the share price of the
acquired company with respect to these comparable acquisition transactions:

                                                                              IMPLIED PRICE PER
                                               NETSILICON   VALUATION RANGE      SHARE RANGE
                                               ----------   ---------------   -----------------

Premium Five Days Prior To Announcement......    $2.75          (3)%-79%         $2.65-$4.92
Premium 20 Days Prior To Announcement........    $2.51         (14)%-86%         $2.17-$4.66

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the per share value of the consideration
to be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon in connection with the merger,
$3.58, fell within these ranges.

     The following table shows the premiums paid over the average exchange ratio
with respect to these comparable acquisition transactions:

                                                                              IMPLIED PRICE PER
                                               NETSILICON   VALUATION RANGE      SHARE RANGE
                                               ----------   ---------------   -----------------

Premium One Day Prior To Announcement........    0.44x          (8)%-66%         $2.22-$3.98
Premium Five Days Prior To Announcement......    0.48x            4%-67%         $2.74-$4.39
Premium 20 Days Prior To Announcement........    0.48x         (12)%-82%         $2.32-$4.81

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the per share value of the consideration
to be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon in connection with the merger,
$3.58, fell within these ranges.

     Technology Transactions Analysis.  Thomas Weisel Partners reviewed the
consideration and premiums paid in comparable acquisitions by acquirors in 63
selected transactions involving technology companies. The transactions selected
were those with an aggregate value of at least $20 million and announced since
January 1, 2000. Thomas Weisel Partners calculated the premiums paid in these
transactions over the share price of the acquired company as of five trading
days and 20 trading days prior to the announcement of acquisition offer, as well
as the premiums paid over the average exchange ratio as of one trading day, five
trading days and 20 trading days prior to the announcement of the acquisition
offer.

     The following table shows the premiums paid over the average share price of
the acquired company with respect to these technology transactions:

                                                                              IMPLIED PRICE PER
                                               NETSILICON   VALUATION RANGE      SHARE RANGE
                                               ----------   ---------------   -----------------

Premium Five Days Prior To Announcement......    $2.75        (52)%-141%         $1.32-$6.62
Premium 20 Days Prior To Announcement........    $2.51        (48)%-130%         $1.30-$5.77

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the per share value of the consideration
to be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon in connection with the merger,
$3.58, fell within these ranges.

     The following table shows the premiums paid over the average exchange ratio
with respect to these technology transactions:

                                                                              IMPLIED PRICE PER
                                               NETSILICON   VALUATION RANGE      SHARE RANGE
                                               ----------   ---------------   -----------------

Premium One Day Prior To Announcement........    0.44x        (54)%-120%         $1.10-$5.27
Premium Five Days Prior To Announcement......    0.48x        (58)%-113%         $1.11-$5.60
Premium 20 Days Prior To Announcement........    0.48x        (56)%-129%         $1.17-$6.03

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that the per share value of the consideration
to be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon in connection with the merger,
$3.58, fell within these ranges.

     Contribution Analysis.  Based on public and other available information,
Thomas Weisel Partners reviewed the estimated contribution of each of NetSilicon
and Digi to estimated total revenues for the combined company for calendar year
2002. Thomas Weisel Partners then compared these contributions to the forecasted
share ownership of the combined company to be owned by the stockholders of
NetSilicon, assuming consummation of the merger as described in the merger
agreement. This analysis indicated an implied percentage revenue contribution
range for NetSilicon of approximately 10% to 37% in the combined company, as
compared to the forecasted share ownership by the stockholders of NetSilicon of
approximately 29.7% in the combined company based on the exchange ratio.

     Thomas Weisel Partners noted that with respect to this revenue contribution
analysis, the implied per share value for NetSilicon ranged from (a) $1.15 to
$2.62, based on Digi's aggregate value, which is calculated as equity value plus
total debt less cash and cash equivalents and (b) $0.67 to $3.50, based on
Digi's equity value, which is calculated on the basis of the closing stock price
on October 29, 2001.

Thomas Weisel Partners observed that the per share value of the consideration to
be received by the stockholders of NetSilicon in connection with the merger,
$3.58, exceeded these ranges.

     The foregoing description is only a summary of the analyses and
examinations that Thomas Weisel Partners deems material to its opinion. It is
not a comprehensive description of all analyses and examinations actually
conducted by Thomas Weisel Partners. The preparation of a fairness opinion
necessarily is not susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
Thomas Weisel Partners believes that its analyses and the summary set forth
above must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses
and of the factors considered, without considering all analyses and factors,
would create an incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses set forth
in its presentation to the board of directors of NetSilicon. In addition, Thomas
Weisel Partners may have given various analyses more or less weight than other
analyses, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than
other assumptions. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in
the summary above is not meant to indicate that this analysis was given greater
weight than any other analysis. Accordingly, the ranges of valuations resulting
from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be the view
of Thomas Weisel Partners with respect to the actual value of NetSilicon.

     In performing its analyses, Thomas Weisel Partners made numerous
assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of NetSilicon
and Digi. The analyses performed by Thomas Weisel Partners are not necessarily
indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be significantly
more or less favorable than those suggested by these analyses. These analyses
were prepared solely as part of the analysis performed by Thomas Weisel Partners
with respect to the financial fairness of the consideration to be received by
NetSilicon's stockholders pursuant to the transaction, and were provided to the
board of directors of NetSilicon in connection with the delivery of the Thomas
Weisel Partners opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to
reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at
which any securities may trade at any time in the future.

     As described above, Thomas Weisel Partners' opinion and presentation were
among the many factors that the board of directors of NetSilicon took into
consideration in making its determination to approve, and to recommend that
NetSilicon's stockholders approve, the merger agreement and the merger.

     Pursuant to the terms of an engagement letter, NetSilicon agreed to pay to
Thomas Weisel Partners a customary financial advisory fee, a substantial portion
of which will be received upon the consummation of the merger. The board of
directors of NetSilicon was aware of this fee structure and took it into account
in considering the Thomas Weisel Partners opinion and in approving the merger.
Further, NetSilicon has agreed to reimburse Thomas Weisel Partners for its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and to indemnify Thomas Weisel Partners, its
affiliates, and their respective, directors, officers, agents, consultants,
employees and controlling persons against specific liabilities, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

     NetSilicon selected Thomas Weisel Partners to act as its financial advisor
in connection with the merger based on Thomas Weisel Partners' experience,
expertise and reputation, and its familiarity with NetSilicon's business. Thomas
Weisel Partners is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and is
regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, negotiated underwritings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of its
business, Thomas Weisel Partners actively trades the equity securities of
NetSilicon for its own account and for the accounts of customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in these securities.

NETSILICON PROJECTIONS PROVIDED TO DIGI

     NetSilicon provided Digi with projections that NetSilicon prepared of its
future financial performance for the fiscal years ending January 31, 2003 and
2004. The material portions of these projections reflected projected total
revenues of approximately $39.0 million, and $62.0 million respectively, total
costs and

expenses of approximately $38.0 million and $59.0 million respectively, and
earnings from operations of approximately $1.0 million and $3.0 million,
respectively.

     The statements regarding NetSilicon's financial projections constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act and are subject to the safe
harbors created under these sections. In light of the significant uncertainties
inherent in forward-looking financial information of any kind, our including
this information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded
as a representation that the financial projections will be achieved. You are
cautioned that these financial projections should not be regarded as fact and
should not be relied upon as an accurate representation of future results. The
projections were not examined, reviewed, or compiled by BDO Seidman, LLP,
NetSilicon's independent auditors. BDO Seidman assumes no responsibility for the
projections, they do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on
the projections, and they disclaim any association with the projections. The
projections were not prepared in accordance with the standards for prospective
financial information established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. The financial projections were prepared by, and are the sole
responsibility of, NetSilicon's management for internal budgeting and planning
purposes and not for the purposes of the proposed merger. They were based on
numerous subjective estimates and other assumptions and are inherently subject
to significant uncertainties and contingencies. Further, there have been and
will be differences between actual and forecasted results, and these differences
may be material. As disclosed elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
under "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," NetSilicon's
business and operations are subject to substantial risks that increase the
uncertainty inherent in the financial projections. Any of the factors disclosed
under "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" could cause
the actual results to differ materially from the financial projections described
above.

     The financial projections were prepared by NetSilicon in September 2001 as
part of NetSilicon's normal forecasting process for 2003 and 2004, and do not
reflect or take into account any circumstances or events occurring after that
date. In addition, the financial projections were prepared on the assumption
that NetSilicon remained an independent company, and it is highly likely that
the contribution of NetSilicon's business to Digi's consolidated results will be
different from NetSilicon's performance on a stand-alone basis. In analyzing the
potential benefits of the transaction with NetSilicon, Digi did not assume that
the financial projections provided by NetSilicon would be achieved. Digi and
NetSilicon disclaim any duty to update or otherwise publicly revise the
projections and make no representations as to whether the projections will be
achieved.

INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF NETSILICON IN THE MERGER

     When considering the recommendation of NetSilicon's board of directors
regarding the merger, NetSilicon stockholders should be aware that some of
NetSilicon's directors and officers have interests in the merger that are
different from, or in addition to, other stockholders' interests. NetSilicon's
board of directors was aware of these interests before approving the merger
agreement. The interests include the following:

     Ownership and Voting Stock.  As of                , 200  , the directors
and executive officers beneficially owned                shares of NetSilicon
common stock, including stock options to purchase                shares of
NetSilicon common stock, exercisable within 60 days of                , 200  ,
representing in the aggregate approximately      % of the outstanding shares of
NetSilicon common stock. Additionally, each of the directors and executive
officers of NetSilicon who owns NetSilicon stock has agreed, pursuant to the
terms of a voting agreement, to vote for the approval of the merger agreement
and the merger.

     Accelerated Stock Option Vesting.  Assuming the completion of the merger as
of                , 2002, unvested options to purchase shares of NetSilicon
common stock held by NetSilicon's directors will vest and become immediately
exercisable upon the completion of the merger and will be exercisable for the
balance of their scheduled terms.

     Peterson Employment Agreement.  NetSilicon has entered into an amended
employment agreement with NetSilicon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Cornelius Peterson, VIII, which takes effect on December 28, 2001 if the merger
agreement has not been terminated and if Digi has no right to terminate the
merger agreement on that date. This agreement provides that, in the event of a
change of control, such as the merger, Mr. Peterson's unvested stock options
will vest immediately and all of Mr. Peterson's stock options will remain in
full force and effect and may be exercised at any time up to their latest
possible date of expiration as set forth in each stock option agreement. Mr.
Peterson will also receive a one-time payment of $740,000 on December 28, 2001.
If the merger is not subsequently consummated, Mr. Peterson will receive an
additional payment of $10,000, which, along with the $740,000, would constitute
prepaid salary for a period of three years. If Mr. Peterson voluntarily
terminates his employment prior to the end of that three-year period, he must
repay the unearned portion of that prepaid salary.

     Additionally, pursuant to that agreement, NetSilicon has agreed to forgive
the payment obligations of two promissory notes in the aggregate principal
amount of $871,207.80 plus interest made by Mr. Peterson and provide additional
payments necessary to cover any taxes owed by Mr. Peterson as a result of the
forgiveness and the additional payment. These payments will be made on December
28, 2001 if the amended employment agreement takes effect.

     Under the agreement, if Mr. Peterson terminates his employment for good
reason (as defined in the agreement) or is terminated without cause, Mr.
Peterson is entitled to receive payment for accrued but unused vacation time,
payment for unpaid reimbursable expenses, acceleration of unvested options and
continuation of health coverage including obtaining a medicare supplement policy
for Mr. Peterson and his spouse subject to the specific terms of the agreement.
If, and only if, the merger is not consummated, he will also be entitled to
receive continuation of his base salary (as defined in the agreement) for two
years and a lump-sum cash payment equal to one year of salary (which payments
will each be offset by the unearned portion of the prepaid salary described
above).

     Additionally, if any payment or benefit to which Mr. Peterson is entitled
under the employment agreement constitutes a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, and as a result Mr.
Peterson is subject to an excise tax, NetSilicon will pay to Mr. Peterson an
additional amount, which is intended to make Mr. Peterson whole for payment of
the excise tax. This "gross-up" amount will equal the amount of the excise tax
(including the aggregate amount of any interest, penalties, fines or additions
imposed in connection with the imposition or such excise tax), plus all income,
excise and other applicable taxes imposed on Mr. Peterson under any federal,
state or local government or taxing authority by reason of those payments.

     Finally, Mr. Peterson has also entered into an amended and restated
employment agreement with Digi that will become effective only upon consummation
of the merger and will continue for eighteen months after the consummation of
the merger unless sooner terminated. Under this agreement, Mr. Peterson will
serve as Digi's Senior Vice President of Business Development. The other terms
of this agreement are substantially similar to the agreement Mr. Peterson
currently has with NetSilicon.

     Sullivan Employment Agreement.  NetSilicon and Digi have entered into an
amended employment agreement with Daniel J. Sullivan, NetSilicon's Chief
Financial Officer, in connection with the merger. Under this agreement, Mr.
Sullivan's unvested stock options will vest immediately upon the consummation of
a change of control, such as the merger. Mr. Sullivan's options with a per-share
exercise price of $7.00 or less will become exercisable for Digi common stock
for a period of 24 months following the consummation of the merger. Upon
consummation of the merger, Digi will pay Mr. Sullivan a retention bonus of
$80,000, which will be paid bi-weekly over a period of six months, provided
that, if Mr. Sullivan's employment is terminated prior to the end of such
six-month period for any reason other than termination by Digi without cause,
Mr. Sullivan would not be entitled to any such payment and would be required to
repay any amounts already paid to him. If Mr. Sullivan is terminated without
cause during the six-month period, he would be entitled to the entire retention
bonus. Additionally, Mr. Sullivan will receive a bonus of $80,000 upon
consummation of the merger and an additional $80,000 six months following the
consummation of the merger.

     In addition, Mr. Sullivan is entitled to receive a bonus equal to .0025% of
the total merger consideration paid upon the successful completion of the
merger.

     Finally, if any payment or benefit to which Mr. Sullivan is entitled
constitutes a "parachute payment" pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, and as
a result is subject to an excise tax, Mr. Sullivan will receive an additional
amount that is intended to make Mr. Sullivan whole for payment of the excise
tax. This "gross-up" amount will equal the amount of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without
limitation, any income taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with
respect to such taxes) and excise tax imposed upon the gross-up amount.

     Other Executive Officers' Employment Agreements.  Digi has entered into
other employment agreements with certain NetSilicon employees, which will take
effect upon consummation of the merger. Digi has entered into an employment
agreement with William Peisel which provides for 12 months of severance if he is
terminated at any time without cause. In addition, Digi will recommend the
issuance to him of stock options to purchase 50,000 shares of Digi common stock.
Mr. Peisel's existing stock option agreements have also been amended in
connection with the merger. Under the amendments, if Mr. Peisel's employment is
terminated without cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason (as
such terms are defined in the amended stock option agreements), his stock
options will immediately vest and become exercisable for a period of 24 months
following the date of termination.

     Pursuant to an amended employment agreement between Michael Evensen,
NetSilicon and Digi, Digi will recommend the issuance to him of stock options to
purchase 50,000 shares of Digi common stock that would vest and become
exercisable for 24 months from the consummation of the merger. The agreement
also provides for Mr. Evensen to be employed as a General Manager of Digi for a
term of 24 months, and entitles him to participate in Digi's sales compensation
plan. The agreement will automatically renew for successive one year periods
unless terminated 60 days before the end of the term.

     Pursuant to an amended employment agreement between Hiroyuki Kataoka,
NetSilicon and Digi, Mr. Kataoka will be entitled to received a gross payment of
$500,000 immediately prior to the consummation of the merger. NetSilicon
previously agreed to make this payment to Mr. Kataoka in connection with
NetSilicon's purchase of certain assets of Dimatech Corp. In addition, Digi will
recommend the issuance to him of stock options to purchase 50,000 shares of Digi
common stock that would vest and become exercisable for 24 months from the
consummation of the merger. The agreement provides for a 24-month employment
term for Mr. Kataoka, unless he is sooner terminated, and entitles him to
participate in Digi's sales compensation plan. The agreement will automatically
renew for successive one year periods unless terminated 60 days before the end
of the term.

     Directorship.  After completion of the merger, Digi has agreed to appoint
Cornelius Peterson, VIII, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
of NetSilicon, to Digi's board of directors.

     Indemnification and Insurance.  Under the merger agreement, for six years
after the closing of the merger, Digi will cause the surviving company to
indemnify NetSilicon's (or any of its subsidiaries') present and former
directors, officers or employees for acts or omissions occurring before the
completion of the merger to the extent provided under NetSilicon's articles of
incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational document in effect on the date
of the merger agreement. For six years after the closing of the merger, Digi
will cause the surviving company to provide directors' and officers' liability
insurance for acts or omissions occurring at or before the completion of the
merger covering each such person currently covered by NetSilicon's directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those in effect on the date of the merger
agreement, but only to the extent that the cost of such insurance does not
exceed 200% of the average annual premium currently paid by NetSilicon.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     The merger will be accounted for as a "purchase" for financial reporting
purposes. After the completion of the merger, the results of operations of
NetSilicon will be included in the consolidated financial statements of Digi.
The purchase price will be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities

based on their fair values. Any excess of cost over the fair value of the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets of NetSilicon acquired will be
recorded as goodwill. No amortization expense will be recognized for the
goodwill generated as a result of the merger, although such goodwill will be
subject to periodic reviews for impairment. A final determination of the
intangible asset lives and required purchase accounting adjustments, including
the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their respective fair values, has not yet been made.
Accordingly, the purchase accounting adjustments made in connection with the
development of the unaudited pro forma financial information appearing elsewhere
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are preliminary and have been made
solely for purposes of developing the unaudited pro forma financial information.
For financial reporting purposes, the results of operations of NetSilicon will
be included in Digi's statement of operations following the effective time of
the merger and Digi's historical statements of operations will not be restated.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

     The following discussion summarizes material federal income tax
consequences of the merger to holders of NetSilicon common stock, and to Digi,
Dove Sub, and NetSilicon. The discussion is based on the current provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code, existing and proposed Treasury Regulations,
interpretive rulings of the Internal Revenue Service, and court decisions, all
of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect.
Any such change could affect the continuing validity of this summary.

     Holders of NetSilicon common stock should be aware that this discussion
does not deal with all federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to
all stockholders in light of their particular circumstances. For example, the
discussion may not be applicable to insurance companies, tax-exempt
organizations, financial institutions, nonresident alien individuals, or foreign
entities. Others with special considerations include those who are subject to
the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, who
acquired their shares in connection with stock options or in other compensatory
transactions, who hold shares in a hedging transaction or as part of a straddle
or conversion transaction, or who hold NetSilicon stock options to be assumed by
Digi in the merger. In addition, the following discussion does not address the
tax consequences of the merger under foreign, state, local, and other tax laws.
The discussion assumes that the NetSilicon common stock is a capital asset in
the hands of the holder.

     ACCORDINGLY, HOLDERS OF NETSILICON COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR
OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER IN
THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

     Neither Digi nor NetSilicon will request a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service in connection with the merger. The merger agreement provides that the
obligation of NetSilicon and Digi to complete the merger is subject to the
receipt of a written opinion from their respective legal counsel that the merger
will constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. The condition regarding the receipt of the tax opinion may be waived, but
neither NetSilicon nor Digi has any current intention to do so.

     The tax opinions will not bind the IRS or any court, and the IRS may assert
a contrary position. The tax opinions will be subject to assumptions and
qualifications, including the truth and accuracy of representations made by
NetSilicon, Digi, and Dove Sub in certificates to be delivered to counsel.

     Subject to the limitations and qualifications referred to in this section
and assuming that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the merger will generally result
in the following federal income tax consequences to the holders of NetSilicon
common stock and to Digi, Dove Sub, and NetSilicon:

     1.  A holder of NetSilicon common stock generally will not recognize gain
         or loss with respect to shares of Digi common stock received in the
         merger.

     2.  A holder of NetSilicon common stock generally will recognize gain, but
         not loss, equal to the lesser of the gain realized or the cash (other
         than cash received in lieu of a fractional share) received in the
         merger. The gain realized will equal the fair market value of the total
         consideration received in the merger minus the adjusted tax basis of
         the holder's NetSilicon common stock exchanged therefor.

     3.  Gain recognized by a holder of NetSilicon common stock will generally
         be capital gain, but may, under some circumstances, constitute dividend
         income. See paragraph 9 below.

     4.  The tax basis of the Digi common stock to be received by a holder of
         NetSilicon common stock (including fractional shares that are deemed to
         be issued) will be equal to the tax basis of the NetSilicon common
         stock surrendered in the merger, decreased by the cash received in the
         merger and increased by the amount of gain recognized as a result of
         the merger.

     5.  The holding period of the Digi common stock received by a holder of
         NetSilicon common stock will include the holding period for the
         NetSilicon common stock exchanged therefor.

     6.  A holder of NetSilicon common stock who receives cash in lieu of a
         fractional share of Digi common stock will be treated as having
         received a fractional share in the merger and then having received cash
         in exchange for the fractional share in a redemption described in
         Section 302(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, the holder
         will generally recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the
         difference, if any, between the amount of cash received in lieu of the
         fractional share and the holder's tax basis in the fractional share
         treated as having been redeemed.

     7.  A holder of NetSilicon common stock who exercises appraisal rights and
         receives a cash payment for his or her stock generally should recognize
         capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the holder's
         tax basis in the stock and the amount of cash received, other than any
         amounts treated as interest.

     8.  Gain or loss will generally not be recognized by Digi, Dove Sub, or
         NetSilicon as a result of the merger.

     9.  Although gain recognized by a holder of NetSilicon common stock who
         exchanges such stock for Digi common stock and cash in the merger or
         who exercises appraisal rights and receives a cash payment may be
         capital gain, there are circumstances, in which all or part of the gain
         recognized by such holder would be treated as a dividend rather than
         capital gain. Such circumstances depend on the number of shares of
         NetSilicon common stock as to which NetSilicon stockholders elect to
         receive cash or exercise appraisal rights, the market price of Digi
         common stock as of the effective time of the merger, the number of Digi
         and NetSilicon common shares held by a holder and related parties,
         whether such NetSilicon shares are held at a gain and the amount
         thereof, and the amount of the accumulated earnings and profits of
         NetSilicon for federal income tax purposes. Because the application of
         dividend treatment depends in part upon each holder's particular
         circumstances, holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding
         the tax consequences of the merger to them. Holders who wish to avoid
         dividend treatment should consider forgoing the election to receive
         cash in the merger and instead sell on the open market some or all of
         the Digi common stock received in the merger.

     10.  Certain noncorporate holders of NetSilicon common stock may be subject
          to backup withholding at a 30% rate on reportable payments received in
          exchange for NetSilicon common stock, including any amount received in
          lieu of fractional shares, or received by a noncorporate holder who
          exercises his or her dissenters' rights. Backup withholding generally
          will not apply, however, to a holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer
          identification number and certifies under penalties of perjury that
          such number is correct and that he or she is not subject to backup
          withholding on the substitute Form W-9 included in the enclosed letter
          of transmittal, or is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.

     If the merger fails to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code, then NetSilicon stockholders would recognize taxable
gain or loss with respect to each share of NetSilicon common stock surrendered
equal to the difference between the stockholder's basis in the share and the sum
of the cash and the fair market value, as of the effective time of the merger,
of the Digi common stock received in exchange for the share. In such an event, a
stockholder's aggregate basis in the Digi common stock so received would equal
its fair market value and the stockholder's holding period for that stock would
begin on the day after the effective time of the merger. In addition, NetSilicon
would be treated as if it made a taxable sale or exchange of its assets.

     Each holder of NetSilicon common stock who participates in the merger will
be required to incorporate in the holder's federal income tax return for the
taxable year that includes the effective time of the merger a complete statement
of facts relating to the merger and to retain permanent records showing the
holder's tax basis in the NetSilicon common stock exchanged in the merger and
the amount of Digi common stock and cash received therefor.

     THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX
EFFECTS RELEVANT TO THE MERGER. HOLDERS OF NETSILICON COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
TO THEM, INCLUDING TAX RETURN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, THE APPLICABILITY AND
EFFECT OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND OTHER TAX LAWS, AND THE EFFECTS OF ANY
CHANGES IN THE TAX LAWS.

REGULATORY MATTERS

     We are not aware of any significant regulatory approvals currently required
for the merger. The present aggregate value of the merger consideration is such
that the companies are not required to make the notice filings required under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. If the value increases
materially, then we may have to make those filings.

FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS CONSEQUENCES; STOCK TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

     All shares of Digi common stock received by NetSilicon stockholders in the
merger are registered under the Securities Act and will be freely tradable
without restriction by people who will not be "affiliates" of Digi after the
merger or who were not "affiliates" of NetSilicon on the date of the NetSilicon
stockholders meeting. Any of these "affiliates" may resell the Digi common stock
received by him in the merger only if the shares are registered for resale under
the Securities Act or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act is
available. Those people may be permitted to effect resales under the safe-harbor
provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, or Rule 144 in the case of
persons who become "affiliates" of Digi, or as otherwise permitted under the
Securities Act. People who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of NetSilicon or
Digi generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by,
or are under common control with, NetSilicon or Digi, as applicable, and may
include some officers and all directors of that party as well as principal
stockholders of NetSilicon or Digi, as applicable. Sorrento Networks
Corporation, as a holder of NetSilicon non-voting common stock, is not
considered to be an affiliate of NetSilicon, and will not be considered an
affiliate of Digi after the merger. We recommend that any of those people obtain
advice of securities counsel before making any resale.

     The merger agreement provides that,

     - on or before the date of the NetSilicon stockholders meeting, NetSilicon
       will deliver to Digi a letter identifying all people who may be deemed to
       be affiliates of NetSilicon for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
       Act; and

     - on or before the date of the NetSilicon stockholders meeting, NetSilicon
       will use reasonable best efforts to cause each of its "affiliates" to
       deliver a written agreement to the effect that the "affiliate" will not
       offer or sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of Digi common stock
       received in the merger in violation of the Securities Act or the rules
       and regulations under the Securities Act.

     This joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of Digi common
stock received by any person who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Digi or
NetSilicon.

                              THE MERGER AGREEMENT

GENERAL

     The following is a summary of the material terms of the merger agreement.
The complete text of the merger agreement is incorporated by reference and
attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus. We encourage you
to read the merger agreement in its entirety.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER

     Under the merger agreement, NetSilicon will merge with and into a wholly
owned subsidiary of Digi. As a result of the merger, NetSilicon will effectively
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Digi.

CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME

     The merger will become effective when we file certificates of merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Secretary of the
Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. However, we may agree to a
later time and specify that time in the certificates of merger. We expect to
file the certificates of merger and to complete the merger shortly after the
stockholders meetings of Digi and NetSilicon, assuming the stockholders of both
companies approve the merger and the other conditions in the merger agreement
are satisfied or waived. See "-- Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" on
page   for a discussion of these conditions.

NETSILICON STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     Digi will assume 4,086,064 unexercised stock options to purchase shares of
NetSilicon common stock with a per-share exercise price of $7.00 or less and
150,000 of such options issued to Cornelius Peterson, VIII with a per-share
exercise price of $18.00. Once assumed, those options will be converted into
options to acquire, on substantially the same terms as under the NetSilicon
stock plan and related agreements under which they were granted, shares of Digi
common stock equal to the number of shares of NetSilicon common stock subject to
the options multiplied by .65. Those assumed options will have a per-share
exercise price equal to the exercise price per share for the shares of
NetSilicon common stock which were purchasable pursuant to the NetSilicon stock
option divided by .65.

     Except as discussed above, Digi will not assume 1,044,525 NetSilicon stock
options with a per-share exercise price greater than $7.00. These options are
immediately exercisable in full until they terminate, by their terms, 30 days
after the date of NetSilicon's notice to that effect, which will be mailed
shortly after this joint proxy statement/prospectus is mailed.

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

     During the period from the date of the merger agreement to the consummation
of the merger, each of us must comply with agreements relating to the conduct of
our respective businesses, except as otherwise permitted by the merger agreement
or as consented to by the other party.

     Each of us has agreed that we will:

       franchises;

     - use our reasonable best efforts to keep available the services of our

       result in any of the conditions to the merger not being satisfied, or
       preventing, materially delaying, or materially impeding the consummation
       of the merger, with specified permitted exceptions.

     In addition, NetSilicon is prohibited from taking the following actions,
except as permitted by the merger agreement or as consented by Digi:

     - issuing shares of NetSilicon capital stock or options to purchase its
       capital stock or securities convertible into its capital stock, with
       specified permitted exceptions, or designating any class or series of

       NetSilicon's wholly owned subsidiaries;

     - relinquishing material contractual or other rights or claims, with
       specified permitted exceptions; or

     - knowingly disposing of or permitting to lapse any of NetSilicon's
       material propriety rights, with specified permitted exceptions.

     Each of us has also agreed that we will not, other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, make any material tax election
or settle or compromise any tax liability, and that we will notify each other of
any request to extend the time to file any of our tax returns.

     In addition, we have each agreed to use reasonable efforts to obtain any
third-party consents necessary to consummate the merger, and to notify each
other of the failure to obtain any necessary consents.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     Board of Directors' Covenant to Recommend.  NetSilicon has agreed that its
board of directors will recommend approval of the merger agreement and the
merger by NetSilicon stockholders and will use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies in connection with the NetSilicon stockholders meeting in favor
of the merger proposal. However, NetSilicon's board need not recommend approval
of the merger agreement and the merger nor need it solicit those proxies if
NetSilicon has received a superior acquisition proposal and the board determines
that it wishes to recommend approval of the superior acquisition proposal. The
concept of a "superior acquisition proposal" is explained below under "-- No
Solicitation."

     Digi has agreed that its board of directors will recommend approval of the
issuance of common stock in the merger by stockholders of Digi and will use it
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in connection with the Digi
stockholders meeting in favor of approval of the stock issuance.

     No Solicitation.  NetSilicon may not, and may not permit any of its
officers, directors, financial advisors, or other agents or representatives to,
take any action to solicit any third-party acquisition offer. In the merger
agreement, we define a third-party acquisition offer as any offer to:

     - acquire any shares of capital stock of NetSilicon or its subsidiaries;

     - merge or consolidate with NetSilicon or any of its subsidiaries; or

     - otherwise acquire, except to the extent not prohibited by the merger
       agreement, any significant portion of the assets of NetSilicon and its
       subsidiaries, taken as whole.

     If NetSilicon receives a third-party acquisition offer from any person or
group that is an offer to acquire, by tender offer, merger, acquisition of
assets, or otherwise, 40% or more of the outstanding shares or assets of
NetSilicon, then NetSilicon and its officers, directors, financial advisors, or
other agents or representatives to, may, directly or indirectly:

     - engage in discussions or negotiations concerning the offer;

     - disclose financial information, or any confidential or proprietary trade
       or business information, relating to NetSilicon;

     - afford access to its properties, books, or records; or

     - otherwise cooperate in any way with any person or group that it has
       reason to believe is considering a third-party acquisition offer;

only if NetSilicon has received from the offeror an executed confidentiality and
standstill agreement that is no less favorable to NetSilicon than the
confidentiality agreement dated May 17, 2001, between Thomas Weisel Partners and
Digi and the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated May 25, 2001, between
NetSilicon and Thomas Weisel Partners, and NetSilicon must provide to Digi all
information provided to the offeror on a substantially concurrent basis and,
before entering into discussions with such an offeror, the NetSilicon board
determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisor, that the offer is reasonably likely to be more favorable to
NetSilicon's stockholders than the merger with Digi and that financing, to the
extent required, is committed or, in the good faith judgment of NetSilicon's
board, is reasonably capable of being obtained by the offeror. We sometimes
refer to a third-party acquisition offer that meets this requirement as a
"superior acquisition proposal."

     NetSilicon has also agreed to advise Digi promptly of any third-party
acquisition offer or any inquiry or request for information that NetSilicon
reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a third-party acquisition
offer and the terms and conditions thereof, including the identity of the person
making the offer, request or inquiry. NetSilicon is required to keep Digi
informed in all material respects of the status and details of any third-party
acquisition offer.

     NetSilicon has also agreed not to release any party from, or waive any
provision of, any standstill agreement or any confidentiality agreement between
it and another person who has made, or who is reasonably likely to make, a
third-party acquisition offer, unless its board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the action is
necessary for it to comply with its fiduciary duties under Massachusetts law.
NetSilicon is not required to refuse a request from any person who has signed a
standstill agreement with NetSilicon to make a third-party acquisition offer to
the Chief Executive Officer or the board of directors of NetSilicon if the board
of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the action is necessary for it to comply with its fiduciary duties
under Massachusetts law.

     Employee Benefit Arrangements.  Digi has agreed that, following the
consummation of the merger, for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting,
and entitlement to vacation and severance benefits for employees actively
employed full time by NetSilicon or its subsidiaries before the merger, all
active NetSilicon employees employed full time by Digi or its subsidiaries after
the merger will receive credit for all pre-merger service with NetSilicon or any
subsidiary under any compensation, severance, welfare, pension, benefit, or
savings plan of the surviving company, Digi, or any of its subsidiaries.

     Indemnification and Insurance.  Digi has agreed that all rights to
indemnification, expense advancements, and exculpation existing in favor of
present or former directors, officers, or employees of NetSilicon or any of its
subsidiaries under the charter, bylaws, or similar organizational documents of
NetSilicon or any of its subsidiaries or by law as in effect on the date of the
merger agreement will continue in effect for a period of at least six years
after the effective time of the merger. Digi has also agreed, for at least six
years following the merger, to cause the surviving company to maintain in effect
either:

     - the current policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
       maintained by NetSilicon with respect to claims arising from facts or
       events that occurred at or before the merger; or

     - a run-off policy or endorsement with respect to the current policy
       maintained by NetSilicon for claims asserted within six years after the
       merger arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
       merger.

     However, if the amount of the insurance coverage required to maintain the
current NetSilicon policy exceeds 200% of the amount currently expended by
NetSilicon for that insurance coverage, Digi is required to maintain or provide
only the most advantageous policies obtainable for an annual premium equal to no
more than 200% of the amount currently expended by NetSilicon for that insurance
coverage. In each case, the policy will name as insureds all present and former
directors and officers of NetSilicon or its subsidiaries.

     Satisfaction of Conditions to the Merger; Notification.  Each of us has
agreed to use our reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to complete the merger, including using
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions precedent set forth under
"-- Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" below to be satisfied.

     Listing of Digi Common Stock.  Digi is required to prepare and submit a
listing application with respect to the shares of Digi common stock to be issued
in connection with the merger and to use reasonable efforts to obtain approval
for the listing of those shares of Digi common stock on the Nasdaq National
Market System.

     Governance.  Digi has agreed that, at the closing of the merger, it will
appoint Cornelius Peterson, VIII as a member of the board of directors of Digi.

EXPENSES

     Whether or not the merger is completed, NetSilicon and Digi will each pay
its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and
the merger, except:

     - expenses (excluding legal, accounting, and other advisors' fees and
       expenses) incurred in connection with the filing and printing of the
       registration statement and the mailing of this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus will be shared equally by NetSilicon and Digi; and

     - as otherwise provided in the merger agreement, including the termination
       provisions described below.

CONDITIONS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

     We are required to complete the merger only if the following conditions are
met:

     - NetSilicon stockholders have approved the merger agreement and the merger
       and Digi stockholders have approved the issuance of Digi common stock in
       the merger;

     - the registration statement, of which this joint proxy
       statement/prospectus is a part, is effective under the Securities Act;

     - the shares of Digi common stock to be issued in the merger are authorized
       for listing on Nasdaq National Market System, subject to official notice
       of issuance;

     - all waiting periods, if any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act have expired
       or been terminated and all material foreign antitrust approvals have been
       obtained;

     - there is no pending litigation or administrative proceeding by any
       governmental, regulatory or administrative entity requesting an
       injunction, writ, order, judgment, or decree that is reasonably likely to
       result in an order that restrains or prohibits the completion of the
       merger or would have a material adverse effect on the combined company if
       the merger is completed; and

     - there is no injunction, writ, order, judgment, or decree directing that
       any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement not be
       completed.

     The conditions described above may be waived by both Digi and NetSilicon
together, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

     In addition, the obligations of each party to effect the merger is subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the following additional conditions:

     - the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the
       merger agreement are true and correct in all material respects both as of
       the date of the merger agreement and immediately before the merger as if
       made on the date of the merger;

     - all obligations and agreements required to be performed and complied with
       by the other party on or before the date of the merger have been
       performed and complied with in all material respects;

     - neither the other party nor any of its subsidiaries having, since the
       date of the merger agreement, suffered any business interruption, damage
       or destruction of its properties, or other event that would be reasonably
       likely to have a material adverse effect on that party and its
       subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and

     - each party receives an opinion of counsel to the effect that the merger
       will be treated as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes.

     These conditions may be waived by either Digi or NetSilicon, as applicable.

     It is also a condition of Digi's obligation to effect the merger that no
rights have become exercisable under NetSilicon's rights agreement. This
condition may be waived by Digi.

     For purposes of the merger agreement, a material adverse effect means, with
respect to NetSilicon or Digi, as applicable, a material adverse effect upon the
business, operations, properties, or financial condition of that party and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, or on that party's ability to complete the
merger, other than any such effect resulting from (1) any change, event,
occurrence, or condition generally applicable to the industry in which the party
and its subsidiaries operate, (2) general economic or market conditions, or (3)
the public announcement of the merger agreement.

TERMINATION

     We may agree in writing to terminate the merger agreement at any time
without completing the merger, even after the stockholders of both companies
have approved it. In addition, either of us may terminate the merger agreement
if:

     - the merger has not been completed by March 15, 2002, provided that the
       failure to complete the merger is not due to the terminating party's
       failure to comply in all material respects with its obligations under the
       merger agreement;

     - any of the conditions set forth above in the first paragraph of the
       section entitled "-- Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" become
       impossible to fulfill on or before March 15, 2002, provided that the
       condition has not been waived pursuant to the merger agreement and that
       the failure to fulfill the condition is not due to the terminating
       party's failure to comply in all material respects with its obligations
       under the merger agreement;

     - any of the conditions set forth above in the third paragraph of the
       section entitled "-- Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" become,
       with respect to the other party, impossible to fulfill on or before March
       15, 2002, provided that the condition has not been waived pursuant to the
       merger agreement and that the failure to fulfill the condition is not due
       to the terminating party's failure to comply in all material respects
       with its obligations under the merger agreement;

     - the stockholders of either party fail to approve the merger-related
       proposal on which they are voting; or

     - the other company's board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies
       its recommendation that its stockholders vote in favor of the proposal
       required to complete the merger.

     NetSilicon may terminate the merger agreement if, at any time before the
NetSilicon special stockholders meeting, the board of directors of NetSilicon
approves a transaction other than the merger that it determines is a superior
acquisition proposal. However, before terminating the agreement:

     - NetSilicon must have complied with the provisions of the merger agreement
       relating to not soliciting alternative proposals to acquire NetSilicon
       discussed under "-- Additional Agreements -- No Solicitation," above; and

     - NetSilicon must have provided Digi with five business days' prior notice
       of its intention to enter into an alternative transaction, during which
       time Digi may make any adjustments to the terms and conditions of the
       merger agreement as would enable NetSilicon to proceed with the merger.

     The notice of termination will not be effective if Digi submits to
NetSilicon, within this five-day period, a legally binding offer to enter into
an amendment to the merger agreement within the five-day period unless the
NetSilicon board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its advisors, that Digi's proposed amendment is not as favorable to NetSilicon's
stockholders as the alternative transaction.

     Termination Fee and Expenses.  NetSilicon has agreed that it will pay Digi
a $2.5 million termination fee and reimburse up to $750,000 of Digi's
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement if:

     - Digi terminates the agreement as a result of the NetSilicon board of
       directors having withdrawn or adversely modified its recommendation of
       approval of the merger agreement and the merger;

     - NetSilicon terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into an
       alternative transaction under the circumstances described in the third
       paragraph under "-- Termination," above; or

     - if the following conditions occur:

      - an alternative transaction is proposed to NetSilicon and becomes
        publicly known before the termination of the merger agreement,

      - either party terminates the merger agreement as a result of the merger
        not having been completed by March 15, 2002, or the stockholders of
        either party having failed to approve merger agreement and the merger,
        and

      - within 12 months after termination, NetSilicon completes an alternative
        transaction with a third-party.

     A third-party acquisition is defined in the merger agreement as:

     - a transaction in which any third party acquires at least 40% of the
       outstanding shares of NetSilicon common stock, either by tender offer,
       exchange offer, or otherwise;

     - a merger or other business combination in which stockholders other than
       stockholders of NetSilicon own at least 40% of the surviving entity
       immediately after the merger; or

     - any transaction in which a third party acquires assets of NetSilicon
       having a fair market value equal to at least 40% of all of the assets of
       NetSilicon and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

AMENDMENTS

     We may amend the merger agreement at any time before the merger. However,
after the NetSilicon stockholders meeting, the amount and form of consideration
to be received by NetSilicon stockholders may not be decreased or altered from
that provided in the merger agreement without the approval of the NetSilicon
stockholders.

                             THE VOTING AGREEMENTS

     The following is a summary of the material provisions of the voting
agreements. The complete text of the voting agreements is incorporated by

statement/prospectus. We encourage you to read the voting agreements in their
entirety.

     As an inducement to NetSilicon to enter into the merger agreement, each of
the nine directors and executive officers of Digi have entered into a voting
agreement with NetSilicon under which they have agreed to vote all of the shares
of Digi common stock owned by them in favor of the issuance of Digi common stock
in connection with the merger. These Digi stockholders own a total of 87,682
shares of Digi common stock, representing less than one percent of the Digi
common stock outstanding as of           , 200 .

     In addition, as an inducement to Digi to enter into the merger agreement,
seven NetSilicon stockholders, each a director or executive officer of
NetSilicon, have entered into a voting agreement with Digi under which they have
agreed to vote all of the shares of NetSilicon voting common stock owned by them
in favor of the merger agreement and the merger. These NetSilicon stockholders
own a total of 100,531 shares of NetSilicon voting common stock, representing
approximately 1.4% of the NetSilicon voting common stock outstanding as of
          , 200 .

     Each of these stockholders has agreed that, during the term of the voting
agreement, at each meeting of his company's stockholders convened to consider
and vote upon the merger-related proposals, the stockholder will vote, to the
extent not voted by the person or persons appointed under the proxy granted
pursuant to the voting agreement, all shares of common stock of the company
owned of record by the stockholder at the record date in favor of the
merger-related proposals. These stockholders have also agreed not to transfer or
encumber any of the shares owned by them unless they give the other company
prior written notice and the intended transferee agrees in writing to be bound
by the voting agreement.

     Pursuant to the voting agreements, each of the stockholders granted an
irrevocable proxy to certain executive officers of the other company, the power
to vote, at any time before the termination of the voting agreement, all shares
of common stock owned by the stockholder in accordance with the voting
agreement.

                           THE STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT

agreement. The complete text of the stockholder agreement is incorporated by

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Digi entered into
a stockholder agreement with Sorrento Networks Corporation, holder of all of the
outstanding shares of NetSilicon's non-voting common stock and NetSilicon's
largest stockholder. In that agreement, Sorrento Networks has agreed to the
following terms, among others:

     - Sorrento Networks will not seek any alternative offer for an acquisition
       of NetSilicon by anyone other than Digi;

     - Sorrento Networks will not exercise any statutory appraisal rights to
       which it may be entitled under applicable law;

     - Sorrento will elect to receive the maximum amount of cash available to it
       under the merger agreement;

     - following consummation of the merger, Sorrento Networks will not acquire
       any additional shares of Digi common stock and will not seek to change
       Digi's board of directors; and

     - Sorrento will be subject to the following limitations on its ability to
       sell the shares of Digi common stock that it receives in the merger:

      - for the first six months following the merger, Sorrento may sell in any
        three-month period a number of shares not to exceed two percent of
        Digi's total outstanding shares of common stock;

      - after the initial six-month period, it may sell in any three-month
        period a number of shares not to exceed three percent of Digi's total
        outstanding shares of common stock;

      - at any time, Sorrento may sell shares pursuant to block trades, so long
        as the buyer meets certain standards; and

      - after the initial six-month period, so long as Sorrento holds at least
        five percent of Digi's outstanding common stock, Sorrento may require
        Digi to prepare and file a registration statement for Sorrento's resale
        of some or all of its shares.

Sorrento's post-closing agreements and restrictions will terminate once it holds
less than five percent of Digi's outstanding common stock.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

     The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements and related notes of NetSilicon are unaudited. In the opinion of
NetSilicon management, the pro forma financial statements include all
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of NetSilicon's results of
operations for the periods presented. These financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes
included in NetSilicon's Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2001.

     In accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, unaudited combined financial statements may omit or condense certain
information and disclosures normally required for a complete set of financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
However, management of NetSilicon believes that the notes to the combined
financial statements contain disclosures adequate to make the information
presented not misleading.

2.  PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION AND ACQUISITION COSTS

     On February 16, 2001, NetSilicon purchased all of the equity securities of
Dimatech. Prior to the acquisition, Dimatech was a major distributor of
NetSilicon's product in Japan. On August 31, 2000, NetSilicon purchased the
strategic network technology assets of Pacific. The purchased assets, which
represented substantially all of the assets of Pacific, were acquired pursuant
to an asset purchase agreement.

     The purchase prices have been allocated to the tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair
values on the acquisition date. The following represents the purchase price
allocation.

Cash........................................................  $  762,000
Accounts receivable.........................................   1,110,000
Other tangible assets.......................................     266,000
Customer list...............................................     351,000
Completed technology........................................   2,417,000
Workforce...................................................     377,000
Goodwill....................................................     134,000
                                                              ----------
  Total purchase price......................................  $5,417,000
                                                              ==========

     The combined purchase prices consisted of 332,000 shares of the common
stock of NetSilicon valued at $3,511,000 based on the average NetSilicon stock
price during a period of five business days before and after the respective
acquisition dates, $250,000 of cash and assumed liabilities of approximately
$969,000. NetSilicon incurred approximately $687,000 of costs associated with
the acquisition, including fees for investment banking, legal, accounting and
consulting services. These unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements do not reflect the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Board No. 141, "Business Combinations," and No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets."

3.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     The following pro forma adjustments have been made to the historical
financial statements of NetSilicon, Dimatech, and Pacific based upon assumptions
made by NetSilicon management for the purpose of preparing the unaudited pro
forma combined condensed statements of operations.

          (a)  To eliminate the effect of sales made by NetSilicon to Dimatech.

          (b)  To eliminate the effect of commissions paid by NetSilicon to
     Dimatech.

          (c)  To record amortization expense for acquired intangible assets of
     both Dimatech and Pacific.

          (d)  To record NetSilicon common shares issued in connection with the
     acquisitions of Dimatech and Pacific.

          (e)  To reduce common equivalent shares attributable to NetSilicon
     stock benefit plans because their effect was anti-dilutive to the pro forma
     combined results of operations.

4.  PRO FORMA EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the historical period plus the effect of
shares issued in connection with the acquisitions of Dimatech and Pacific.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the historical period plus shares issued in
connection with the acquisitions of Dimatech and Pacific and the effect of
dilutive potential common shares which consist of shares issuable under stock
benefit plans.

                                      DIGI
          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     On October 30, 2001, Digi announced its proposed acquisition of NetSilicon.
The acquisition of NetSilicon is subject to the approval of the stockholders of
Digi and NetSilicon. The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet as of June 30, 2001, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2000, and unaudited pro
forma combined condensed statement of operations for the nine-month period ended
June 30, 2001, give effect to the acquisition of NetSilicon as if it had
occurred on June 30, 2001 for purposes of the balance sheet, as of October 1,
1999 for purposes of the statement of operations for the year ended September
30, 2000, and as of October 1, 2000 for purposes of the statement of operations
for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2001. The unaudited pro forma
information is based on the historical financial statements of Digi and
NetSilicon, giving effect to the acquisition of NetSilicon by Digi as well as
the acquisitions of Dimatech and Pacific by NetSilicon, as described in the
preceding pro forma financial statements on pages   through   of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, under the purchase method of accounting and the
adjustments as described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial statements. The pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet and the pro forma combined condensed statements of operations and
accompanying notes are qualified in their entirety and should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements of Digi and NetSilicon.

     The pro forma adjustments are based on estimates and assumptions available
at the time of the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus that Digi and
NetSilicon believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The fair value of the
consideration will be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based
upon the fair values of such assets and liabilities at the effective date of the
acquisition. The estimates and assumptions will be adjusted, among other things,
based upon an independent third-party appraiser's determination of the fair
value of acquired intangible assets.

     Digi has a fiscal year end of September 30 while NetSilicon has a fiscal
year end of January 31. As a result, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
balance sheet includes unaudited balance sheet information of both Digi and
NetSilicon as of June 30, 2001. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2000 includes
NetSilicon's unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2000. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed statement of operations for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2001
includes unaudited statement of operations information of Digi and unaudited pro
forma combined condensed statement of operations information of NetSilicon for
the nine months ended June 30, 2001.

     Statement of operations information for Digi for the nine-month period
ended June 30, 2001 has been retroactively restated to reflect the adoption of
Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB
101). Digi adopted SAB 101 during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001. However, the effects of SAB 101 must be reflected
retroactively to October 1, 2000 (the first day of fiscal year 2001).

     The pro forma combined condensed financial information has been prepared in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The pro forma combined condensed financial information is intended
for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the future
financial position or future results of operations of the consolidated company
after the acquisition, or of the financial position or results of operations of
the consolidated company that would have actually occurred had the acquisition
been effected as of the dates indicated above.

      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements of Digi
have been prepared on the basis of assumptions relating to the allocation of
consideration paid to the acquired assets and liabilities of NetSilicon based on
management's best preliminary estimates. The actual allocation of the amount of
the consideration may differ from that reflected in these unaudited pro forma
combined condensed financial statements after a third party valuation and other
procedures have been completed. Below are tables of the estimated acquisition
costs and estimated purchase price allocation for NetSilicon:

Cash and fair value of Digi's common stock and common stock
  options issued............................................   $55,148,000
Direct acquisition costs....................................     1,500,000
                                                               -----------
     Total purchase price...................................   $56,648,000
                                                               ===========
Estimated fair value of net tangible assets acquired........   $13,261,000
Unearned stock compensation related to unvested portion of
  stock options issued......................................       110,000
Estimated fair value of:
  Acquired in-process research and development..............     2,500,000
  Identifiable intangible assets, net of deferred tax
     liabilities of $7,176,000..............................    11,224,000
Goodwill and assembled workforce............................    29,553,000
                                                               -----------
                                                               $56,648,000
                                                               ===========

2.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

     (a)  Adjustment reflects the components of the purchase consideration and
related transaction costs, which includes $15,000,000 in cash, Digi's common
stock with a market value of $33,158,000 and replacement stock options issued by
Digi to certain NetSilicon common stock option holders with an estimated fair
value of $6,990,000. The cash and Digi's common stock were issued in exchange
for outstanding shares of NetSilicon's common stock and Digi's common stock
options were issued in exchange for certain outstanding NetSilicon common stock
options. The value of the Digi common stock was based on a per share value of
approximately $5.27, calculated as the average market price of Digi's common
stock during the five business days immediately preceding and subsequent to the
date the parties reached agreement on terms and announced the proposed
acquisition. The value of Digi's common stock options is based on the estimated
fair value of these options, as of the date the transaction was announced, using
the Black-Scholes valuation model. Unearned compensation of $110,000 has been
recorded related to the intrinsic value of the unvested replacement common stock
options for which future services are required to vest in the replacement
portion of options.

     (b)  These amounts represent adjustments to increase the carrying values of
inventories and reduce the carrying values of intangible and other assets to
their estimated fair values.

     (c)  Digi is utilizing the alternative income valuation approach to
determine the estimated fair value of the purchased in-process research and
development. Management estimates that $2,500,000 of the purchase price
represents the fair value of purchased in-process research and development that
has not yet reached technological feasibility and will have no alternative
future uses as of the acquisition date. This amount has been expensed as a
non-recurring, non tax-deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition.
This amount is subject to adjustment following completion of the valuation to be
prepared by an independent appraiser.

     (d)  Goodwill (including assembled workforce) and intangible asset
adjustments represent the consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net
tangible assets acquired. The identifiable intangible assets included in the
estimated purchase price allocation set forth in Note 1 is comprised principally
of proven technology, customer maintenance contracts, license agreements,
patents, trademark, and customer

relationships with an estimated fair value of $18,400,000, and with estimated
useful lives ranging from three to ten years. The remaining unallocated portion
of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of tangible net assets
represents goodwill and assembled workforce. Goodwill and assembled workforce
are not amortized in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Board No. 141, "Business Combinations," and No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Digi has not yet adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets". The estimated fair value of intangible assets and goodwill is subject
to adjustment following completion of the valuation to be prepared by an
independent appraiser.

     (e)  Adjustments reflect the elimination of the existing stockholders'
equity of NetSilicon.

     (f)  Amount represents accrual for the following items:

Digi's direct acquisition costs.............................   $1,500,000
NetSilicon's acquisition related costs......................    2,500,000
Compensation payable to certain members of NetSilicon
  management upon change in control.........................    2,580,000
                                                               ----------
     Total..................................................   $6,580,000
                                                               ==========

     (g)  Amount represents the deferred tax liabilities generated as a result
of the acquisition of identifiable intangible assets assuming a blended U.S.
federal and state statutory income tax rate of 39%.

     (h)  Adjustment represents amortization of acquired identifiable
intangibles of NetSilicon based on estimated lives ranging from three to ten
years. In addition, the amortization of unearned stock compensation (as the
stock options vest) of $55,000 and $41,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000
and the nine-month period ended June 30, 2001, respectively, is included in this
adjustment. The amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles will differ
when the purchase price allocation is finalized based on the completion of the
independent third party valuation and other procedures. Goodwill amortization is
not recorded in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Board No. 141, "Business Combinations," and No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."

     (i)  Adjustments represent interest income assumed to be foregone at a
weighted-average rate of 4% due to the cash paid for the acquisition of
NetSilicon.

     (j)  Adjustments to income tax provision relating to intangible asset
amortization and adjustment (i) assuming a blended U.S. federal and state
statutory income tax rate of 39%. In addition, the utilization of NetSilicon
operating losses in the Digi consolidated income tax provision is reflected in
this adjustment.

     (k)  Adjustment relates to the following items:

     - To reflect the increase in weighted average basic shares and weighted
       average dilutive shares outstanding for the common stock and common stock
       options issued in connection with the acquisition. Pro forma basic
       earnings per common share for the periods presented were calculated
       assuming that 6,295,000 shares of Digi common stock issued in connection
       with the acquisition were issued at the beginning of the periods
       presented.

     - For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2001, pro forma diluted earnings
       per common share excludes 23,000 shares of Digi historical common
       equivalent shares because their effect was antidilutive on a combined
       pro-forma basis.

     - Common equivalent shares attributable to the common stock options issued
       by Digi in connection with the acquisition, to replace existing
       NetSilicon common stock options (2,900,000 Digi common stock options),
       were excluded in determining the weighted average dilutive shares
       outstanding for the year ended September 30, 2000 and the nine-month
       period ended June 30, 2001, because their effect was antidilutive.

     NetSilicon was incorporated in Massachusetts in April, 1984 under the name
of Digital Products, Inc. In September 1996, Sorrento Networks Corporation,
formerly Osicom Technologies, Inc., acquired sole ownership of the NetSilicon
through a merger with a newly formed corporation in exchange for Sorrento common
stock in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. NetSilicon was a
wholly owned subsidiary of Sorrento from the date of the acquisition through
NetSilicon's initial public offering on September 15, 1999.

                       DESCRIPTION OF DIGI CAPITAL STOCK

     The authorized capital stock of Digi consists of 60 million shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of which                shares were
outstanding on                , 200  , and 2 million shares of preferred stock,
par value $.01 per share, none of which is outstanding.

COMMON STOCK

     Each holder of Digi common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all
matters voted upon by Digi's stockholders. Common stockholders have no
preemptive or other rights to subscribe for additional shares or other
securities of Digi. There are no cumulative voting rights, and, accordingly,
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Digi common stock will be
able to elect all of the members of Digi's board of directors.

     Common stockholders are entitled to dividends in any amounts as may be
declared by Digi's board of directors from time to time from funds legally
available therefor, but Digi has no present intention of paying any dividends.
In the event of a liquidation, the common stockholders are entitled to share
ratably in any of Digi's assets remaining after payment in full of creditors and
preferred stockholders to the extent of any liquidation preferences.

     The outstanding shares of Digi common stock are validly issued, fully paid,
and nonassessable.

PREFERRED STOCK

     Digi's board of directors is authorized, pursuant to Digi's restated
certificate of incorporation, to issue one or more series of preferred stock
with respect to which the board, without stockholder approval, may determine
voting, conversion and other rights which could adversely affect the rights of
holders of common stock. The rights of the holders of the common stock would
generally be subject to the prior rights of the preferred stock with respect to
dividends, liquidation preferences and other matters. Among other things,
preferred stock could be issued by Digi to raise capital or to finance
acquisitions. The issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could
have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of Digi. Digi has
no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

SHARE RIGHTS PLAN

     Under the rights agreement dated as of June 10, 1998 between Digi and Wells
Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A. (formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A.), as
amended by an amendment dated as of January 26, 1999, each share of Digi common
stock has attached one preferred-share purchase right. Each right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from Digi one one-hundredth of a Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Share, $.01 per share par value, at a price of $115 per
one one-hundredth of a preferred share, subject to adjustment.

     Until the distribution date, as described below:

     - the rights will be evidenced by common stock certificates and will be
       transferred with, and only with, the shares of common stock,

     - new common stock certificates issued after the record date upon transfer
       or new issuance of shares of common stock will contain a notation
       incorporating the rights agreement by reference, and

     - the surrender for transfer of any common stock certificate, even without
       the notation or a copy of the summary of rights attached to the
       certificate, will also constitute the transfer of the rights associated
       with the shares of common stock represented by the certificate.

     As promptly as practicable following the distribution date, separate
certificates evidencing the rights will be mailed to holders of record of the
shares of common stock as of the close of business on the distribution date and
the separate rights certificates alone will evidence the rights.

     The rights will separate from the shares of common stock and a distribution
date for the rights will occur upon the earlier of:

     - the close of business on the fifteenth day following a public
       announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
       has become an "acquiring person" -- i.e., has become, subject to certain
       exceptions, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the outstanding shares
       of common stock, or

     - the close of business on the fifteenth day following the commencement or
       public announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation
       of which would result in a person or group of affiliated or associated
       persons becoming, subject to certain exceptions, the beneficial owner of
       20% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, or any later date
       as may be determined by the board of directors prior to a person or group
       of affiliated or associated persons becoming an acquiring person.

     The rights are not exercisable until the distribution date. The rights will
expire on June 30, 2008, unless extended or earlier redeemed or exchanged by
Digi as described below.

     If any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an
acquiring person, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a right,
other than rights that are or were beneficially owned by the acquiring person,
which will thereafter be void, will thereafter have the right to receive upon
exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the right that number of
shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of
the right, subject to certain possible adjustments.

     If after the distribution date or within 15 days prior thereto, Digi is
acquired in certain mergers or other business combination transactions, other
than a transaction for at least the same per-share consideration with a person
who acquired shares of common stock through a tender offer or exchange offer for
all outstanding shares of common stock approved by the board of directors in
accordance with the preceding paragraph or any wholly owned subsidiary of the
person, or 50% or more of the assets or earning power of Digi and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are sold after the distribution date or within
15 days prior thereto, in one or a series of related transactions, each holder
of a right, other than rights which have become void under the terms of the
rights agreement, will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise of
the right at the then current exercise price, that number of common shares of
the acquiring company or, in certain cases, one of its affiliates, having a
market value of two times the exercise price of the right.

     At any time prior to the close of business on the twentieth day after a
public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
has become an acquiring person, the board of directors may redeem the rights in
whole, but not in part, at a price of $.001 per right, subject to adjustment,
payable in cash; provided, however, that any redemption may occur after any
person becomes an acquiring person only if there has not been a change in
control of the board of directors. The period of time during which the rights
may be redeemed may be extended by the board of directors if no change of
control has occurred or if no person has become an acquiring person. The
redemption of the rights may be made effective at the time, on the basis and
with the conditions that the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may
establish.

     The terms of the rights may be amended by the board of directors, subject
to certain limitations after the distribution date, without the consent of the
holders of the rights, including an amendment prior to the date a person or
group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an acquiring person to lower
the 20% threshold for exercisability of the rights to not less that the greater
of:

     - the sum of .001% and the largest percentage of the outstanding shares of
       common stock then known by Digi to be beneficially owned by any person or
       group of affiliated or associated persons, subject to certain exceptions,
       or

     - 10%.

     Until a right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder
of Digi, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive
dividends.

CERTAIN CHARTER AND BY-LAW PROVISIONS

     Digi's restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
by-laws contain certain provisions, described below, that could delay, defer or
prevent a change in control of Digi if the board determines that a change in
control is not in the best interests of Digi and its stockholders, and could
have the effect of making it more difficult to acquire Digi or remove incumbent
management.

     Classified Board.  Pursuant to the restated certificate of incorporation,
directors of Digi are divided into three classes and elected to serve staggered
three-year terms. Under Delaware law, directors serving staggered terms can be
removed from office only for cause.

     Action by Written Consent.  Digi's restated certificate of incorporation
provides that all stockholder action by written consent must be unanimous.

     Special Meetings of Stockholders.  Special meetings of stockholders may be
called for any purpose by the chairman of the board of directors or the
president of Digi, and must be called by either of those officers upon the
written request of a majority of the board or a duly authorized committee of the
board. Stockholders do not have the power to call a special meeting.

     Nomination Procedures.  The amended and restated by-laws establish
procedures, including advance-notice procedures, with regard to the nomination,
other than by or at the direction of the board of

directors, of candidates for election as directors. In general, notice must be
received by Digi not less than 60 days prior to meetings of stockholders of
Digi.

     Vacancies.  A vacancy on the board of directors occurring for any reason,
including vacancies due to removal for cause, death, resignation or a newly
created directorship, may be filled for the remainder of the term by the
stockholders or by the board by vote of a majority of the remaining directors,
though less than a quorum.

     Amendment of By-Laws.  Digi's restated certificate of incorporation gives
the board of directors of Digi the power to adopt, amend, and repeal Digi's
amended and restated by-laws. This authority gives the board of directors
flexibility by enabling it to amend the amended and restated by-laws in response
to changed circumstances without waiting for the next annual meeting of
stockholders or incurring the delay and expense associated with calling and
holding a special meeting of stockholders. Stockholders of Digi have the power
to adopt, amend, or repeal the amended and restated by-laws of Digi, but only
with the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the outstanding voting stock.

     Limitations of Liability.  Digi's restated certificate of incorporation
limits the liability of directors, in their capacity as directors, to the full
extent permitted by Delaware law. It provides that directors shall not be liable
to Digi and its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of their
fiduciary duty, except:

     - for any breach to the director's duty of loyalty to Digi or its
       stockholders,

     - for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
       misconduct or a knowing violation of the law,

     - for dividends, stock repurchases, and other distributions made in
       violation of Delaware law, and

     - for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
       benefit.

     These provisions do not affect the availability of equitable remedies, such
as an action to enjoin or rescind a transaction involving a breach of fiduciary
duty, although, as a practical matter, equitable relief may not be available.
The above provisions also may not limit director liability for violations of, or
relieve them from the necessity of complying with, federal securities laws.

     Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates.  Generally, the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Digi's voting
stock entitled to vote on the merger is necessary to authorize any agreement for
consolidation, merger, or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all
of Digi's assets. However, Digi's restated certificate of incorporation provides
that if any transactions involve a beneficial holder of 20% or more of Digi's
outstanding voting stock or a liquidation or dissolution of Digi proposed by a
substantial stockholder, or in the case of certain other specified transactions
involving a substantial stockholder, whether or not they otherwise require a
stockholder vote, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the
outstanding shares of voting stock of Digi is required to authorize the
transactions. The special voting requirements do not apply if the transaction is
first approved by a majority of the directors, other than the 20% stockholder or
related parties, who were members of the board of directors prior to the time
that the substantial stockholder acquired his or her stock holdings, or whose
election or nomination for election to the board was approved by a majority of
the directors, or if the consideration required to be paid in the transaction
meets certain fair price criteria and is either cash or the same type of
consideration used by the substantial stockholder in acquiring beneficial
ownership of its largest portion of Digi's capital stock. A vote of at least 80%
of the outstanding shares of Digi's voting stock is required to amend this
special voting provision. Other amendments to Digi's restated certificate of
incorporation require an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.

     The requirement of a supermajority vote to approve certain corporate
transactions and certain amendments to Digi's restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated by-laws could enable a minority of Digi's
stockholders to exercise veto powers over any transactions and amendments.

TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR

     The Transfer Agent and Registrar for the common stock of Digi is Wells
Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A.

                                APPRAISAL RIGHTS

DIGI STOCKHOLDERS

     Under Delaware law, Digi's stockholders will not have any appraisal rights
in connection with the merger.

NETSILICON STOCKHOLDERS

     If the merger becomes effective, a stockholder of NetSilicon who does not
vote in favor of the merger and who follows the procedures prescribed under the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Law ("MBCL") may require NetSilicon to pay
the fair value, determined as provided under the MBCL, for the dissenting shares
held by the stockholder. The following is a summary of Sections 85 through 98 of
the MBCL, which sets forth the procedures for NetSilicon stockholders to object
to the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger and demand
statutory appraisal rights. The full text of Sections 85 through 98 is attached
as Annex G to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to follow those
provisions exactly could result in the loss of your appraisal rights. You should
also refer to "The Merger -- Federal Income Tax Consequences" on page      for a
discussion of the tax consequences of exercising appraisal rights.

     NetSilicon stockholders who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must
satisfy each of the applicable conditions of Sections 85 through 98. A written
objection to the proposed merger agreement stating that the stockholder intends
to demand payment for his shares must be filed with NetSilicon before the vote
on the proposal relating to the merger agreement is taken. This written demand
for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy vote abstaining
from or voting against the merger agreement. Voting against, abstaining from
voting, or failing to vote with respect to the merger agreement alone will not
constitute a demand for appraisal for purposes of Massachusetts law. NetSilicon
stockholders electing to exercise their appraisal rights must not vote for
approval of the merger agreement. If a stockholder returns a signed proxy but
does not specify a vote against approval of the merger agreement or a direction
to abstain, the proxy will be voted "FOR" the merger agreement, which will have
the effect of waiving that stockholder's appraisal rights.

     A demand for appraisal must reasonably inform NetSilicon of the identity of
the NetSilicon stockholder and that the NetSilicon stockholder intends to demand
the appraisal of his shares. Accordingly, a demand for appraisal must be
executed by or for the NetSilicon stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as
that stockholder's name appears on the certificate evidencing the dissenting
shares. If the dissenting shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity,
such as by a trustee, guardian, or custodian, the demand must be executed by or
for the fiduciary. If the dissenting shares are owned of record by or for more
than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be
executed by or for all joint owners. An authorizing agent, including an agent
for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a
stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner and
expressly disclose the fact that, in exercising the demand, he is acting as
agent for the record owner.

     A NetSilicon stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights should
deliver his written demand to NetSilicon, Inc., 411 Waverley Oaks Road, Bldg.
227, Waltham, MA 02452, Attn: Chief Financial Officer, prior to the vote
concerning approval of the merger agreement and the merger taken at the special
meeting. The written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder's name
and mailing address, that the NetSilicon stockholder objects to the proposal
regarding the merger agreement and the merger, and that he is demanding
appraisal of his shares of NetSilicon common stock.

     Within 10 days after the merger becomes effective, NetSilicon must notify
by registered or certified mail each stockholder who has satisfied the
requirements for demanding appraisal that the merger has become effective. The
notice from NetSilicon will not create any rights in its recipient to demand
payment for his shares of NetSilicon common stock.

     If, within 20 days after the date NetSilicon mails the notice, any
stockholder to whom NetSilicon was required to give notice demands in writing
payment from NetSilicon for his shares of NetSilicon common stock, NetSilicon
shall pay to such objecting stockholder the fair value of his NetSilicon common
stock within 30 days after the expiration of the period during which such demand
may be made. These written demands may be filed with NetSilicon c/o Digi
International Inc., 11001 Bren Road East, Minnetonka, MN 55343, Attn: Chief
Financial Officer. If during this 30-day period NetSilicon and the objecting
stockholder are unable to agree as to the value of the NetSilicon common stock,
either party may, within four months after the expiration of the 30-day period,
demand a determination of the value of the shares of NetSilicon common stock of
all such objecting stockholders by filing a bill in equity in the superior court
in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

     Any objecting stockholder who decides to file a bill in equity must do so
on his own behalf and on behalf of all other objecting stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom NetSilicon has not reached an
agreement as to the value thereof. Service of the bill must be made upon
NetSilicon by subpoena with a copy of the bill attached. NetSilicon will file
with its answer a duly verified list of all other objecting stockholders and the
objecting stockholders will then be deemed to have been added as parties to the
bill. NetSilicon will then give notice in the form, and returnable on the date,
ordered by the court to each objecting stockholder by registered or certified
mail to the last known address as shown in the records of NetSilicon and by
publication or otherwise as the court may order.

     After a hearing, the court shall enter a decree determining the fair value
of the NetSilicon common stock owned by the objecting stockholders who have
become entitled to the valuation of and payment for their shares and shall order
NetSilicon to make payment, together with interest, if any, to the objecting
stockholders entitled thereto upon the transfer by them of the certificates
representing their shares of NetSilicon common stock to NetSilicon if
certificated, or if uncertificated, upon receipt of an instruction to transfer
such stock to NetSilicon. The value of such shares shall be determined as of the
day preceding the date of the stockholder vote approving the merger agreement
and shall be exclusive of any element of value arising from the expectation or
accomplishment of the merger.

     The costs associated with the bill in equity, exclusive of fees of counsel
and experts retained by any party, shall be taxed upon the parties to the bill
as the court deems equitable. All costs associated with giving notice to
stockholders, however, shall be borne by NetSilicon. Interest shall be paid on
any award from the date of the vote approving the merger agreement and the
merger and the court may, upon application of any interested party, determine
the amount of interest to be paid.

     Any objecting stockholder who has demanded payment for his NetSilicon
common stock shall not thereafter be entitled to notice of any stockholders
meeting, to vote such stock for any purpose, or to receive any dividends or
distributions on the stock (except dividends or distributions payable to
stockholders of record as of a date prior to the date of the vote approving the
merger agreement) unless:

     - a bill in equity to determine the fair value of the NetSilicon common
       stock is not filed within the statutory time period;

     - a bill in equity, if filed, has been dismissed as to that stockholder; or

     - that stockholder has, with the written approval of NetSilicon, delivered
       a written withdrawal of his objections and an acceptance of such
       corporate action.

The enforcement by an objecting stockholder of his right to receive payment for
his shares in this manner shall be an exclusive remedy, except that the
stockholder may still bring or maintain an appropriate proceeding to obtain
relief on the ground that the corporate action giving rise to such right will be
or is illegal or fraudulent as to him.

                        COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

     At the time the merger becomes effective, the stockholders of NetSilicon
who do not perfect and exercise their statutory appraisal rights will become
stockholders of Digi. As stockholders of Digi, their rights will be governed by
the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and Digi's restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, which differ in certain respects
from NetSilicon's articles of organization and bylaws.

     The following is a summary of the material differences between the rights
of the holders of Digi common stock and NetSilicon common stock. You might
regard as important other differences that we do not include here. You should
refer to the documents and statutory sections we mention in this section if you
want more information.

     The following summary does not purport to be a complete statement of the
rights of Digi's stockholders as compared with the rights of NetSilicon's
stockholders. Further, the following summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the specific provisions referred to in this section. In addition,
the identification of specific differences is not meant to indicate that other
equally or more significant differences do not exist. This summary is qualified
in its entirety by reference to Massachusetts and Delaware law, and the
governing corporate instruments of Digi and NetSilicon to which stockholders are
referred.

AUTHORIZED CAPITAL

     NetSilicon's authorized capital stock consists of 35 million shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, consisting of voting common stock and
non-voting common stock, and 5 million shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of which 100,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, none of which, as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, is issued and outstanding. At           ,
200               there were           shares of NetSilicon voting common stock
outstanding and           shares of NetSilicon non-voting common stock, of which
no shares were held in the treasury. Holders of NetSilicon voting common stock
are entitled to one vote for each share and to receive such dividends as may
from time to time be declared by the NetSilicon Board out of funds legally
available for this purpose. Upon dissolution of NetSilicon or any distribution
of its assets, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Law ("MBCL"), the holders of NetSilicon
common stock are entitled to all assets of NetSilicon available for distribution
to stockholders after the satisfaction of all known creditors' claims against
NetSilicon and payment to any preferred stockholders to the extent of any
liquidation preference. The holders of NetSilicon common stock have no
preemptive rights to purchase shares of NetSilicon. The authorized capital stock
of Digi is set forth under "Description of Digi Capital Stock" on page     .

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

     On September 12, 2000, the NetSilicon Board adopted a shareholder rights
plan under which common stock purchase rights were distributed as a rights
dividend on September 23, 2000 at the rate of one right for each share of
NetSilicon common stock held as of the close of business on that date. The
rights plan is designed to prevent an acquiror from gaining control of
NetSilicon without offering a fair price to all of NetSilicon's stockholders.
The rights plan was not adopted by the NetSilicon board in response to any
specific offer or threat, but rather was intended to protect the interests of
stockholders if NetSilicon was confronted with hostile takeover activities in
the future.

     The NetSilicon board has amended the rights plan to make it inapplicable to
the merger.

     Digi also has a share rights plan, a description of which is included under
"Description of Digi Capital Stock -- Share Rights Plan" on page      .

INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

     Section 145 of the DGCL generally permits indemnification of officers,
directors, employees and agents of a Delaware corporation against expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with a derivative action and
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlements incurred in connection with a third-party action provided that
the person seeking indemnification acted in good faith and in a manner
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
corporation (and, with respect to any third-party criminal action or proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe this conduct was unlawful). Indemnification
under Section 145 is not exclusive of any other rights to which those persons
seeking indemnification may be entitled.

     Massachusetts law similarly permits indemnification of directors, officers,
employees and agents of a corporation, except that no indemnification can be
provided for any person for any matter as to which he shall have been
adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his
action was in the best interests of the corporation or, to the extent that such
matter relates to service with respect to any employee benefit plan, in the best
interests of the participants or beneficiaries of such benefit plan.
Indemnification permitted by statute does not limit any rights of
indemnification existing independently of the statute.

     Delaware law requires indemnification when the individual being indemnified
has successfully defended the action on the merits or otherwise. Massachusetts
law merely permits indemnification to the extent authorized in the corporation's
articles of organization or its bylaws or as set forth in a vote of
stockholders.

     Expenses incurred by an indemnified person in defending an action may be
paid in advance under Delaware and Massachusetts law if the person undertakes to
repay those amounts should it be determined ultimately that he or she is not
entitled to indemnification. In addition, both Delaware and Massachusetts law
permit a corporation to purchase indemnity insurance for the benefit of its
officers, directors, employees and agents whether or not the corporation would
have the power to indemnify against the liability covered by the policy.

     Both Delaware and Massachusetts corporations may include in their corporate
charters a provision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director in
certain circumstances to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for a breach of certain fiduciary duties as a director regardless of any
provision of law imposing that liability. Both the NetSilicon articles and the
Digi restated certificate include those provisions. In addition, the Digi
amended and restated by-laws require the indemnification of officers and
directors to the maximum extent permissible under Delaware law. See "The
Merger -- Interests of Directors and Executive Officers of NetSilicon in the
Merger" on page      for a description of indemnification of directors and
officers of NetSilicon to be in effect following the time the merger becomes
effective.

INSPECTION RIGHTS

     Inspection rights under Delaware law are more extensive than under
Massachusetts law. Under Delaware law, stockholders, upon the demonstration of a
proper purpose, have the right to inspect a corporation's stock ledger,
stockholder lists and other books and records. Under Massachusetts law, a
corporation's stockholders have a right to inspect only the corporation's
charter, bylaws, records of all meetings of incorporators and stockholders and
transfer records.

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     The NetSilicon bylaws provide that a special meeting of stockholders of
NetSilicon may be called by the holders of shares entitled to cast not less than
two-thirds of the votes at the meeting. Digi's amended and restated by-laws
state that a special meeting of the stockholders may only be called by the
chairman, the board of directors, a board committee, or the president. The DGCL
permits special meetings of stockholders to be called by the board of directors
or as stated in the corporation's bylaws.

     Under Delaware law, unless directors are elected by written consent, an
annual meeting of stockholders must be held as directed in the bylaws. A meeting
may be ordered by the Court of Chancery, upon application of any stockholder or
director, if an annual meeting is not held within 30 days after the date
designated in the bylaws; or no date has been designated for a period of 13
months after either the last annual meeting or the last action by written
consent to elect directors in lieu of an annual meeting, whichever is later.
Under Massachusetts law, the time and place of an annual meeting of stockholders
will be fixed as directed in the corporation's bylaws.

ACTION BY CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS

     Under Massachusetts law, any action to be taken by stockholders may be
taken without a meeting only if all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter
consent to the action in writing, and a corporation may not provide otherwise in
its charter documents or bylaws. Under Delaware law, unless the certificate of
incorporation provides otherwise, any action to be taken by the stockholders may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if the
stockholders having the number of votes that would be necessary to take such
action at a meeting at which all of the stockholders were present and voted
consent to the action in writing. The Digi restated certificate, however, states
that stockholder action without a meeting can only be taken with the unanimous
consent of all stockholders entitled to vote on the action.

PROXIES

     Massachusetts law permits the authorization by a stockholder to vote by
proxy to be valid for no more than six months. Delaware law permits a proxy to
be valid for up to three years unless the proxy provides for a longer period.

APPROVAL OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ASSET SALES

     Generally, under Massachusetts law, the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
the shares outstanding and entitled to vote of each class of stock or which
would be adversely affected by a merger or asset sale is necessary to approve a
merger or a sale of all or substantially all of the corporation's assets unless
the articles of organization provide for a lesser proportion of each class
entitled to vote, but not less than a majority. The NetSilicon articles do not
provide for a lesser proportion, so the approval of any such merger or sale,
including the merger, requires the vote of two-thirds of the shares of each
class outstanding and entitled to vote. Under Delaware law, the affirmative vote
of only a majority of the shares of stock outstanding and entitled to vote is
necessary to approve a merger or asset sale. Digi's restated certificate,
however, requires a higher vote for such transactions with certain affiliates.
See "Description of Digi Capital Stock -- Certain Charter and By-Law
Provisions."

ANTI-TAKEOVER LEGISLATION

     Under Section 203 of the DGCL, certain "business combinations" with
"interested stockholders" of Delaware corporations are subject to a three-year
moratorium unless specified conditions are met. Massachusetts law contains an
analogous anti-takeover law set forth in Chapter 110F of the General Laws of
Massachusetts. Chapter 110F does not apply to the merger because the NetSilicon
board has approved the merger agreement and merger.

     The MBCL contains another anti-takeover law, Chapter 110D of the
Massachusetts General Laws, relating to control share acquisitions. In general,
the statute provides that any stockholder who acquires 20% or more of the
outstanding voting stock of a corporation subject to this statute may not vote
any stock of the corporation acquired within 90 days of triggering the 20%
threshold, including the stock acquired in the transaction that crossed the
threshold, unless the stockholders of the corporation so authorize. In addition,
Chapter 110D permits the corporation to provide in its articles of organization
or bylaws that the corporation may redeem (for fair value) all the shares
thereafter acquired in a control share acquisition if voting rights for those
shares were not authorized by the stockholders or if no control share
acquisition

statement was delivered. NetSilicon's bylaws include a provision opting out of
the provisions of Chapter 110D, as permitted under Massachusetts law.

     Section 50A of the MBCL requires, in general, that publicly held
Massachusetts corporations have a classified board of directors consisting of
three classes as nearly equal in size as possible. Once a corporation is subject
to the classified board provisions of this statute, directors may be removed by
a majority vote of the stockholders only for cause.

     NetSilicon has a classified board of directors consisting of three classes.
At each year's annual meeting of stockholders, one of the classes of directors
of the NetSilicon board of directors is elected to serve for a three year term
unless the director is removed or resigns. Digi also has a classified board of
directors consisting of three classes. At each year's annual meeting of
stockholders, one of the classes of directors of the Digi board of directors is
elected to serve for a three-year term unless the director is removed or
resigns.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Massachusetts law, dissenting stockholders who follow prescribed
statutory procedures are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with any
merger or sale of substantially all the assets of a corporation and in
connection with certain mergers, reclassifications and other transactions which
may adversely affect the rights or preferences of stockholders.

     Delaware provides similar rights in the case of a merger or consolidation
of a corporation except that such rights are not provided as to shares of a
corporation listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a national
market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the NASD or held of
record by more than 2,000 stockholders where such stockholders are required to
accept in such a merger only (i) shares of the surviving or resulting
corporation, (ii) shares of a corporation listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders, (iii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares, or (iv) any combination thereof. Delaware law does not
provide dissenters' rights in connection with sales of substantially all of the
assets of a corporation, reclassifications of stock or other amendments to the
certificate of incorporation which adversely affect a class of stock; provided,
however, that a corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights shall be available as a result of an amendment to its
certificate of incorporation, to a merger or a sale of all or substantially all
of its assets. The Digi restated certificate does not provide for the appraisal
rights described in the preceding sentence.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Under Delaware law, a director serving on the board that is not classified
may be removed with or without cause by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. In the case of
a Delaware corporation having a classified board, stockholders may effect that
removal only for cause unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise
provides. The Digi restated certificate and amended and restated by-laws provide
for a classified board. Under Massachusetts law, any director or the entire
board of directors may be removed, except as otherwise provided in the articles
of organization or bylaws, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority
of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors, except that
directors of a class elected by a particular class of stockholders may be
removed only by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to
vote for the election of those directors. Under Massachusetts law, any director
may be removed for cause by a majority vote of the directors then in office.
NetSilicon's bylaws state that stockholders may remove a director from office
only for cause.

CHANGE IN NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

     Under Massachusetts law, the number of directors is determined in the
manner provided in the corporation's bylaws. The board of directors may be
enlarged by the stockholders or, if authorized by the bylaws as is the case for
NetSilicon, by vote of a majority of directors. The NetSilicon bylaws fix the

number of directors at not less than three, unless there are fewer than three
stockholders, in which case there can be as few directors as stockholders. Under
Delaware law, the number of directors shall be fixed by or in the manner
provided in the bylaws unless the number of directors is fixed in the
corporation's certificate of incorporation. Under the Digi amended and restated
bylaws, the board may fix the number of directors.

INTERESTED DIRECTOR TRANSACTIONS

     Delaware law provides that no transaction between a corporation and a
director or officer, or any entity in which any of them has an interest, is void
or voidable solely for this reason, solely because the director or officer is
present at or participates in the meeting of the board or committee which
authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because of his or their votes
are counted for such purpose if (i) after full disclosure the transaction is
approved by the disinterested directors, which may be less than a quorum, or the
stockholders or (ii) the transaction is fair to the corporation at the time it
is approved. Massachusetts law only expressly provides that directors who vote
for and officers who knowingly participate in loans to officers or directors are
jointly and severally liable to the corporation for any part of the loan which
is not repaid, unless (i) a majority of the directors who are not direct or
indirect recipients of such loans, or (ii) the holders of a majority of the
shares entitled to vote for such directors, have approved or ratified the loan
as one which in the judgment of such directors or stockholders, as the case may
be, may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation.

FILLING VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Under Massachusetts law, unless the articles of organization provide
otherwise, any vacancy in the board of directors, however occurring, including a
vacancy resulting from enlargement of the board and any vacancy in any other
office, may be filled in the manner prescribed in the bylaws, or, in the absence
of any such provision in the bylaws, by the directors. The NetSilicon bylaws
provide that vacancies may be filled by a majority of directors then in office.

     Under Delaware law, vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled
by a majority of directors then in office, unless otherwise provided in the
corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, provided that if at the
time of filling any vacancy or newly created directorship, the directors then in
office constitute less than a majority of the entire board as constituted
immediately prior to any increase, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, upon
application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the total
number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such
directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or
newly created directorships or to replace the directors chosen by the directors
then in office.

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

     There are no restrictions on authorized dividend payments under
Massachusetts law if these actions are taken while the corporation is solvent.
Under Delaware law, a Delaware corporation may make a distribution, subject to
restrictions and the certificate of incorporation, out of either its surplus or
if there is no surplus, its net profits for the fiscal year in which the
dividend is declared or the preceding fiscal year. All dividend payments are
subject to limitations for the benefit of preference shares. A Delaware
corporation may also repurchase shares of its capital stock if it complies with
statutory standards.

AMENDMENTS TO GOVERNING DOCUMENTS

     Under the MBCL, there are two stockholder voting thresholds for amending
the articles of incorporation. Generally, an amendment to the articles of
incorporation requires a two-thirds vote of the corporation's stockholders,
unless the corporation's articles of incorporation provide that a lesser
proportion, but no less than a majority, may amend the corporation's articles of
organization. NetSilicon's articles do not so provide for a lesser percentage
vote. Alternatively, pursuant to Section 70 of the MBCL, a majority of the
stockholders may amend the articles to increase or reduce the authorized capital
stock, change the

par value of its capital stock, change the corporation's name and effect other
changes to the corporation's capital stock.

     Under Delaware law, the certificate of incorporation of a Delaware
corporation may be amended by approval of the board of directors of a
corporation and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote for the amendment, unless a higher vote is
required by the corporation's charter. Digi's restated certificate requires the
affirmative vote of at least 80% of votes entitled to be cast to alter, amend or
repeal, or adopt any provisions inconsistent with, Article Sixth or Article
Seventh of the Digi restated certificate, which pertain to business combinations
with interested stockholders and the ability of stockholders to change the Digi
restated certificate. This special voting requirement will not apply to any
alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption recommended by Digi's board of
directors and approved by a majority of the continuing directors (as set forth
in the Digi restated certificate).

     Under the MBCL, the stockholders of the corporation generally have the
power to make, amend, or repeal bylaws unless the articles of organization also
permit the directors to make, amend or repeal bylaws in whole or in part, except
with respect to any provision of the bylaws which by law, the articles of
organization or the bylaws requires action by the stockholders. Any bylaw
adopted by the directors may be amended or repealed by the stockholders.
NetSilicon's articles and bylaws permit NetSilicon's board of directors to make,
amend or repeal its bylaws, which is permitted under the MBCL.

     Under the DGCL, a corporation's stockholders have the exclusive power to
adopt, amend, or repeal bylaws, unless the certificate of incorporation also
grants this power to the board of directors. Digi's restated certificate does
grant the board of directors the power to make, alter, or repeal its bylaws.
Digi's restated certificate also provides that the stockholders may not so adopt
or change the amended and restated bylaws except upon the affirmative vote of at
least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all the outstanding
shares entitled to vote.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

     The validity of the shares of Digi common stock to be issued in the merger
will be passed upon for Digi by Faegre & Benson LLP, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Tax
consequences of the merger will be passed upon for Digi by Faegre & Benson and
for NetSilicon by Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP, Boston, Massachusetts.

     James E. Nicholson, Secretary of Digi, is a partner of Faegre & Benson. Mr.
Nicholson holds options to purchase 70,500 shares of common stock of Digi,
63,000 of which are exercisable within 60 days of the date of this proxy

shares of Digi common stock. An attorney at Testa,

Hurwitz & Thibeault, LLP participating in matters relating to the merger
beneficially owns 6,400 shares of NetSilicon common stock.

                   STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR ANNUAL MEETINGS

     Digi.  Stockholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2003 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders must be received by Digi at its principal executive
office no later than August 23, 2002 for inclusion in the proxy statement for
that meeting. Any other stockholder proposals for Digi's 2003 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders must be received by Digi at its principal executive office not less
than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the annual meeting, unless the company
gives less than 75 days' prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting, in
which case the company must receive notice from the stockholder not later than
the close of business on the fifteenth day following the day on which the
company publicly discloses the meeting date. The notice must set forth certain
information concerning the proposal, including a brief description of the
business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for
conducting the business at the annual meeting, the name and record address of
the stockholder proposing the business, the class and number of shares of Digi
which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and any material interest of
the stockholder in the business.

     NetSilicon.  Due to the anticipated merger, NetSilicon does not currently
expect to hold a 2002 annual meeting of stockholders because NetSilicon will be
owned by Digi if the merger is completed. If the merger is not completed and an
annual meeting is later held, stockholder proposals for inclusion in the proxy
materials for that meeting would have to be submitted to the Clerk of NetSilicon
at NetSilicon's principal executive offices no later than April 17, 2002. Under
NetSilicon's bylaws, stockholders who wish to make a proposal at the next annual
meeting -- other than one that will be included in NetSilicon's proxy
materials -- must notify NetSilicon no earlier than March 18, 2002 and no later
than April 17, 2002. These proposals also must meet the other requirements of
the rules of the SEC relating to stockholder proposals. In order to curtail
controversy as to the date upon which such written notice is received by
NetSilicon, it is suggested that such notice be submitted by certified mail,
return receipt requested.

     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 30, 2001 (this
"Agreement"), among Digi International Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"),
Dove Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation formed and wholly owned by Buyer ("Buyer
Subsidiary"), and NetSilicon, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"
and, together with Buyer Subsidiary, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
"Constituent Corporations").

     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Buyer and Buyer
Subsidiary have determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
their respective shareholders to consummate, and have approved, the merger of
the Company with and into Buyer Subsidiary (the "Merger") and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS, the Company, Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection with, and to prescribe
various conditions to, the Merger.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     SECTION 1.1  The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (defined in Section 1.3), the
Company shall be merged with and into Buyer Subsidiary in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Buyer
Subsidiary shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger. Throughout this
Agreement, the term "Surviving Corporation" shall refer to Buyer Subsidiary in
its capacity as the surviving corporation in the Merger. The effects and the
consequences of the Merger shall be as set forth in Section 1.4.

     SECTION 1.2  Closing.  The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10.00 a.m. (Central Time), on the business day following the date on
which the last of the closing conditions set forth in Article VIII have been met
or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than those that by their
terms cannot be satisfied until the time of the Closing), or on such other date
or at such other time as is agreed to in writing by the parties (the date of the
Closing is referred to as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place at
the offices of Faegre & Benson LLP, 90 South Seventh Street, Minneapolis,
Minnesota 55402, or at such other location as is agreed to in writing by the
parties.

     SECTION 1.3  Effective Time of the Merger.  Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, an appropriate officer of each of the Constituent Corporations
shall execute and acknowledge (i) a duly prepared certificate of merger, which
shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Certificate of Merger") and (ii) duly prepared articles of merger, which shall
be filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts (the "Articles of Merger" and, together with the Certificate of
Merger, the "Certificates of Merger"). The Certificates of Merger shall be filed
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date (or such other date as is agreed to
in writing by the parties) following the Closing. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificates of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts in accordance with Section 252 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and Section 79 of the Massachusetts
Business Corporation Law (the "MBCL") or at such time thereafter as is agreed by
the parties and provided in the Certificates of Merger (the date and time the
Merger becomes effective is referred to as the "Effective Time").

     SECTION 1.4  Effects of the Merger.  At the Effective Time:

     (a) The Company shall be merged with and into Buyer Subsidiary, the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease, and Buyer Subsidiary
shall be the Surviving Corporation;

                                       A-5

     (b) the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of Buyer Subsidiary
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law or by the Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation; and

     (c) the Merger shall have all the effects prescribed in the DGCL and the
MBCL.

     SECTION 1.5  Directors and Officers.  As of the Effective Time, all of the
directors of Buyer Subsidiary and the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall together be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the
officers of Buyer Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until the earlier of the
resignation or removal of such person or until his or her successor is duly
elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

     SECTION 1.6  Obligations of the Surviving Corporation.  As of the Effective
Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation hereby (a) agrees that, so long as
any such liability of the Company or the Surviving Corporation remains
outstanding in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, it may be sued in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts for any prior obligation of the Company and any
obligation of the Surviving Corporation thereafter incurred, including the
obligation created by Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 156B, Section 85 so
long as such obligation remains outstanding in Massachusetts and (b) irrevocably
appoints the Secretary of the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
as its agent for service of process in any action for the enforcement of any
such obligation, including taxes, in the same manner as provided in
Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 181.

                                   ARTICLE II

          EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT
                     CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     SECTION 2.1  Manner of Converting Shares.  As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of the Constituent Corporations, the shares of capital
stock of the Constituent Corporations shall be converted or cancelled as
follows:

          (a) Buyer Subsidiary's Common Stock.  Each share of common stock of
     Buyer Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
     Time shall remain outstanding as one share of common stock of the Surviving
     Corporation and shall not be converted into any other securities or cash in
     the Merger. The certificates for such shares shall not be surrendered or in
     any way modified by reason of the Merger. No stock of Buyer Subsidiary will
     be issued in the Merger.

          (b) Conversion of Company Common Stock.  Subject to the other
     provisions of this Section 2.1, each share of common stock, par value $0.01
     per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), other than Dissenting
     Shares (as defined in Section 2.1(d)) and shares of Company Common Stock
     held of record immediately before the Effective Time by Buyer, Buyer
     Subsidiary or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer
     ("Excluded Shares"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time (collectively, the "Outstanding Shares") shall be converted
     into the right to receive from Buyer (A) an amount in cash equal to the
     Exchange Ratio (defined below) times the average per-share closing price of
     Buyer Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market System during the period
     of ten trading days ending on the third trading day before the Closing Date
     ("Buyer's Average Price"), without interest (the "Cash Consideration"), (B)
     a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
     stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer ("Buyer Common Stock"), equal to
     the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration") or (C) the right to receive
     a combination of cash and shares of Buyer Common Stock determined in
     accordance with this Section (the "Mixed Consideration"). (The Cash
     Consideration, the Stock Consideration or the Mixed Consideration, together
     with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock (the
     "Fractional Shares") to which a holder of Company Common Stock has the
     right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(e), is each referred to herein as
     the "Merger Consideration.") The "Exchange Ratio" means .6500. Election of
     the Merger Consideration

                                       A-6

     to be received upon conversion of the Outstanding Shares shall be governed
     by the following provisions:

             (i) Cash Election.  Each record holder of Outstanding Shares shall
        be entitled to elect to receive the Cash Consideration for each of such
        holder's shares of Company Common Stock (a "Cash Election"). If the
        aggregate cash payment with respect to the shares of Company Common
        Stock covered by Cash Elections (the "Cash Election Shares"), together
        with any cash payable with respect to Fractional Shares and Dissenting
        Shares, exceeds $15 million (the "Cash Election Number"), each Cash
        Election Share shall be converted into (i) the right to receive an
        amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Cash
        Consideration and (B) a fraction (the "Cash Fraction"), the numerator of
        which shall be the Cash Election Number and the denominator of which
        shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares, and (ii) a number of
        shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Exchange
        Ratio and (B) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash Fraction. Cash
        Elections shall be made on a form designed for that purpose (a "Form of
        Election"), which Form of Election shall be in such form as Buyer and
        the Company shall mutually agree. Solely for purposes of determining the
        cash payable with respect to Dissenting Shares in connection with the
        Cash Election Number, the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
        deemed to have made a Cash Election with respect to the Dissenting
        Shares.

             (ii) Stock Election.  Each record holder of Outstanding Shares
        shall be entitled to elect to receive the Stock Consideration for each
        of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock (a "Stock Election").
        Stock Elections shall be made on a Form of Election.

             (iii) Mixed Election.  Subject to the limitation on the aggregate
        amount of cash payable in the Merger set forth in Section 2.1(b)(i),
        each record holder of Outstanding Shares shall be entitled to elect to
        receive the Stock Consideration for each share of a portion of such
        holder's shares of Company Common Stock and the Cash Consideration for
        the remainder (a "Mixed Election" and, collectively with a Stock
        Election and a Cash Election, an "Election"). Mixed Elections shall be
        made on a Form of Election. With respect to each holder of Company
        Common Stock who makes a Mixed Election, the shares of Company Common
        Stock such holder elects to be converted into the right to receive Cash
        Consideration shall be treated as Cash Election Shares for purposes of
        the provisions contained in Section 2.1(b)(i), and the shares such
        holder elects to be converted into the right to receive shares of Buyer
        Common Stock shall be treated as Stock Election Shares for purposes of
        the provisions contained in Section 2.1(b)(ii).

             (iv) Form of Election.  To be effective, a Form of Election must be
        properly completed, signed and submitted to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota,
        N.A., transfer agent for Buyer Common Stock, or such other paying and
        exchange agent (which shall be a commercial bank or trust company) as
        Buyer may appoint (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company
        (the "Exchange Agent"), and accompanied by the certificates representing
        the shares of Company Common Stock ("Old Certificates") as to which the
        election is being made (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of
        such Old Certificate signed by a bank, broker, dealer, credit union,
        savings association or other entity that is a member in good standing of
        the Securities Transfer Agent's Medallion Program, the New York Stock
        Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange
        Medallion Program). A holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock
        who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another representative
        capacity (a "Holder Representative") may submit multiple Forms of
        Election, provided that such Holder Representative certifies that each
        such Form of Election covers all the shares of Company Common Stock held
        by such Holder Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Buyer
        shall have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to
        the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been
        properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard
        immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The decision of Buyer (or the
        Exchange Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither
        Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
        person of any defect in a Form of
                                       A-7

        Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. Buyer (or the Exchange Agent)
        shall make all computations contemplated by this Section 2.1, and all
        such computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of
        shares of Company Common Stock.

             (v) Deemed Non-Election.  For the purposes hereof, a holder of
        shares of Company Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election
        that is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline
        (the "No Election Shares") shall be deemed to have made a Stock
        Election. If Buyer or the Exchange Agent shall determine that any
        purported Election was not properly made, the shares subject to such
        improperly made Election shall be treated as No Election Shares.

             (vi) Election Deadline.  Buyer and the Company shall each use
        reasonable efforts to cause copies of the Form of Election to be mailed
        on the Mailing Date (as defined below) to each holder of record of
        shares of Company Common Stock as of a record date that shall be the
        same date as the record date for eligibility to vote on the Merger. The
        "Mailing Date" shall be the date on which proxy materials relating to
        the Merger are first mailed to holders of shares of Company Common
        Stock. In order to be effective, a Form of Election must be received by
        the Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the 20th
        calendar day following the Mailing Date, or such other time and date as
        Buyer and the Company may mutually agree (the "Election Deadline"). All
        elections may be revoked until the Election Deadline in writing by the
        record holders submitting Forms of Election.

          (c) Anti-Dilution Provisions.  If Buyer changes (or establishes a
     record date for changing) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued
     and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
     stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization, reclassification,
     reorganization or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer
     Common Stock and the record date therefor or the effective time thereof
     shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
     appropriately. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
     Time, Buyer shall merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation
     and the terms of that transaction shall provide that Buyer Common Stock
     shall be converted into or exchanged for the shares of any other
     corporation or entity, then provision shall be made so that shareholders of
     the Company who would be entitled to receive shares of Buyer Common Stock
     pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each
     share of Buyer Common Stock issuable to that shareholder as provided in
     this Agreement, the same kind and amount of securities or assets as shall
     be distributable upon that merger or consolidation with respect to one
     share of Buyer Common Stock. Nothing stated herein shall permit Buyer to
     take any action that is not permitted under Section 6.3 hereof without the
     written consent of the Company.

          (d) Dissenting Shares.  Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock
     the holder or beneficial owner of which has perfected such holder or
     beneficial owner's right to demand payment under Section 89 of the MBCL,
     and has not effectively withdrawn or lost that right as of the Effective
     Time (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a
     right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof shall be
     entitled only to those rights as are granted by the MBCL. If, after the
     Effective Time, a holder or beneficial owner of Dissenting Shares fails to
     perfect, withdraws or loses its right to demand payment, such Dissentin
