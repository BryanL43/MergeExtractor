                             ---------------------

Dear Shareholders:

    We are pleased to report that the Boards of Directors of BTG, Inc. and The
Titan Corporation have entered into a merger agreement which provides for the
merger of a Titan subsidiary into BTG. As a result of the proposed merger, BTG
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Titan. If we complete the proposed
merger, you will become a stockholder of Titan and receive a combination of
shares of Titan common stock and cash determined according to a formula
contained in the merger agreement in exchange for your shares of BTG common
stock. Titan's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the
trading symbol "TTN."

    AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, THE BTG BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED
AND ADOPTED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RELATED PLAN OF MERGER, THE MERGER AND THE
OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE BTG BOARD OF
DIRECTORS DETERMINED THAT THE MERGER IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF BTG
SHAREHOLDERS AND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE
MERGER AGREEMENT, THE PLAN OF MERGER AND THE PROPOSED MERGER.

    The proposed transaction is more fully described in the accompanying proxy
statement. We are asking BTG's shareholders to approve the merger agreement, the
related plan of merger and the merger at a special meeting to be held at 10:00
a.m., Eastern Time, on Tuesday, November 27, 2001 at BTG's headquarters, located
at 3877 Fairfax Ridge Road, Fairfax, Virginia. YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. We
cannot complete the proposed transaction unless holders of greater than
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock vote to approve the
merger agreement, the related plan of merger and the merger. We appreciate your
consideration in this matter.

    This proxy statement also serves as Titan's prospectus under the Securities
Act of 1933 for the issuance of Titan's common stock to you in the proposed
merger. We encourage you to read this proxy statement/prospectus carefully. IN
PARTICULAR, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE MATTERS DISCUSSED UNDER THE CAPTION "RISK

                     QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER

Q:  WHAT ARE TITAN AND BTG PROPOSING?

A:  Titan and BTG have entered into a merger agreement, pursuant to which Titan
    is offering to exchange a combination of shares of Titan common stock and
    cash for all of the outstanding shares of BTG common stock. At the
    completion of the merger, T T Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary
    of Titan, will merge with BTG. As a result of the merger, BTG will become a
    wholly owned subsidiary of Titan.

Q.  WHY ARE BTG AND TITAN PROPOSING THE MERGER?

A.  The boards of directors of BTG and Titan believe the combined strengths of
    the two companies will enable them to compete more effectively than either
    can compete alone. The merger will allow both Titan and BTG to take
    advantage of the trend toward consolidation in the government information
    technology industry in recent years. The combined company's greater
    resources will enhance its ability to effectively compete for large,
    multiple award contracts, will provide it with access to broader information
    technology and commercial customer bases and broader technology and
    expertise. To review the background and reasons for the merger in greater
    detail, see page 38.

Q:  WHAT WOULD I RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY SHARES OF BTG COMMON STOCK?

A:  In exchange for your shares of BTG common stock, you will receive a
    combination of shares of Titan common stock and cash. The number of shares
    of Titan common stock and the amount of cash that you will receive each will
    be determined on the basis of an exchange ratio based on the average of the
    closing sale prices of the Titan common stock price on the New York Stock
    Exchange for the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on the fifth
    trading day before the date of the BTG special meeting. The merger agreement
    provides that BTG shareholders will receive 81% of the merger consideration
    in shares of Titan common stock, and 19% in cash. Titan will not issue any
    fractional shares of common stock in connection with the merger. BTG
    shareholders will instead receive cash for any fractional shares otherwise
    issuable to them. For a complete description of the consideration BTG
    shareholders will receive in the merger, please see "THE MERGER--THE
    EXCHANGE RATIO."

Q:  HOW CAN I FIND OUT THE FINAL EXCHANGE RATIO?

A:  We will notify you by issuing a press release before the BTG special meeting
    of shareholders called to approve the merger agreement, the plan of merger
    and the merger announcing the final exchange ratio and filing that press
    release with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Q:  HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER?

A:  BTG and Titan are working to complete the merger as quickly as possible. We
    hope to complete the merger during the fourth quarter of 2001.

Q:  WILL I BE TAXED ON THE TITAN SHARES I RECEIVE?

A:  You will recognize taxable gain equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of
    cash you receive in the merger and (2) an amount equal to (a) the fair
    market value of the Titan common stock and cash you receive in the merger
    minus (b) your tax basis for the shares of BTG common stock you are
    exchanging in the merger. You are urged to read the information regarding
    material federal income tax consequences contained in this proxy
    statement/prospectus carefully, and to consult with your tax advisor
    regarding the consequences of the merger to you.

Q.  ARE BTG SHAREHOLDERS ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS?

A.  No. Under Virginia law, which governs BTG and the rights of its
    shareholders, BTG shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights of
    appraisal in connection with the merger.

Q.  WHO MUST APPROVE THE MERGER?

A.  In addition to the boards of directors of BTG and Titan, which have already
    approved the proposed transaction, the holders of greater than two-thirds of
    the shares of BTG common stock outstanding on the record date must approve
    the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger. The BTG special
    meeting of shareholders to approve the merger agreement, the plan of merger
    and the merger will take place on Tuesday, November 27, 2001. BTG and Titan
    must also obtain approvals under U.S. antitrust laws before the merger can
    close.

Q.  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW?

A.  You should carefully read and consider the information contained in this
    proxy statement/ prospectus. You should then complete and sign your proxy
    and return it in the enclosed return envelope as soon as possible so that
    your shares of BTG common stock will be represented at the BTG special
    meeting. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without identifying how
    you want to vote, your proxy will be voted "FOR" approval of the merger
    agreement, the plan of merger and the merger. If you do not vote in person
    or by returning your completed proxy card, your failure to vote will have
    the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the approval of the merger agreement,
    the plan of merger and the merger.

THE COMPANIES

    THE TITAN CORPORATION
    3033 Science Park Road
    San Diego, California 92121-1199
    Telephone: (858) 552-9500

    Titan is a diversified technology company that creates, builds and launches
technology-based businesses. Titan Systems, Titan's government business, is a
key provider of information technology and communications solutions, services
and products in the growing federal government information technology market.
Titan Systems also serves as Titan's engine, providing Titan with
government-funded research and development activities that generate technology
and intellectual property that often form the foundation for Titan's commercial
technology applications and new businesses as well as cash flow to fund those
businesses. Titan has developed and continues to develop new businesses, like
its SureBeam and Titan Wireless businesses, from the broad portfolio of
technologies, intellectual property and expertise that Titan has created and
continues to create as part of its work under government contracts and its
self-funded research and development program. In addition, Titan's existing
commercial businesses sometimes generate technologies that can be developed into
other new businesses.

    Titan has worked under government contracts totaling in excess of $2.0
billion in revenues since 1981. Titan's government contracts generally permit
Titan to retain intellectual property rights in

commercial applications of technologies developed under those contracts. Titan
has also supplemented its internally developed portfolio with technologies,
intellectual property and expertise through strategic acquisitions of other
government information technology companies. Titan's strategy is to leverage its
intellectual property portfolio by creating commercial technology applications
or individual businesses that can be monetized through either an initial public
offering of a subsidiary, a complete spin-off to Titan's stockholders, an
outright sale of a business, or a technology license or sale.

    Titan has organized its business into four core segments that reflect the
specific markets and industries in which it operates: Titan Systems, SureBeam,
Titan Wireless and Cayenta. In addition, Titan's Emerging Technologies and
Businesses segment develops commercial applications and businesses for
technologies created or acquired by Titan.

    TITAN SYSTEMS provides information technology and communications solutions,
services and products for defense, intelligence, and other U.S. and allied
government agencies.

    SUREBEAM provides electronic food irradiation systems and services. On
October 17, 2001, Titan announced that its board of directors had adopted a
formal plan to spin off SureBeam to Titan's stockholders through a tax-free
stock dividend. For more information, see "SUMMARY--RECENT DEVELOPMENTS--TITAN
REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SUREBEAM SPIN-OFF" on page 10 of
this proxy statement/prospectus.

    TITAN WIRELESS provides satellite-based and wireless-based communication
services and systems that provide cost-effective voice, facsimile, data,
Internet and network communications services in developing countries.

    CAYENTA is a total services provider of information technology services and
software applications for its customers' businesses and governmental functions.

    Titan's EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESSES segment currently has several
new businesses in development, including businesses in which Titan has applied
for patent protection for the underlying technology.

    Titan maintains a site on the Internet at www.titan.com; however,
information found on Titan's website is not part of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

THE MERGER (PAGE 36)

    Titan and BTG are proposing a business combination transaction in which
Titan intends to acquire all of the outstanding shares of BTG common stock,
including the associated preferred stock purchase rights. Titan intends to merge
its wholly owned subsidiary, T T Acquisition Corp., with BTG. Each share of BTG
common stock will be converted in the merger into a combination of a fraction of
a share of Titan common stock, including the associated preferred stock purchase
rights, and cash, in each case based on an exchange ratio. The exchange ratio,
and the number of shares of Titan common stock and the amount of cash that will
be paid per share of BTG stock will be determined based on the average closing
sale prices of Titan common stock over the fifteen consecutive trading days
ending on the fifth trading day prior to the date of the BTG special meeting of
shareholders called to approve the merger agreement, plan of merger and the
merger, which we refer to as the "BTG Special Meeting." The merger agreement
provides that BTG shareholders will receive 81% of the merger consideration in
shares of Titan common stock, and 19% in cash. The exchange ratio is described
in more detail in the section entitled "THE MERGER--THE EXCHANGE RATIO"
beginning on page 37 of this proxy statement/ prospectus.

    Titan will not issue any fractional shares of common stock in connection
with the merger. BTG shareholders will instead receive cash for any fractional
shares otherwise issuable to them.

MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION (PAGE 12)

    Titan common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
"TTN" and BTG common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol "BTGI." On September 19, 2001, the last full trading day before the
public announcement of the merger, the closing sale price per share of Titan
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape was $18.11 and the
closing sale

price per share of BTG common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was $10.80. On
October 24, 2001, the most recent practicable date prior to the filing of this
proxy statement/prospectus, the closing sale price per share of Titan common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape was $26.30 and the closing
sale price per share of BTG common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was
$13.10.

EXCHANGE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES (PAGE 54)

    You will receive a letter of transmittal that will provide you with
instructions on how to exchange your BTG stock certificates for the cash and
stock certificates representing the Titan common stock you receive in the
merger.

    PLEASE DO NOT SEND YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES AT THIS TIME.

SPECIAL MEETING OF BTG SHAREHOLDERS (PAGE 33)

    Under Virginia law, BTG shareholders must vote to approve the merger
agreement, the plan of merger and the merger in order for BTG to complete the
proposed transaction.

    The special meeting of BTG shareholders will be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern
Time, on Tuesday, November 27, 2001 at BTG's headquarters, located at 3877
Fairfax Ridge Road, Fairfax, Virginia 22030. At the special meeting, you will be
asked to vote to approve the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the
merger.

    You may vote, or submit a proxy to vote, at the special meeting if you were
a record holder of BTG common stock at the close of business on October 5, 2001,
which is the record date for the special meeting. If you return your proxy, you
may revoke it at any time before the vote at the special meeting by sending a
later-dated proxy or a written notice revoking the proxy to the secretary of BTG
or by attending the meeting and voting in person.

VOTE REQUIRED (PAGE 33)

    Holders of greater than two-thirds of the shares of BTG common stock issued
and outstanding on October 5, 2001 must vote to approve the merger agreement,
the plan of merger and the merger. If you do not vote your shares of BTG voting
common stock, the effect will be the same as a vote against the approval of the
merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger.

    Directors and officers of BTG beneficially owning approximately 23.1% of the
outstanding shares of BTG common stock as of September 18, 2001, have signed an
agreement to vote their shares in favor of the proposed transaction. For more
information about the terms of this voting agreement, please see the section of
this proxy statement/prospectus entitled "THE VOTING AGREEMENT" on page 69.

BTG'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER (PAGE 41)

    In the course of reaching its decision to enter into the merger agreement,
BTG's board of directors consulted with its senior management, outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, reviewed a significant amount of information and
considered a number of factors, including the following:

    - that by combining complementary operations, the combined company would
      have better opportunities for future growth;

    - the opportunity for BTG's shareholders to participate in a larger, more
      diversified organization and to benefit from the potential appreciation in
      the value of Titan's common stock;

    - information concerning the business, earnings, operations, competitive
      position and prospects of BTG and Titan both individually and on a
      combined basis;

    - the opportunity for BTG shareholders to receive a significant premium over
      the existing market price for shares of BTG's common stock prior to the
      announcement of the merger;

    - the review of, and discussions with, BTG senior management and legal
      advisors regarding certain business, financial, legal and accounting
      aspects of the merger, the results of the legal and financial due
      diligence and a review of the terms and conditions to the merger;

    - the opinion of BTG's financial advisor that, as of September 19, 2001, and
      subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth in the fairness
      opinion, the consideration to be received by BTG shareholders was fair,
      from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares
      of BTG's common stock and the financial presentation made by BTG's
      financial advisor to the board of directors of BTG in connection with the
      delivery of its opinion;

    - the possibility, as alternatives to the merger, of seeking to acquire
      another company, seeking to engage in one or more joint ventures, seeking
      to raise additional capital, or seeking to engage in a business
      combination with an organization other than Titan;

    - the likely impact of the merger on BTG's employees and customers; and

    - BTG's prospects as a stand-alone company, the uncertainties facing BTG,
      the outlook for its current strategies and the prospects for achieving
      maximum long-term value on a stand-alone basis.

    See the section entitled "THE MERGER--BTG'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER" on
page 41 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

RECOMMENDATION TO BTG SHAREHOLDERS (PAGE 33)

    BTG's board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger is in
the best interests of BTG and approved and adopted the merger agreement, the
plan of merger, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. The BTG board of directors has unanimously determined to recommend
that BTG shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement, the plan of merger
and the merger.

OPINION OF QUARTERDECK (PAGE 43)

    BTG has received a written opinion, dated September 19, 2001, from
Quarterdeck Investment Partners, LLC, to the effect that, as of the date of the
opinion and based on and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the
consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of BTG common stock.

THE VOTING AGREEMENT (PAGE 69)

    Five of BTG's directors and officers who have beneficial ownership of
approximately 23.1% of the outstanding shares of BTG common stock as of
September 18, 2001, have agreed to vote their shares to approve the merger
agreement, the plan of merger and the merger at the BTG special meeting.

INTERESTS OF BTG'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER (PAGE 47)

    When you consider the unanimous recommendation of BTG's board of directors
that BTG shareholders approve the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the
merger, you should be aware that some BTG officers and directors may have
interests in the transaction that may be different from, or in addition to,
their interests as shareholders of BTG. See the section entitled "THE
MERGER--INTERESTS OF BTG'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER" on page 47 of
this proxy statement/prospectus.

TREATMENT OF BTG STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN RIGHTS BY TITAN
  (PAGE 57)

    Titan will assume each outstanding stock option, other than options granted
to non-employee directors of BTG under the BTG, Inc. Second Amended and Restated
Directors Stock Option Plan, at the effective time of the merger. Each assumed
option will be converted into an option to purchase shares of Titan common
stock. The number of shares subject to the assumed options and the option
exercise prices will be adjusted based on the exchange ratio. All other terms of
the options will remain unchanged. All outstanding options granted under the
Directors Stock Option Plan, to the extent not exercised before the effective
time of the merger, and that plan itself, will be terminated at the effective
time of the merger.

    At the effective time of the merger Titan will not assume any outstanding
purchase rights under BTG's Annual Leave Stock Plan, Employee Stock Purchase
Plan and Non-Employee Director Stock Purchase Plan. As a result, after the close
of business on September 30, 2001, the BTG stock purchase plans were suspended
and at the effective time of the merger all outstanding purchase rights under
BTG's stock purchase plans will be terminated.

LIMITATION ON BTG'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER ACQUISITION PROPOSALS (PAGE 60)

    BTG has agreed not to solicit, initiate, encourage or discuss any proposal
for a business combination or other similar transaction involving the
acquisition or purchase of (1) more than 20% of any class of voting securities
of BTG or any of its subsidiaries or (2) businesses or assets that account for
20% or more of BTG's consolidated net revenues, net income or assets, or the
liquidation or dissolution of BTG or any of its subsidiaries, prior to
completion of the merger unless the other party has made an unsolicited written
proposal to BTG for a transaction which BTG's board of directors believes in
good faith, after consultation with BTG's financial advisor, is reasonably
likely to be consummated and would, if consummated, be in the best interests of
BTG as compared to the merger with Titan, and a number of other conditions are
satisfied.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (PAGE 65)

    Titan and BTG can terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, including if the merger is not consummated by December 18, 2001
or, if either this proxy statement/ prospectus is reviewed by the SEC or there
is any extension of any review period under any U.S. or foreign antitrust law or
regulation, by March 18, 2002.

TERMINATION FEE (PAGE 67)

    The merger agreement requires BTG to pay Titan a termination fee equal to
$5,000,000 in cash if the merger agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances. In addition, if all of the conditions precedent to Titan's
obligations to complete the merger other than Titan's receipt of approvals from
the requisite lenders under its credit facility have been obtained, and the
merger agreement is terminated as a result of Titan's failure to secure these
required lender approvals by the close of business on the fifth business day
before the date set for the BTG special meeting, Titan will be required to pay
BTG a termination fee of $1,000,000 in cash.

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES (PAGE 49)

    Titan and BTG believe that the merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if the merger is completed
under the current terms of the merger agreement. Based on these assumptions, you
will recognize taxable gain equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of cash you
receive in the merger and (2) an amount equal to (a) the fair market value of
the Titan common stock and cash you receive in the merger minus (b) your tax
basis for the shares of BTG common stock you are exchanging in the merger.

    The above described tax treatment of the merger to BTG shareholders depends
on, among other things, some facts that will not be known before the completion
of the merger. BTG shareholders are urged to carefully read the discussion in
the section entitled "THE MERGER--MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES"
beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement/prospectus. That discussion
includes a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger in
the event that the assumptions described above are not satisfied.

    TAX MATTERS CAN BE COMPLICATED, AND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
YOU WILL DEPEND ON THE FACTS OF YOUR OWN SITUATION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN
TAX ADVISOR TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT (PAGE 51)

    Titan will account for the merger as a purchase for financial reporting
purposes.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS (PAGE 52)

    Under Virginia law, BTG shareholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in
connection with the merger.

REGULATORY APPROVALS (PAGE 51)

    Titan and BTG have determined that the filing of a notification under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act is required in connection with the
merger. Accordingly, the merger may not be completed until the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act are terminated or expire. Completion of the
merger also may be subject to compliance with a limited number of foreign
antitrust regulations. Any required notifications by any foreign jurisdiction
will be filed in due course.

DIFFERENCES IN THE RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS (PAGE 97)

    If you own BTG common stock, you will receive Titan common stock and become
a stockholder of Titan after the merger. Your rights as a Titan stockholder will
be governed by Delaware law and by Titan's certificate of incorporation, bylaws
and stockholder rights plan, rather than by Virginia law, BTG's articles of
incorporation, bylaws and shareholder rights plan. For a description of how your
rights as a Titan stockholder would differ from your rights as a BTG
shareholder, see "COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF TITAN STOCKHOLDERS AND BTG SHAREHOLDERS"
beginning on page 97.

WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION (PAGE 106)

    If you would like more information about Titan or BTG, you can find this
information in documents filed by Titan and BTG with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. These documents, and instructions on how you can obtain copies of
them, can be found on page 106.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

    On July 26, 2001, Titan sold 8,048,685 shares of its common stock in a
public offering at a price of $18.00 per share, producing aggregate proceeds to
Titan, before expenses, of approximately $137.6 million. Titan used the net
proceeds to reduce indebtedness under its credit facility.

    On September 28, 2001, Titan completed its acquisition of Datron Systems
Incorporated, a provider of radio- and satellite-based communications systems
and broadband communications products for government and commercial markets, in
a stock-for-stock transaction. Titan issued approximately 2,300,000 shares of
its common stock and assumed derivative securities exercisable for approximately
437,000 shares of Titan common stock in the acquisition of Datron. Titan will
account for the Datron acquisition as a purchase.

    TITAN REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SUREBEAM SPIN-OFF.

    On October 17, 2001, Titan issued a press release reporting its results of
operations for the third quarter of 2001. Titan reported revenues of
$274.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2001, compared to $268.4 million
for the third quarter of fiscal 2000. Reported net income from continuing
operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the
third quarter of fiscal 2001 was $3.5 million or $0.06 per share (diluted)
compared to reported net income from continuing operations of $6.6 million or
$0.10 per share (diluted) in the same period last year.

    In conjunction with the third quarter earnings release, Titan also announced
that its board of directors has adopted a formal plan to spin off SureBeam to
Titan stockholders through a tax-free stock dividend. As part of this plan,
Titan will be filing with the Internal Revenue Service an application for a
letter ruling indicating that the spin-off of SureBeam to Titan stockholders
qualifies as a tax-free distribution. Titan intends to complete the SureBeam
spin-off as soon as practical following receipt of a favorable ruling and
receipt of all third party consents and in no case later than within one year of
the announcement of the plan.

    In connection with the spin-off, Titan has agreed, subject to the consent of
its lenders, to purchase a perpetual and exclusive, non-royalty bearing license
to use SureBeam's intellectual property on all applications other than the food,
animal hides, and flowers markets in return for the following: (1) to make
available to SureBeam a $50 million line of credit, (2) to convert the current
$75 million debt owed Titan to equity in exchange for SureBeam stock, and (3) a
cash payment of $8 million.

    The terms of the credit facility, which have not been finalized, will allow
for quarterly draws, will be subject to certain financial covenants, and will
have as collateral all of SureBeam's assets.

    Although Titan intends to continue to use SureBeam as its supplier of
accelerator systems and integration services for the foreseeable future, as part
of the agreement, Titan has also committed to utilize SureBeam as its exclusive
supplier for all e-beam and x-ray accelerator systems owned and operated by
Titan or sold to a third party through at least December 31, 2003. In addition,
Titan has also committed to utilize SureBeam exclusively for all integration
services related to accelerator systems until at least December 31, 2002.

    In accordance with APB No. 30, as a result of the action taken by the Titan
board to adopt a formal plan of distribution, beginning with the third quarter
of 2001 SureBeam's financial results have been presented as a discontinued
operation on Titan's statement of operations. In addition, all current year and
prior year results have been restated to reflect this discontinuance.

    Included in Titan's reported net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2001
is a loss of $42.3 million from discontinued operations which reflects a
$6.9 million operating loss for SureBeam for the quarter and an estimated loss
of $35.4 million which includes SureBeam operating losses through September 30,
2002 and associated spin-off costs.

    HIGHLIGHTS OF TITAN BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

    TITAN SYSTEMS.  Revenues in Titan's government information technologies
subsidiary, Titan Systems, increased 8% to $228.4 million in the third quarter
of fiscal 2001 compared to $211.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2000.
Increased revenues in the third quarter resulted in part from increased demand
from intelligence community customers for Titan Systems' engineering and
technical advisory services, from the Air Force for Titan Systems' information
solutions support, and from the commencement of work on the Army's Prophet
program, which is a state of the art, mobile, ground based, electronic signal
intercept system with direction finding capabilities. In addition, the
acquisition of Datron is included in third quarter 2001 results. Titan Systems'
reported operating profit also decreased slightly to $19.0 million in the third
quarter of fiscal 2001 from $19.5 million a year ago.

    TITAN WIRELESS.  Revenues in Titan's communications subsidiary, Titan
Wireless, remained relatively flat at $21.5 million compared to $21.9 million in
the third quarter of fiscal 2000. Revenues in the third quarter of 2001 were
affected by the events of September 11, which disrupted the main interconnection
switch located in lower Manhattan for Titan Wireless' long distance business. In
addition, the September 11 events and resulting travel delays also caused a
delay in a project in the Congo originally scheduled to begin in mid-September.
Titan Wireless' reported operating profit was $3.0 million compared to
$3.1 million a year ago.

    CAYENTA.  Revenues in Titan's e-business solutions subsidiary, Cayenta, were
$14.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 compared to $20.7 million in
the third quarter of fiscal 2000. The decrease from the same period of 2000
revenues was a direct result of economic conditions and weakness in the market
for commercial information technology services and e-business software
applications. Cayenta's reported operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal
2001 was $3.3 million compared to a loss of $3.0 million during the comparable
period a year ago.

    EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES.  Four businesses currently comprise the revenues in
the Emerging Technologies segment. These businesses are Titan's digitized
fingerprint scanner business (ImagClear), Titan's business that builds Internet
portals and provides integration services primarily for the financial services
industry (AverCom), Titan's wireless networking chipset business (LinCom
Wireless), and Titan's medical product sterilization business (Titan Scan).

    Revenues in Titan's Emerging Technologies and Businesses segment decreased
to $10.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 from $14.2 million in the
third quarter of fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of significantly decreased
revenue in AverCom, which specializes in providing information technology
services to the financial services industry. Revenues for AverCom in the third
quarter of 2001 were affected primarily by weaker economic conditions in the
financial services industry.

    Reported operating profit in the Emerging Technologies and Businesses
segment was $0.2 million compared to a profit of $1.6 million a year ago. The
decrease was largely a result of the decline in AverCom's business.

                           COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

    The following table shows (1) the pro forma net income and book value per
share of Titan common stock after giving effect to the recent acquisition of
Datron as if it occured on January 1, 2000 and the historical net income and
book value per share of BTG common stock in comparison with the unaudited pro
forma net income and book value per share after giving effect to the proposed
transaction as if it occured on January 1, 2000 and (2) the equivalent unaudited
pro forma net income and book value per share attributable to the shares of
Titan common stock issuable in connection with the acquisition of BTG. The
number of shares issuable has been calculated based on an assumed Titan average
closing price per share of $17.74. At this average closing price per share, the
exchange ratio would be 0.75211. Accordingly, assuming that 10,890,000 BTG
shares are exchangeable in the merger, after giving effect to the fact that 81%
of the merger consideration is to be paid in Titan common stock, Titan would
issue approximately 6,634,000 shares of its common stock in the merger.

    Please note that these numbers are estimates only. The actual exchange ratio
will not be fixed until the close of business on the fifth trading day before
the BTG special meeting of shareholders, and the actual number of Titan shares
issuable in the merger may be greater or less than these numbers. For more
information, please see the section of this proxy statement/prospectus captioned
"THE MERGER--THE EXCHANGE RATIO" on page 37.

    The following information should be read in conjunction with (1) the
separate historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Titan
and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Titan
incorporated by reference in this information statement/prospectus and (2) the
separate historical financial statements and related notes of BTG included in
this information statement/prospectus. The pro forma information is presented
for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results
of operations that would have resulted if the transaction had been completed as
of the assumed dates or of the results that will be achieved in the future.

    Neither Titan, Datron nor BTG have paid any cash dividends on their common
stock during the periods presented.

(1) Titan pro forma income information for its latest fiscal year is for the
    year ended December 31, 2000 combined with Datron's income information for
    its latest fiscal year ended March 31, 2001. BTG's income information for
    its latest fiscal year is for the year ended March 31, 2001. The pro

    forma combined data for the latest fiscal year combines Titan's pro forma
    data for the year ended December 31, 2000 with BTG's historical data for the
    year ended March 31, 2001. The pro forma combined data for the six months
    ended June 30, 2001 combines Titan with Datron and BTG's historical data for
    the six months ended June 30, 2001.

(2) The historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders'
    equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of
    each period. The pro forma book value per share is computed by dividing pro
    forma stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of common stock
    outstanding at the end of each period.

(3) The pro forma combined net loss per Titan share is computed by combining the
    net income (loss) for Titan pro forma with the effects of the recent Datron
    acquisition and BTG and any pro forma adjustments and dividing the sum by
    the pro forma weighted average number of shares of common stock and
    equivalents outstanding during the period. The pro forma shares are computed
    based upon .60921, the product of the assumed exchange ratio of .75211 in
    the merger multiplied by 81%, the portion of merger consideration that will
    be paid in Titan common stock.

(4) The amounts for equivalent pro forma combined per BTG share are calculated
    by multiplying the amounts for pro forma combined per Titan share by .60921.

                                  RISK FACTORS

    YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING MATTERS IN DECIDING WHETHER TO VOTE TO
APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE RELATED PLAN OF MERGER AND THE MERGER. YOU
SHOULD CONSIDER THESE MATTERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION THAT
TITAN HAS INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS PROXY
STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS.

RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

THE SHARES OF TITAN COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED BY BTG SHAREHOLDERS IN THE
MERGER MAY DECREASE IN VALUE AFTER THE EXCHANGE RATIO IS FIXED.

    At closing of the merger, BTG shareholders will receive a combination of
cash and a number of shares of Titan common stock determined on the basis of an
exchange ratio. The exchange ratio will be computed based on the average closing
sale prices for shares of Titan common stock during the fifteen consecutive
trading days ending on the fifth trading day before the date of the BTG special
meeting.

    Unless an adjustment is required to preserve the tax treatment of the merger
as described in the next paragraph, after the exchange ratio is fixed, the
amount of cash and the number of Titan shares that BTG shareholders will receive
in the merger will not change, even if the market price of Titan common stock
changes. There will be no adjustment to the exchange ratio or right to terminate
the merger agreement or the merger based solely on fluctuations in the price of
Titan common stock after the exchange ratio has been fixed. In recent years, the
stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market
fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of Titan common stock. The
market price of Titan common stock upon and after completion of the merger could
be lower than the market price on the date of the merger agreement or the
current market price. You should obtain recent market quotations of Titan common
stock before you return your proxy card or cast your vote at the BTG special
meeting.

    To preserve the tax treatment of the merger, if the aggregate value of the
cash per BTG share were to otherwise exceed 20% of the total value of the merger
consideration to be paid to BTG shareholders calculated as of the effective time
of the merger, Titan and BTG have agreed that the aggregate amount of cash
deliverable will be reduced to 19% of the total value of the merger
consideration, and the aggregate number of shares of Titan common stock
deliverable at closing will be increased to offset the reduction in cash
payable.

FAILURE TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES COULD DIMINISH THE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER.

    The successful combination of Titan and BTG will depend in part on the
retention of key personnel. There can be no assurance that Titan will be able to
retain BTG's key management, technical and marketing personnel, or that Titan
will realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.

IF TITAN AND BTG ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN INTEGRATING THEIR ORGANIZATIONS, THE
ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE MERGER MAY NOT BE REALIZED.

    If Titan and the stockholders of the combined company are to realize the
anticipated benefits of the merger, the operations of Titan and BTG must be
integrated and combined efficiently. Titan cannot assure you that the
integration will be successful or that the anticipated benefits of the merger
will be fully realized. Similarly, Titan cannot guarantee that the BTG
shareholders will achieve greater value through their ownership of Titan common
stock than they would have achieved as shareholders of BTG. The dedication of
Titan's management resources to integration activities may detract attention
from the day-to-day business of the combined company. The difficulties of
integration may be increased by the need to integrate personnel with disparate
business backgrounds and combine different corporate cultures. This integration
may also be more difficult due to Titan's integration challenges as a result of
its recently completed acquisitions or any future acquisitions. Titan cannot
assure you that

there will not be substantial costs associated with the integration process,
that integration activities will not result in a decrease in revenues or a
decrease in the value of Titan common stock, or that there will not be other
material adverse effects from Titan's integration efforts.

    In addition, after the transaction, Titan intends to develop new products
that combine BTG's assets with Titan's assets. This may result in longer product
implementations, which may cause BTG's revenue and operating income and the
revenue and operating income of Titan's businesses that are collaborating with
BTG to fluctuate and fail to meet expectations. To date, Titan has not completed
its investigation into the challenges--technological, market-driven or
otherwise--to developing and marketing these new products in a timely and
efficient way. There can be no assurance that Titan and BTG will be able to
overcome these challenges, or that a market for such new products will develop
after the merger.

SALES OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF TITAN'S COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET BY BTG
SHAREHOLDERS COULD DEPRESS TITAN'S STOCK PRICE.

    Other than shares held by affiliates of BTG or Titan, shares of Titan's
common stock that are issued to shareholders of BTG, including those shares
issued upon the exercise of options and BTG stock purchase rights, will be
freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the
Securities Act of 1933. If the merger with BTG closes and if BTG shareholders
sell substantial amounts of Titan common stock in the public market following
the transaction, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding
options to purchase Titan common stock by BTG option holders and stock purchase
rights, the market price of Titan common stock could fall. These sales might
also make it more difficult for Titan to sell equity or equity-related
securities at a time and price that it otherwise would deem appropriate. The
number of shares of Titan common stock that will be issued in the transaction
will be based on the average closing sale prices for shares of Titan common
stock during the fifteen consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading
day before the date of the BTG special meeting. Assuming a Titan average closing
price per share of $17.74, Titan would issue approximately 5,473,000 shares of
Titan common stock in the transaction. In addition, Titan will assume all
outstanding employee stock options to purchase BTG common stock, which, assuming
a Titan average closing price per share of $17.74, would be converted into
options to acquire approximately 953,000 shares of Titan common stock at the
closing of the merger.

RISKS RELATED TO TITAN'S BUSINESS

TITAN'S GROWTH DEPENDS TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE GROWTH OF ITS COMMERCIAL
BUSINESSES, SOME OF WHICH OPERATE IN NEW AND UNPROVEN MARKETS. IF ONE OR MORE OF
TITAN'S COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES FAIL TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OR ACHIEVE
ANTICIPATED REVENUE LEVELS, TITAN MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOUP ITS INVESTMENTS IN
OR ADVANCES TO THESE BUSINESSES, ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE OF MONETIZING THESE
BUSINESSES OR ACHIEVE THE OPERATING RESULTS THAT TITAN ANTICIPATES.

    Titan is committed to creating, building and launching technology-based
commercial businesses. As part of implementing this strategy, Titan has
developed the technology-based businesses known as SureBeam, Titan Wireless and
Cayenta, and is in the process of developing and commercializing the technology
applications and businesses in Titan's Emerging Technologies and Businesses
segment. If any of the primary markets targeted by SureBeam, Titan Wireless or
Cayenta fail to develop and grow as Titan anticipates, or those markets do
develop and grow as anticipated but SureBeam's, Titan Wireless's and/ or
Cayenta's principal products and services do not gain market acceptance, Titan's
revenues will be less than Titan expects and Titan may be unable to recoup the
equity investments and intercompany advances Titan has made to develop and grow
those businesses. To grow as currently contemplated, Titan will need to derive
an increasing portion of its revenues from its commercial businesses, including
the businesses in Titan's Emerging Technologies and Businesses segment. If the
markets for some or all of the businesses in Titan's Emerging Technologies and
Businesses segment fail

to develop and grow as expected, or those markets do develop and grow as
expected but those businesses' principal products and services do not meet with
market acceptance, Titan's future prospects may suffer. If any of Titan's
businesses fail to grow as Titan anticipates, it may not be able to monetize
these businesses and enable its stockholders to realize value from that process.

SUREBEAM

    SureBeam faces the challenges associated with the risks of a new enterprise
and the commercialization of a technology with an unproven market. The use of
SureBeam's electron beam technology for food irradiation and the market for
electronically irradiated food is at an early stage of development. As of June
30, 2001, six food processors were selling food electronically irradiated by
SureBeam. Other food processors are testing SureBeam's technology. Titan also
does not know whether or when any fast food or other national chain restaurants
or food retailers will decide to offer irradiated meat and create demand for
SureBeam's electronic food irradiation systems. Titan expects that some food
processors will not irradiate food unless industry leaders first commit to
distribute irradiated food. Market acceptance of SureBeam's technology will also
depend on consumer acceptance of irradiated food. Accordingly, a market for
irradiated foods has only recently begun to develop, and its continued
development will depend on broad acceptance of irradiated foods by consumers,
food producers and providers, restaurant chains and food retailers. This
consumer and market acceptance may not occur. Titan's board of directors has
adopted a plan to spin off SureBeam to Titan's stockholders through a tax-free
stock dividend. For more information see "SUMMARY--RECENT DEVELOPMENTS--TITAN
REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SUREBEAM SPIN-OFF" on page 10.

TITAN WIRELESS

    Titan Wireless's principal strategy is to provide communications services
and systems to developing countries primarily in Asia, Africa, the Middle East
and Latin America. Titan Wireless's future success will depend substantially on
the rate and the extent to which the markets for communications services and
systems develop in the developing countries that it targets. Titan cannot
guarantee that substantial markets for communications services and systems in
these developing countries will ever develop, or if those markets do develop,
that communications services based on fixed-site satellite technology, wireless
local loop technology, or global systems for mobile communications technology,
all of which Titan Wireless can provide, will capture a significant portion of
those markets. The development of a market for communications services and
systems in a particular developing country will depend upon a variety of factors
including whether that country has sufficient resources to support such a market
and whether the communications services and systems are offered at an affordable
cost to their end users so that adequate traffic can be generated. Titan
Wireless's success will also depend to a significant extent on its continued
ability to identify and enter into strategic relationships with effective local
partners to act as Titan Wireless's intermediaries with local regulators and
experts in the local market. If Titan Wireless is unable to continue to
cultivate and maintain these relationships, its overall business will suffer.

CAYENTA

    Cayenta's market is characterized by fluctuating demand for its products and
services based on overall economic conditions and their impact on government and
corporate information technology budgets as well as changes in user sentiment
toward particular technologies, technology applications and related services.
Cayenta's operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2001 were
adversely affected by a slowdown in corporate spending on commercial information
technology services and e-business software applications. Cayenta's market is
also intensely competitive. Cayenta's competitors include numerous companies
across various segments of the information technology services and software
products markets. Existing or future competitors may independently develop and
patent or

copyright technologies that are superior or substantially similar to Cayenta's
technologies. The costs to develop and to provide information technology
services are relatively low. Moreover, barriers to entry, particularly in the
areas of information technology consulting and integrating software
applications, are low. Therefore, Cayenta will likely continue to face
additional competition from new entrants into its market. If overall economic
conditions continue to weaken demand for Cayenta's products and services, or if
Cayenta is unable to anticipate and respond effectively to changing market
conditions or to compete effectively for any reason, its business will suffer.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESSES

    The businesses in Titan's Emerging Technologies and Businesses segment face
the ongoing challenges of developing technology applications that anticipate and
satisfy consumers' requirements and achieving market acceptance for those
technology applications in new and rapidly changing markets. To the extent these
businesses fail to effectively meet either of those challenges, Titan's ability
to execute its monetizing strategy and provide increased value to Titan's
stockholders will be diminished.

TITAN HAS A LIMITED HISTORY OF COMMERCIALIZING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND TITAN'S
COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES MAY NOT REMAIN OR EVER BECOME SUCCESSFUL.

    In 1991, Titan adopted a strategy of seeking to develop commercial
businesses using technology developed for government purposes in Titan's
government defense business. Titan's SureBeam and Titan Wireless businesses are
a product of this strategy. For the most part, Titan's commercial businesses are
in an early stage of development or have only recently begun to offer their
products, services, systems or solutions in the markets, including new markets,
in which they operate. These technology-based businesses are subject to risks
and uncertainties inherent in companies at these early stages of development,
including:

    - the risks that their base technology will become obsolete and that they
      will fail to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to rapid
      technological changes;

    - the risks associated with operating in markets that are subject to a high
      degree of competition;

    - the risk that they will have inadequate management resources to capitalize
      on market opportunities and execute their strategy;

    - the risk that they will be unable to manage rapid growth effectively;

    - the risk that they will be unable to execute successfully each portion of
      their business strategy on schedule;

    - the risk that Titan may not identify markets with sufficient opportunities
      to justify Titan's investments in products and solutions for these
      markets;

    - the market and operating risks that are unique to each particular
      business; and

    - the risk that adequate capital may not be available to fund their
      continued development.

    Titan balances its investment objectives for each of its businesses with
Titan's overall profitability objectives. This balancing is a basic part of
Titan's approach to creating and building new commercial businesses and creates
the possibility that any or all of Titan's businesses may not grow at the pace
or to the level that they otherwise might if they were independent companies.
These factors, including the risks identified above, could affect Titan's
ability to monetize its investments in its businesses or diminish the value that
Titan's stockholders ultimately recognize from those investments.

TITAN MAY MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR INTERCOMPANY ADVANCES TO SOME OF ITS
BUSINESSES, WHICH TITAN COULD LOSE OR HAVE TO WRITE OFF.

    Titan has historically funded businesses in its Emerging Technologies and
Businesses segment, as well as its other businesses, with equity investments
and/or intercompany advances, and expects to continue to do so in the future. At
the time Titan makes these investments or advances, these businesses are
typically at an early stage of development. If these businesses do not become
profitable or Titan is unable to monetize its investments in them, Titan could
lose all or a portion of its equity in those businesses and be required to write
off some or all of any amounts advanced.

TITAN'S COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES' GROWTH MAY BE IMPAIRED BECAUSE OF INVESTMENT OR
FUNDING CHOICES TITAN MAKES OR BECAUSE TITAN IS UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT
CASH FLOW OR TO ACCESS CAPITAL FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES.

    Titan typically funds its businesses' growth with equity investments,
intercompany advances and/or public or private financing. Titan may choose not
to fund potential growth opportunities for its businesses with equity
investments or intercompany advances based on risk considerations or Titan's
balancing of its investment objectives for those businesses with its overall
profitability objectives. In addition, Titan may be unable to fund potential
growth opportunities for its businesses to the extent that Titan Systems does
not generate sufficient cash flow for Titan to do so or Titan does not otherwise
have capital on hand and/or cannot access adequate capital. Titan may also be
precluded from funding potential growth opportunities for its commercial
businesses with public or private financing based on market conditions and/or
restrictive loan covenants. To the extent that Titan is unable to, or chooses
not to, provide capital to its commercial businesses to fund potential growth
opportunities, Titan's commercial businesses' growth could be impaired.

MARKET CONDITIONS AND LEGAL AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS MAY IMPAIR TITAN'S
ABILITY TO MONETIZE ITS INVESTMENTS IN ITS COMMERCIAL TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS
AND BUSINESSES.

    Titan cannot guarantee that it will be able to monetize any of its
investments in its commercial technology applications or businesses, whether
through an initial public offering of a subsidiary, a complete spin-off to Titan
stockholders, an outright sale of a subsidiary, or a technology license or sale.
Market or competitive conditions may be such that Titan is unable to complete
initial public offerings of its subsidiaries or spin-offs of its subsidiaries to
Titan's stockholders at valuations that Titan considers appropriate, in which
case Titan may choose to delay or forego initial public offerings or spin-offs
of these subsidiaries. Based on market or competitive conditions, Titan may also
be unable to sell or license its commercial technology applications or sell its
businesses at valuations or for other consideration Titan considers appropriate,
in which case Titan may choose to delay or forego those sales or licenses. To
the extent possible, Titan intends to structure any initial public offerings
that its subsidiaries conduct in a manner to preserve the ability to later
distribute the stock Titan retains in the subsidiaries to its stockholders on a
tax-free basis. Under current law, there are a number of tax and other legal
requirements that must be satisfied in order to successfully execute this
strategy and Titan cannot guarantee that they will be met. Contractual
restrictions may also restrict Titan's ability to successfully execute this
strategy. With the exception of SureBeam and Cayenta, Titan's credit facility
does not permit Titan's subsidiaries to conduct initial public offerings or,
with the exception of Cayenta, allow Titan to distribute the stock of its
subsidiaries to Titan stockholders without the consent of the lenders. Titan may
distribute the stock of Cayenta to Titan stockholders without the consent of the
lenders so long as Titan is in compliance with financial ratios specified in,
and not otherwise in default under, its credit facility.

TITAN DEPENDS ON GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES
AND THE LOSS OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS OR A DECLINE IN FUNDING OF EXISTING OR
FUTURE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT TITAN'S REVENUES AND CASH
FLOWS AND TITAN'S ABILITY TO FUND ITS COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES.

    Titan's revenues from U.S. government business represented approximately 85%
of Titan's total revenues in 1998, approximately 84% of Titan's total revenues
in 1999, approximately 74% of Titan's total revenues in 2000, and approximately
80% of Titan's total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2001. Titan's
U.S. government contracts are only funded on an annual basis, and the U.S.
government may cancel these contracts at any time without penalty or may change
its requirements, programs or contract budget or decline to exercise option
periods, any of which could reduce Titan's revenues and cash flows from U.S.
government contracts. Titan's revenues and cash flows from U.S. government
contracts could also be reduced by declines in U.S. defense and other federal
agency budgets.

    A significant percentage of Titan's products and services are predominantly
sold and performed under contracts with various parts of the U.S. Navy or U.S.
Air Force or with prime contractors to the U.S. Navy or U.S. Air Force. Although
these various parts of the U.S. Navy or U.S. Air Force are subject to common
budgetary pressures and other factors, Titan's various U.S. Navy and U.S. Air
Force customers exercise independent purchasing decisions. However, because of
such concentration of Titan's contracts, Titan is vulnerable to adverse changes
in its revenues and cash flows if a significant number of Titan's U.S. Navy or
U.S. Air Force contracts and subcontracts are simultaneously delayed or canceled
for budgetary or other reasons.

    In addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets, Titan
may be adversely affected by:

    - budgetary constraints affecting U.S. government spending generally, and
      changes in fiscal policy;

    - curtailment of the U.S. government's use of technology services and
      products providers;

    - the adoption of new laws or regulations;

    - technological developments;

    - U.S. government shutdowns, such as that which occurred during the U.S.
      government's 1996 fiscal year; and

    - general economic conditions.

    These or other factors could cause U.S. defense and other federal agencies
to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate
contracts or not to exercise options to renew contracts. Any of these actions or
any of the other actions described above could reduce Titan's revenues and cash
flows and impair Titan's ability to make equity investments in or intercompany
advances to its commercial subsidiaries as part of its approach to creating and
building new businesses.

GOVERNMENT AUDITS OF TITAN'S GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL
CHANGE TO TITAN'S FUTURE EARNINGS AND HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TITAN'S CASH
POSITION.

    Titan's U.S. government contracts are subject to cost audits by the
government. These audits may occur several years after completion of the audited
work. Titan could have a material charge to its future earnings or reduction in
its cash position as a result of an audit, including an audit of one of the
companies Titan has acquired. Some of Titan's acquired companies did not
historically impose internal controls as rigorous as those Titan imposes on the
government contracts it performs, which may increase the likelihood that an
audit of their government contracts could cause a charge to Titan's future
earnings or reduction in its cash position.

TITAN'S OPERATING MARGINS MAY DECLINE UNDER ITS FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS IF TITAN
FAILS TO ESTIMATE ACCURATELY THE TIME AND RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SATISFY TITAN'S
OBLIGATIONS.

    Some of Titan's contracts are fixed-price contracts under which Titan bears
the risk of any cost overruns. Titan's profits are adversely affected if its
costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions Titan used in bidding for the
contract. In 2000, approximately 32% of Titan's revenues were derived from
fixed-price contracts, and in the six months ended June 30, 2001 approximately
24% of Titan's revenues were derived from fixed-price contracts. Often, Titan is
required to fix the price for a contract before Titan finalizes the project
specifications, which increases the risk that Titan will misprice these
contracts. The complexity of many of Titan's engagements makes accurately
estimating Titan's time and resources more difficult.

IF TITAN IS NOT ABLE TO RETAIN ITS CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND
SUBCONTRACTS UNDER U.S. GOVERNMENT PRIME CONTRACTS IN THE COMPETITIVE REBIDDING
PROCESS, TITAN'S REVENUES MAY SUFFER.

    Upon expiration of a U.S. government contract or subcontract under a U.S.
government prime contract, if the government customer requires further services
of the type provided in the contract, there is frequently a competitive
rebidding process. Titan cannot guarantee that Titan, or the prime contractor,
will win any particular bid, or that Titan will be able to replace business lost
upon expiration or completion of a contract. Further, all U.S. government
contracts are subject to protest by competitors. The termination of several of
Titan's significant contracts or nonrenewal of several of Titan's significant
contracts, the imposition of fines or damages, or Titan's suspension or
debarment from bidding on additional contracts could result in significant
revenue shortfalls.

TITAN MAY BE LIABLE FOR PENALTIES UNDER A VARIETY OF PROCUREMENT RULES AND
REGULATIONS, AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
TITAN'S BUSINESS.

    Titan's defense and commercial businesses must comply with and are affected
by various government regulations. Among the most significant regulations are
the following:

    - the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations, which comprehensively regulate
      the formation, administration and performance of government contracts;

    - the U.S. Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and
      disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract
      negotiations;

    - the U.S. Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements
      that govern Titan's right to reimbursement under certain cost-based
      government contracts;

    - laws, regulations and Executive Orders restricting the use and
      dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and
      the exportation of certain products and technical data;

    - the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which regulates SureBeam's
      technology as a food additive and is administered by the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration;

    - regulations relating to using the SureBeam system, including product
      labeling, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety
      and Inspection Service and by health and environmental safety departments
      and other regulatory agencies within various states and foreign countries;
      and

    - laws and regulatory requirements relating to satellite communications and
      other wireless communication systems in the developing countries where
      Titan Wireless operates.

    These regulations affect how Titan's customers and Titan do business and, in
some instances, impose added costs on Titan's businesses. Any changes in
applicable laws could adversely affect the

financial performance of the business affected by the changed regulations. With
respect to U.S. government contracts, any failure to comply with applicable laws
could result in contract termination, price or fee reductions or suspension or
debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.

TITAN'S FAILURE TO IDENTIFY, ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED TECHNICAL AND
MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS EXISTING BUSINESSES AND ITS
ABILITY TO BUILD ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES.

    Titan cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain the highly
qualified technical personnel for each of its segments, including engineers,
computer programmers and personnel with security clearances required for
classified work, that are necessary for maintaining and growing Titan's existing
businesses or building additional commercial businesses. Titan's success also
depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of Titan's
management personnel for each of its segments. Titan's ability to build
additional commercial businesses in its Emerging Technologies and Businesses
segment will depend in part on Titan's ability to attract management personnel
from outside Titan with relevant market expertise and management skills, and on
Titan's ability to retain and motivate these managers.

TITAN COMPETES IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS AGAINST MANY COMPANIES THAT ARE
LARGER, BETTER FINANCED AND BETTER KNOWN THAN TITAN. IF TITAN IS UNABLE TO
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, TITAN'S BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

    Titan's businesses operate in highly competitive markets. Many of its
competitors are larger, better-financed and better-known companies who may
compete more effectively than Titan can. Titan's commercial businesses compete
against other technologies as well as against companies with similar products
and services. In order to remain competitive, Titan must invest to keep its
products technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to Titan's
customers. Titan's ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on
Titan's capital resources and Titan's ability to invest in maintaining and
expanding its market share.

TITAN HAS COMPLETED NUMEROUS STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND MAY COMPLETE OTHERS,
WHICH COULD INCREASE TITAN'S COSTS OR LIABILITIES OR BE DISRUPTIVE.

    Since January 1, 1998, Titan has acquired 14 government information
technology businesses as part of Titan's strategy of consolidating government
information technology businesses. In addition, since January 1, 1999, Titan has
acquired four information technology services and solutions companies as part of
Cayenta's development of its total services provider offering. Several of the
businesses that Titan acquired had themselves acquired other businesses prior to
their acquisition by Titan. The acquisition and integration of new businesses
involve risk. The integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may
result in a decrease in the value of Titan's common stock for the following
reasons, among others:

    - Titan may need to divert more management resources to integration than
      Titan planned, which may adversely affect Titan's ability to pursue other
      more profitable activities;

    - the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of
      coordinating geographically separated organizations, integrating personnel
      with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate
      cultures;

    - Titan may not eliminate as many redundant costs as Titan anticipated in
      selecting its acquisition candidates; and

    - one or more of Titan's acquisition candidates also may have liabilities or
      adverse operating issues that Titan failed to discover through its
      diligence prior to the acquisition.

    In addition to the merger, Titan intends to continue to look for strategic
acquisitions. Titan may not be able to integrate successfully any acquired
businesses without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial
problems. In addition, instability in the U.S. securities markets and volatility
in Titan's stock price may make acquisitions with Titan's stock more expensive.

TITAN MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN PROTECTING TITAN'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,
WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT TITAN'S PROFIT MARGINS. TITAN'S INABILITY TO
PROTECT ITS PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES
COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT TITAN'S BUSINESSES' PROSPECTS AND COMPETITIVE POSITIONS.

    As part of Titan's strategy, Titan seeks to protect its proprietary
technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary-right protection
in the U.S. and other countries. The laws of some foreign countries do not
protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If Titan
is unable to obtain or maintain these protections, Titan may not be able to
prevent third parties from using its proprietary rights. In addition, Titan may
incur significant expense both in protecting its intellectual property and in
defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by
others.

    Titan assesses the strength of its patent and intellectual property
protection for its technologies and products. Despite Titan's assessments and
Titan's belief in the strength of its patent protection for particular
technologies or products, Titan's patents may not provide effective barriers to
entry against competitors in the markets targeted by particular technologies and
products because Titan's competitors may develop competing technologies and
products that do not infringe upon Titan's patents. Titan also could choose to
modify or abandon one or more planned or current products because of these
assessments or actual or threatened claims by other companies. Titan is not
certain that its pending patent applications will be issued.

    Titan also relies on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing
technological innovation to remain competitive. Titan has taken measures to
protect its trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality
agreements with Titan's employees, consultants and advisors. It is possible that
these agreements may be breached and that any remedies for a breach will not be
sufficient to compensate Titan for damages incurred. Titan generally controls
and limits access to, and the distribution of, its product documentation and
other proprietary information. Titan also cannot guarantee that other parties
will not independently develop Titan's know-how or otherwise obtain access to
Titan's technology.

    On January 6, 2000, Ion Beam Applications S.A., a Belgian corporation, and
its related U.S. subsidiaries filed an action for declaratory judgment in a
federal court in Virginia against Titan and SureBeam relating to SureBeam's
patents for its SureBeam systems. On Titan's motion, the Virginia court
transferred the case to the Federal District Court in San Diego. The action
attacks the validity of SureBeam's core Irradiation System Utilizing Conveyor
Transported Article Carriers patent, and seeks a declaration that Ion Beam
Applications and its customers have not infringed any of the claims in
SureBeam's patent. On November 29, 2000, Ion Beam filed an amended complaint
alleging, in addition to the original claims, that Titan and SureBeam have
engaged in false advertising, monopolization, restraint on trade, unfair
business practices and unfair competition, and alleging unenforceability due to
patent misuse. Titan and SureBeam have filed a counterclaim against the
plaintiffs alleging infringement of SureBeam's patent for its SureBeam systems.
Titan and SureBeam are seeking damages and an injunction preventing further
infringement of SureBeam's patent. On April 17, 2001, the court granted Titan's
motion to try Titan's and SureBeam's patent infringement claim and Ion Beam
Application's claims against SureBeam's patent separately and before any trial
of Ion Beam Application's claims alleging false advertising, monopolization,
restraint on trade and unfair business practices. Titan and SureBeam intend to
vigorously enforce SureBeam's patents and prosecute their patent infringement
claims against the plaintiffs. Titan and SureBeam also intend to vigorously
defend against all allegations made by the plaintiffs. However, a finding in
favor of Ion Beam Applications in

this litigation could adversely affect SureBeam's business, financial condition
and results of operations by allowing Ion Beam and other potential competitors
to develop and commercialize electron beam food irradiation systems that would
compete against SureBeam's systems and services, thereby potentially reducing
the growth of Titan's SureBeam business segment and preventing SureBeam from
generating the revenues that it expects from food irradiation.

RISKS OF TITAN'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN
OTHER COUNTRIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF ITS TITAN WIRELESS,
SUREBEAM AND CAYENTA BUSINESSES.

    Titan's Titan Wireless, SureBeam and Cayenta businesses each operate in
international markets. Through Titan's subsidiary Titan Wireless, Titan sells
communications services and systems primarily in developing countries. Although
Titan currently sells its communications services and systems primarily in U.S.
dollars, currency devaluations and adverse market conditions in developing
countries in the past have, and in the future could, negatively affect demand
for Titan's communications services and systems and, consequently, Titan's
revenues for this segment. In addition, Titan may in the future bill for its
communications services in local currency. As a result, revenues in this segment
may be adversely affected by economic conditions in developing countries.
SureBeam also intends to increase the sales of its SureBeam systems abroad as
SureBeam obtains regulatory approvals to market and sell those systems in other
countries. Those jurisdictions may apply different criteria from the U.S.
regulatory agencies in connection with their approval processes. Monitoring
changes in, and SureBeam's compliance with, diverse and numerous foreign
regulatory requirements may increase SureBeam's costs. The possibility of such
added costs due to the complexity of maintaining compliance with varied foreign
regulatory requirements is a risk that all of Titan's businesses that operate in
international markets face. To date, Titan does not believe that the
international operations of its existing businesses currently subject it to
material risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. However, as Titan
increases the international operations of its businesses, Titan's risks from
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, to the extent Titan bills for its
products in foreign currencies, will increase.

    Selling products or services in international markets also entails other
market, economic, cultural, legal and political risks, conditions and expenses.
These risks include:

    - trade protective measures and import or export licensing requirements or
      other restrictive actions by foreign governments;

    - reduced protection of intellectual property rights;

    - political and economic instability;

    - difficulties in collecting amounts owed to Titan;

    - difficulties in managing overseas employees and contractors; and

    - changes in applicable laws and regulations, including licensing laws, tax
      laws and regulations.

    Any one of these factors or other international business risks could
adversely affect Titan's financial performance.

THE COVENANTS IN TITAN'S CREDIT FACILITY RESTRICT TITAN'S FINANCIAL AND
OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND TITAN'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THEM COULD HAVE A
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON TITAN'S BUSINESS.

    Titan's credit facility contains covenants that restrict, among other
things, Titan's ability to borrow money, make particular types of investments,
including investments in Titan's subsidiaries, or other restricted payments,
swap or sell assets, merge or consolidate, or make acquisitions. An event of
default under Titan's credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all
amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. Titan has pledged
substantially all of its consolidated assets and the stock of Titan's
subsidiaries to secure the debt under Titan's credit facility, excluding the
assets of SureBeam

and any foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts outstanding under the credit
facility were accelerated, the lenders could proceed against those consolidated
assets and the stock of Titan's subsidiaries. Any event of default, therefore,
could have a material adverse effect on Titan's business. Titan's credit
facility also requires Titan to maintain specified financial ratios. Titan's
ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond Titan's
control, and Titan cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. Titan also
may incur future debt obligations that might subject Titan to restrictive
covenants that could affect Titan's financial and operational flexibility or
subject Titan to other events of default. Any such restrictive covenants in any
future debt obligations Titan incurs could limit Titan's ability to fund its
commercial businesses with equity investments or intercompany advances, which
would impede Titan's ability to execute its approach to creating and building
new businesses.

TITAN'S OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DISRUPTIONS IN ITS SUPPLY
OF PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS OR SERVICES.

    Because Titan's internal manufacturing capacity is limited, Titan uses
contract manufacturers. While Titan uses care in selecting its manufacturers,
this arrangement gives Titan less control over the reliability of supply,
quality and price of products or components than if Titan manufactured them. In
some cases, Titan obtains products from a sole supplier or a limited group of
suppliers. For example, SureBeam relies on one supplier for some of the key
components used to manufacture SureBeam's linear accelerator. Consequently,
Titan risks disruptions in its supply of key products and components if Titan's
suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of strikes, natural disasters,
financial condition or other factors. Any material supply disruptions could
adversely affect Titan's business, financial condition and results of operations
as well as Titan's ongoing product cost structure.

TITAN'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION. COMPLIANCE
COSTS, OR ANY FUTURE VIOLATIONS OR LIABILITY UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, COULD
HARM TITAN'S BUSINESS.

    Titan is subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations governing
the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes and imposing
liability for the cleanup of contamination from these substances. Titan cannot
completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these substances
or wastes, and, in the event of such an incident, Titan could be held liable for
any damages that result. From time to time, Titan has been notified of
violations of government and environmental regulations. Titan attempts to
correct these violations promptly without any material impact on Titan's
operations. In addition, Titan may be required to incur significant additional
costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. These
costs, and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or
regulations, could have a material adverse effect on Titan's business.

RISKS RELATED TO TITAN'S COMMON STOCK

TITAN'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY FLUCTUATED AND MAY CONTINUE TO
FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET
PRICE OF ITS COMMON STOCK.

    Titan's revenues are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of
sales and contracts awards due to the long procurement process for most of its
products and services, defense and intelligence budgets, the time it takes for
the new markets Titan targets to develop and for Titan to develop and provide
products and services for those markets, competition and general economic
conditions. Titan's product mix and unit volume, its ability to keep expenses
within budgets, its distribution channels and its pricing affect its gross
margins. These factors and other risk factors described herein may adversely
affect Titan's results of operations within a period and cause Titan's financial
results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Consequently,
Titan does not believe that comparison of its results of operations from period
to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of its likely future results
of operations. It is possible that in some future quarter or quarters Titan's
operating results will

be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors. If so, the
market price of Titan's common stock may decline significantly.

MARKET PERCEPTION AND PERFORMANCE OF TITAN'S PUBLICLY TRADED SUBSIDIARY,
SUREBEAM, COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON TITAN'S STOCK PRICE.

    As the parent company of its publicly traded subsidiary, SureBeam, the
market price of Titan's common stock could be disproportionately impacted by
negative news or other publicity concerning SureBeam, including public concerns
about the safety of irradiated foods, as well as SureBeam's financial
performance and the market price of its common stock. Titan's board of directors
has adopted a formal plan to spin off SureBeam to Titan's stockholders through a
tax-free stock dividend. For more information, please see "SUMMARY--RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS--TITAN REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SUREBEAM
SPIN-OFF" on page 10 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN TITAN'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND
DELAWARE LAW, AS WELL AS TITAN'S STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN, COULD DISCOURAGE,
DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL THAT TITAN'S STOCKHOLDERS MAY FAVOR.

    Provisions in Titan's certificate of incorporation, its bylaws and Delaware
law could make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover
attempt Titan opposes even if a change in control of Titan would be beneficial
to the interests of its stockholders. These provisions could discourage
potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of
Titan's common stock. These provisions:

    - permit Titan's stockholders to take action by written consent instead of
      at a meeting and to nominate directors or bring other business before
      stockholder meetings only if they comply with advance notice and other
      procedural requirements in Titan's bylaws;

    - authorize Titan's board of directors, without stockholder approval, to
      issue up to 2,931,898 shares of "blank check" preferred stock that could
      be issued by its board of directors to increase the number of outstanding
      shares and prevent a takeover attempt; and

    - prohibit Titan from engaging in mergers and other business combinations
      with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of its voting stock,
      or with their affiliates, unless Titan's directors or stockholders approve
      the business combination in the prescribed manner.

    In addition to the provisions described above, in 1995 Titan's board of
directors adopted a "poison pill" stockholder rights plan, which may further
discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire Titan which Titan has
not solicited or does not approve, even if the acquisition would be beneficial
to Titan's stockholders. As a result, Titan's stockholders who wish to
participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. Under
Titan's rights plan, preferred share purchase rights, which are attached to
Titan's common stock, generally will be triggered upon the acquisition, or
actions that would result in the acquisition, of 15% or more of Titan's common
stock by any person or group. If triggered, these rights would entitle Titan's
stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase, for the exercise price, shares
of Titan's common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price.
In addition, if a company acquires Titan in a merger or other business
combination not approved by the board of directors, these rights will entitle
Titan's stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase, for the exercise
price, shares of the common stock of the acquiring company having a market value
of two times the exercise price.

THERE MAY BE VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF TITAN'S COMMON STOCK.

    Stock prices of many companies in the high technology industry have
experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating
performance of these companies. The market price of Titan's common stock may
vary widely as a result of several factors, including:

    - announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by
      Titan or its competitors;

    - budgetary constraints affecting U.S. government spending generally,
      changes in fiscal policy, and government regulatory initiatives;

    - patent or proprietary rights developments;

    - public concern as to the use or safety of one or more of Titan's
      technologies; and

    - general market conditions.

    These factors could lead to a significant decrease in the market price of
Titan's common stock.

                    THE SPECIAL MEETING OF BTG SHAREHOLDERS

GENERAL

    This proxy statement/prospectus, together with a notice of special meeting
and a form of proxy, is being provided to BTG shareholders in connection with
the solicitation of proxies by the BTG board of directors for use at a special
meeting of BTG shareholders to be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on Tuesday,
November 27, 2001 at BTG's headquarters, located at 3877 Fairfax Ridge Road,
Fairfax, Virginia 22030, or at any adjournment, postponement or rescheduling of
that meeting.

    This proxy statement/prospectus and the accompanying notice of special
meeting and form of proxy are first being mailed to shareholders of BTG around
October 26, 2001.

MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED

    The special meeting of shareholders is being held so BTG shareholders may
consider and vote to approve the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the
merger.

    BTG shareholders also will be asked to act on any other matters that may
properly come before the meeting.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BTG BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    The BTG board of directors has approved unanimously the merger agreement and
plan of merger, the merger and other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. The BTG board of directors believes that the merger is in the best
interests of BTG. The BTG board recommends unanimously that BTG shareholders
vote "FOR" the approval of the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the
merger.

RECORD DATE AND VOTE REQUIRED

    The BTG board of directors has fixed October 5, 2001 as the record date for
determining the BTG shareholders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at
the special meeting. Therefore, only shareholders of record at the close of
business on the record date will receive notice of, and be able to vote at, the
special meeting of BTG shareholders.

    At the close of business on the record date, there were 8,984,260 shares of
BTG common stock outstanding and entitled to a vote, held by 256 record holders.
A majority of these shares must be represented, in person or by proxy, at the
special meeting in order to constitute a quorum. A quorum must be present before
a vote can be taken on the approval of the merger agreement, the related plan of
merger and the merger, or any other matter except adjournment or postponement of
the meeting due to the absence of a quorum. Abstentions will be counted for
purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the special meeting.

    Each share of BTG common stock entitles its holder to cast one vote on each
matter submitted to a vote at the special meeting. For the proposed transaction
to be approved under Virginia law and BTG's articles of incorporation, greater
than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of BTG common stock on the record date
must be voted to approve the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the
merger. In the event that shareholders are asked to vote on a proposal to
adjourn or postpone the special meeting to permit solicitation of additional
proxies, approval of that proposal would require the affirmative vote of holders
of at least a majority of the shares of BTG common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting.

    As of September 18, 2001, directors and executive officers of BTG
beneficially owned 2,378,637 shares of BTG common stock, which represented
approximately 25.6% of the shares of BTG common stock then outstanding. Five of
these directors and executive officers of BTG, beneficially owning

approximately 23.1% of the outstanding BTG shares as of September 18, 2001, have
signed an agreement to vote their shares to approve the merger agreement, the
plan of merger and the merger. Each of these shareholders also has given Titan
an irrevocable proxy authorizing Titan to vote the shareholder's shares in favor
of the approval of the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger. See
"THE VOTING AGREEMENT" for more information about this voting agreement.

PROXIES

    This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to BTG shareholders in
connection with the solicitation of proxies by the BTG board of directors for
use at the special meeting of BTG shareholders. It is accompanied by a form of
proxy.

    BTG shareholders should complete, sign and return the form of proxy if they
will not be able to attend the special meeting in person. A shareholder who
submits a proxy and later changes his or her mind as to the vote, or decides to
attend the meeting in person, may revoke the proxy at any time before the vote
at the special meeting by (x) notifying the corporate secretary of BTG in
writing of the revocation or (y) completing, signing and returning a proxy with
a later date. In addition, a BTG shareholder may revoke a prior proxy by
attending the special meeting and voting in person. However, attendance at the
special meeting by a BTG shareholder who has signed a proxy but does not provide
a notice of revocation or request to vote in person is not sufficient to revoke
that proxy. In addition, please note that BTG shareholders who wish to vote at
the BTG special meeting must bring to the meeting a letter from their broker,
bank or other nominee if their shares are held in "street name" by one of those
record holders.

    Written notices of revocation of proxies and other communications relating
to proxies should be addressed to:

                                   BTG, Inc.
                            3877 Fairfax Ridge Road
                             Fairfax, VA 22030-7448
                              Attention: Secretary

All shares of BTG stock entitled to vote represented at the special meeting of
BTG shareholders by properly executed proxies that are received prior to or at
the meeting and not revoked before the vote at the special meeting will be voted
at the meeting as directed by the stockholders in the proxies for such shares.
If a properly executed proxy is returned but contains no voting instructions,
the shares of BTG common stock represented by the proxy will be voted "FOR"
approval of the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger. If BTG
shareholders are asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting
to permit the solicitation of additional proxies and no directions on this
proposal are indicated, proxies that indicate a vote in favor of approval of the
merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger will be voted "FOR" the
proposal to postpone or adjourn, proxies that indicate a vote against approval
of the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger will be voted
"AGAINST" the proposal to postpone or adjourn, and proxies that abstain from a
vote on approval of the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger will
be voted "FOR" the adjournment or postponement.

    APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE PLAN OF MERGER AND THE MERGER REQUIRES
THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF HOLDERS OF GREATER THAN TWO-THIRDS OF THE SHARES OF BTG
COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING ON THE RECORD DATE. ACCORDINGLY, ABSTENTIONS AND
FAILURES TO VOTE WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTES AGAINST THE MERGER
AGREEMENT, THE PLAN OF MERGER AND THE MERGER. THEREFORE, THE BTG BOARD OF
DIRECTORS URGES ALL BTG SHAREHOLDERS TO COMPLETE, DATE AND SIGN THE ACCOMPANYING
PROXY AND RETURN IT PROMPTLY IN THE PRE-ADDRESSED, POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE
PROVIDED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

    If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the special
meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will have the
discretion to vote on those matters using their best judgment.

    BTG and Titan have agreed to share equally certain costs, including costs of
printing, filing and mailing this proxy statement/prospectus and the
registration statement of which it is a part. All other expenses incurred in
connection with the solicitation of proxies will be $6,000 plus reasonable
expenses and will be borne by BTG. Following the original mailing of the proxy
statement/prospectus, proxies and other soliciting material, BTG will request
brokers, custodians, nominees and other record holders of BTG common stock to
forward copies of those materials to persons for whom they hold shares of BTG
common stock, and to request authority for the exercise of proxies. In these
cases, if the record holders so request BTG will reimburse the record holders
for their reasonable expenses. Directors, officers and employees of BTG may
solicit proxies in person or by telephone, mail, facsimile or other means. These
directors, officers and employees will not be separately compensated for
soliciting proxies.

    PLEASE DO NOT SEND STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH YOUR PROXY CARD.

AVAILABILITY OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

    Deloitte & Touche LLP acted as BTG's independent auditors for the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2001 and March 31, 2000. Representatives of Deloitte &
Touche LLP familiar with BTG are expected to attend the special meeting and to
be available to answer appropriate questions and will have an opportunity to
make a statement if they should desire to do so.

                                   THE MERGER

    The discussion in this proxy statement/prospectus of the merger and the
principal terms of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the merger agreement, which is attached to this proxy
statement/prospectus as ANNEX A, and the plan of merger, the form of which is
attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as ANNEX B. Both the merger
agreement and the plan of merger are incorporated in this document by reference.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

    On September 19, 2001, Titan entered into a merger agreement with BTG,
providing for a subsidiary of Titan to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
BTG common stock by means of a merger. BTG's board of directors unanimously
determined that the merger is in the best interests of BTG and approved the
merger agreement, the plan of merger, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. The BTG board of directors unanimously
recommends that BTG shareholders vote their shares "FOR" the approval of the
merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, T T Acquisition Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Titan, will be merged with and into BTG at the effective
time of the merger. BTG will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Titan.

    At the effective time of the merger, all issued and outstanding shares of
BTG common stock will be converted into the right to receive a combination of
shares of Titan common stock and cash calculated as described below. The number
of shares of Titan common stock and the amount of cash that BTG shareholders
will be entitled to receive will depend on the average of the closing sale
prices of the Titan common stock on the NYSE for the fifteen consecutive trading
days ending five trading days immediately before the date of the BTG special
meeting. The merger agreement provides that BTG shareholders will receive 81% of
the merger consideration in shares of Titan common stock, and 19% in cash.

    Titan will not issue fractional shares of its common stock in the merger.
Instead, any holder of BTG common stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Titan common stock by virtue of the merger will
receive cash equal to the product of the fraction of a share to which the holder
is entitled multiplied by the closing sale price of the Titan common stock on
the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately before the effective
date of the merger, rounded to the nearest whole cent.

    At the effective time of the merger, Titan will assume all outstanding BTG
stock options, other than those options granted under BTG's Directors Stock
Option Plan, which will be terminated and be of no further effect. Each assumed
option will be converted in the merger into an option to purchase shares of
Titan common stock using the same exchange ratio that is applicable to BTG
common stock in the merger, with any fractions rounded down to the nearest whole
share. The exercise price per share of Titan common stock issuable under the
assumed options will equal the exercise price per share of BTG stock issuable
under the applicable option immediately before the effective time of the merger,
divided by the exchange ratio, then rounded up to the nearest cent. Except for
the number of shares issuable and the exercise price for each assumed option,
the assumed options will remain subject to the same terms and conditions that
were in effect before the merger. The assumption of the options by Titan will
not affect the vesting of the assumed options, although BTG options that
provided for vesting upon a "change of control" will vest at the effective time
of the merger. All options granted under BTG's 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan
on or after December 17, 1998 provide for 100% vesting upon a change of control
and, accordingly, will fully vest and become exercisable at the effective time
of the merger.

    At the effective time of the merger, all outstanding BTG stock purchase
rights will be terminated and be of no further effect. Titan will not assume any
stock purchase rights of BTG in the merger.

THE EXCHANGE RATIO

    At closing of the merger, each share of BTG common stock then issued and
outstanding, other than shares held by a subsidiary of BTG or by Titan or any
subsidiary of Titan, if any, shall be converted into and shall be cancelled in
exchange for the right to receive a combination of shares of Titan common stock
and cash, each to be determined on the basis of the exchange ratio. The number
of shares of Titan common stock that will be paid per BTG share will be equal to
the exchange ratio MULTIPLIED BY 0.81. The amount of cash that will be paid per
BTG share will equal the exchange ratio, MULTIPLIED BY 0.19, MULTIPLIED BY the
average closing sale prices of the Titan common stock during the fifteen
consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately prior to
the date of the BTG special meeting.

    To preserve the tax treatment of the merger, if the aggregate value of the
cash to be paid to BTG shareholders were to otherwise exceed 20% of the total
value of the merger consideration to be paid to BTG shareholders calculated as
of the effective time of the merger, Titan and BTG have agreed that the
aggregate amount of cash deliverable will be reduced to 19% of the total value
of the merger consideration at the effective time of the merger, and the
aggregate number of shares of Titan common stock deliverable at closing will be
increased to equal 81% of such value.

    The exchange ratio will be computed based on the average closing sale prices
for shares of Titan common stock during the fifteen consecutive trading days
ending on the fifth trading day before the date of the BTG special meeting. This
average price is also referred to in this section as the "average Titan trading
price." The exchange ratio will be calculated as follows:

    - if the average Titan trading price is greater than $17.74, the exchange
      ratio will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing 13.35 by the
      average Titan trading price, computed to the fifth decimal place;

    - if the average Titan trading price is less than or equal to $17.74 and
      greater than or equal to $16.15, the exchange ratio will be 0.75211;

    - if the average Titan trading price is less than $16.15, the exchange ratio
      will be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing 12.15 by the average
      Titan trading price, computed to the fifth decimal place.

    Assuming the exchange ratio were fixed as of October 24, 2001, the last
practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the
exchange ratio would have been 0.50760, and each share of BTG common stock would
have been entitled to receive 0.41116 shares of Titan common stock and $2.54 in
cash at closing of the merger.

    Titan will notify you of the final exchange ratio before the date of the BTG
special meeting by issuing a press release announcing the final exchange ratio
and filing that press release with the SEC.

CASH INSTEAD OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF TITAN COMMON STOCK

    Titan will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of its
common stock in the merger. Instead, each former BTG shareholder who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Titan common stock by virtue of
the merger (after aggregating all fractional shares of Titan common stock that
otherwise would be received by the holder) will receive cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying:

    - that fraction of a share of Titan common stock to which such person is
      entitled by virtue of the merger (after aggregating all fractional shares
      of Titan common stock that otherwise would be received by such person), by

    - the closing sale price of one share of Titan common stock on the New York
      Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in the Wall Street
      Journal or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source) on
      the trading day immediately before the effective date of the merger.

BACKGROUND OF THE TRANSACTION

    BTG CONSIDERATION OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES.

    From time to time over the past few years, BTG's management and board of
directors have reviewed strategic alternatives, including remaining an
independent public company, the possibility of acquisitions or mergers with
other companies, the possible sale of BTG and other transactions.

    During April 2000, BTG met with representatives from Legg Mason Wood Walker,
Incorporated and Prudential Securities, Incorporated to further evaluate the
Company's strategic alternatives in light of the then current factors existing
within the government information technology services market and BTG's place
within that industry. On April 17, 2000, the board of directors by unanimous
written consent authorized the engagement of Legg Mason and Prudential to
formally advise BTG with respect to the possible sale of BTG.

    BTG entered into an engagement letter with Prudential on April 25, 2000 and
Legg Mason on April 26, 2000 to serve as BTG's exclusive investment advisors in
connection with the sale of BTG through an auction process designed to obtain
the highest possible bids for BTG. BTG, with the help of the financial advisors,
developed a confidential information memorandum, which was written to provide
potential buyers with general information regarding BTG, including its
historical and projected financial performance. Upon completion of the
memorandum, Legg Mason and Prudential started the marketing process by
contacting potential acquirers, including Titan, in May 2000.

    Although some potential acquirers expressed interest in a potential
acquisition, the indications of interest were either withdrawn or were
determined by BTG, in consultation with Prudential and Legg Mason, not to be in
BTG's interest to pursue further. In light of the market conditions and the
inability to obtain an acceptable offer, the board of directors agreed to cease
the auction process in September 2000. Subsequently, in July 2001, BTG received
an unsolicited expression of interest from Titan.

    TITAN ACQUISITION STRATEGY.

    In recent years, developments in government procurement policies and other
factors have contributed to substantial consolidation in the government
information technology industry, as larger companies have acquired smaller
companies without the broad capabilities needed to compete effectively for
government contracts. Titan has pursued a policy of supplementing the internal
growth in its defense and government information technology business with an
active program of strategic acquisitions to take advantage of growth
opportunities from this ongoing consolidation. Since January 1, 1998, Titan has
acquired fourteen government information technology companies as part of its
consolidation strategy. In implementing its strategy, Titan seeks acquisition
candidates it believes are capable of bringing strategic advantages, earnings
and strong management resources to the combined company.

    CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS LEADING TO EXECUTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

    On July 13, 2001, at the direction of the management of Titan, Michael
Alexander, a member of the board of directors of Titan, met with Dr. Bersoff,
BTG's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, to express Titan's
interest in re-initiating discussions regarding a possible combination between
Titan and BTG. Mr. Alexander and Dr. Gene Ray, Titan's Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and President, had both known Dr. Bersoff for a number of years and each
had spoken periodically by telephone and in person at business and social
occasions with Dr. Bersoff.

    From the end of July 2001 and through the beginning of August 2001,
Dr. Ray, Mr. Alexander and Eric DeMarco, Titan's Chief Operating Officer and
Executive Vice President, engaged in a number of exploratory discussions with
Dr. Bersoff regarding the trends in the defense industry and certain strategic
issues in the context of a business combination between the two companies.
During that period, Titan executed a confidentiality agreement in which it
agreed to maintain, and to cause its affiliates and representatives to maintain,
the confidentiality of the information it received from BTG in connection with
its evaluation. During the week of August 13, 2001, Dr. Ray and Dr. Bersoff
agreed to meet in Washington, D.C., to discuss certain conceptual issues
regarding a potential business combination between Titan and BTG.

    On August 17, 2001, Dr. Ray met with Dr. Bersoff and four other members of
the BTG board of directors in Washington, D.C. At this meeting, Dr. Ray provided
the BTG directors present with an extensive briefing regarding Titan and its
business. After that larger meeting concluded, Dr. Ray and Dr. Bersoff continued
their separate discussion of trends in the defense industry, certain strategic
issues in the context of a possible business combination between the two
companies and began formal discussions regarding a possible business combination
between the two companies.

    On August 19, 2001, Dr. Ray contacted Dr. Bersoff to discuss further issues
raised at the meeting in Washington, D.C. and to discuss further the potential
synergies of a business combination of the two companies.

    During the weeks of August 20, 2001 and August 27, 2001, members of senior
management of Titan and BTG, and their respective advisors, held discussions and
meetings pertaining to the terms of the proposed business combination and
general business issues, and conducted due diligence investigations. The
discussions regarding the terms of a combination transaction related principally
to agreeing upon an exchange ratio and the structure of the acquisition. Working
groups composed of employees of both companies and their independent
accountants, and financial and other advisors were formed to examine various
issues.

    On August 23, 2001, the Titan board of directors met in a regularly
scheduled meeting at which Titan's senior management advised the directors of
the status of the discussions with BTG and provided the directors with
information regarding BTG and its business. Titan management's presentation
included estimates of potential savings that could result from synergies
expected from a combination transaction and estimated effects on earnings per
Titan common share that a transaction could have at different potential exchange
ratios. Titan management also presented the terms of the proposed transaction.
The Titan board authorized senior management to proceed to negotiate the terms
of the definitive documents to acquire BTG.

    After the Titan board meeting on August 23, 2001, Titan and BTG amended
their confidentiality agreement to provide that for a period of two years, Titan
would not, without the permission of the BTG board of directors, acquire any
voting securities of BTG, form any "group" within the meaning of the Exchange
Act relating to any of BTG's voting securities or engage in the solicitation of
proxies with respect to BTG stockholders for a period of two years. BTG and
Titan also entered into an exclusivity agreement. This agreement obligated BTG,
subject to certain exceptions, to refrain from conducting any negotiations with
other persons regarding a business combination for a period of thirty days.

    During the two weeks following August 23, 2001, members of senior management
of Titan and BTG negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related
transaction documents, including the voting agreement. During this period, the
parties continued to exchange financial, business and legal due diligence
materials and conducted additional due diligence. During this time Mr. DeMarco
and Dr. Bersoff had several conversations regarding the terms of the exchange
ratio.

    On August 30, 2001, the BTG board of directors met in a special meeting at
which BTG's senior management advised the directors of the status of the
discussions with Titan and provided the directors with further information
regarding Titan, its business, and related financial data. BTG management's

presentation included estimates of the value of BTG based on different exchange
ratios, management succession issues and potential synergistic opportunities
provided by a combination transaction.

    During the week of September 4, 2001, senior management of BTG and Titan
held further discussions regarding the terms of a possible business combination,
including the appropriate exchange ratio.

    On September 4, 2001, Mr. DeMarco and Dr. Bersoff met in San Diego,
California to discuss the financial information provided and the proposals of
the two companies regarding the terms of a possible business combination,
including an appropriate exchange ratio.

    On September 6, 2001, BTG formally engaged Quarterdeck to provide a fairness
opinion regarding the fairness of the terms of the proposed transaction from a
financial point of view to the shareholders of BTG.

    On September 7, 2001, the Titan board of directors held a special meeting.
At this meeting, members of Titan's senior management, together with Titan's
legal and financial advisors, reviewed with the Titan board of directors, among
other things, the financial and legal aspects of the transaction, the proposed
exchange ratio, the terms of the merger agreement, the voting agreement, and the
other matters described below under the "THE MERGER--TITAN REASONS FOR THE
MERGER." After discussion and consideration, the Titan board of directors
unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and the issuance of
Titan common stock and the cash consideration in connection with the merger
contingent upon a specified range for the exchange ratio.

    On September 10, 2001, Dr. Bersoff contacted Mr. DeMarco to raise additional
issues regarding the terms of the exchange ratio. The parties could not come to
agreement on the terms of the exchange ratio, and work on the definitive
agreement and diligence was suspended.

    On September 11, 2001, terrorists, with the use of hijacked commercial
airplanes, attacked the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in
Washington, D.C. One of the results of the attack was the suspension of stock
trading by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Trading would not resume
until the morning of September 17th. In light of the tragedy, discussions during
this period were limited.

    After the stock markets resumed trading on September 17, 2001 through
September 19, 2001, Mr. DeMarco and Dr. Bersoff continued their discussions
regarding the terms of the business combination and the exchange ratio. The
management teams of BTG and Titan, and their legal advisors resumed diligence
and the negotiation of the definitive agreements.

    On September 19, 2001, Titan's senior management contacted certain members
of the Titan board of directors to discuss, among other things, the status of
discussions with BTG and the final exchange ratio proposed to BTG, which was
within the approved range set forth in the Titan board of directors meeting on
September 7, 2001.

    On September 19, 2001, by unanimous written consent, the board of directors
of T T Acquisition Corp. approved and adopted the merger agreement, and Titan,
as the sole stockholder of T T Acquisition Corp., approved and adopted the
merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger.

    On September 19, 2001, the BTG board of directors evaluated the offer from
Titan and considered and analyzed a number of factors, including a presentation
from Quarterdeck regarding Titan and its offer. Quarterdeck presented a written
opinion, a copy of which is attached as ANNEX D to this proxy
statement/prospectus, to the effect that, subject to certain assumptions and
limitations and based upon the terms presented in Titan's offer, as of the date
of the opinion, the consideration to be received by BTG shareholders pursuant to
the proposed merger agreement, was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
BTG shareholders. At the September 19, 2001 meeting, the BTG board of directors
unanimously determined that the merger is in the best interests of BTG and
approved and adopted the merger

agreement, the plan of merger, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated in the merger agreement. In addition, the BTG board of directors
unanimously determined to recommend that BTG shareholders vote to approve the
merger agreement, plan of merger and the merger.

    On the evening of September 19, 2001, the merger agreement was executed and
delivered by Titan, BTG and T T Acquisition Corp., and the voting agreement was
executed and delivered by Titan and Dr. Edward Bersoff, Marilynn D. Bersoff,
Donald M. Wallach, John E. Littley, III and Linda E. Hill. Before the New York
Stock Exchange or Nasdaq began trading on September 20, 2001, Titan and BTG each
issued a press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement and the
proposed merger.

BTG'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    At the special meeting of the board of directors held on September 19, 2001,
the board of directors voted unanimously to approve the merger agreement, the
plan of merger, the merger, the shareholder voting agreements and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to direct that the merger
agreement, plan of merger and the merger be submitted to a vote of BTG's
shareholders and to recommend that BTG's shareholders vote to approve the merger
agreement, the plan of merger and the merger. In the course of reaching its
decision to enter into the merger agreement, BTG's board of directors consulted
with its senior management, outside legal counsel and Quarterdeck, reviewed a
significant amount of information and considered a number of factors, the most
relevant of which include the following:

    - that by combining complementary operations, the combined company would
      have better opportunities for future growth;

    - the opportunity for BTG's shareholders to participate in a larger, more
      diversified organization and to benefit from the potential appreciation in
      the value of Titan's common stock;

    - information concerning the business, earnings, operations, competitive
      position and prospects of BTG and Titan both individually and on a
      combined basis;

    - the opportunity for BTG shareholders to receive a significant premium over
      the existing market price for shares of BTG's common stock prior to the
      announcement of the merger;

    - the review of, and discussions with, BTG senior management and legal
      advisors regarding certain business, financial, legal and accounting
      aspects of the merger, the results of the legal and financial due
      diligence and a review of the terms and conditions to the merger;

    - the opinion of Quarterdeck that, as of September 19, 2001, and subject to
      the assumptions and limitations set forth in the fairness opinion, the
      consideration to be received by BTG shareholders was fair, from a
      financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of BTG's
      common stock and the financial presentation made by Quarterdeck to the
      board of directors of BTG in connection with the delivery of its opinion;

    - the possibility, as alternatives to the merger, of seeking to acquire
      another company, seeking to engage in one or more joint ventures, seeking
      to raise additional capital, or seeking to engage in a business
      combination with an organization other than Titan;

    - the likely impact of the merger on BTG's employees and customers;

    - BTG's prospects as a stand-alone company, the uncertainties facing BTG,
      the outlook for its current strategies and the prospects for achieving
      maximum long-term value on a stand-alone basis;

    - the interests that certain executive officers and directors of BTG may
      have with respect to the merger, in addition to their interests as
      shareholders of BTG generally, as described in "THE

      MERGER--CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN BTG AND ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS,
      DIRECTORS AND AFFILIATES" starting on page 48;

    - the fact that the parties intended for the merger to qualify as a tax-free
      transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except for tax liability
      resulting from any cash received for fractional shares by the holders of
      BTG's common stock) which would permit BTG's shareholders to receive Titan
      common stock in a tax-free exchange; and

    - the history of contacts with other potential strategic partners and the
      judgment of BTG's board and management that it was unlikely that any other
      party would be a more attractive strategic partner or make a proposal more
      favorable to BTG and its shareholders than Titan.

    BTG's board of directors also considered a number of potentially negative
factors in its deliberations concerning the merger. The negative factors
considered by the board of directors of BTG included:

    - the risk that the merger would not be completed in a timely manner or at
      all;

    - the possible negative effects of the public announcement of the merger on
      BTG's sales, relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, and
      operating results;

    - the fact that BTG shareholders will not receive the full benefit of any
      future growth in the value of their equity that BTG may have achieved as
      an independent company, and the potential disadvantage to BTG shareholders
      in the event that Titan does not perform as well in the future as BTG may
      have performed as an independent company;

    - the substantial management time and effort that will be required to
      consummate the merger and integrate the operations of the two companies;

    - the possibility that certain provisions of the merger agreement,
      including, among others, the no solicitation and termination fee payment
      provisions of the merger agreement and the fact that certain officers,
      directors and significant shareholders of BTG executed shareholder voting
      agreements, would likely have the effect of discouraging other persons
      potentially interested in merging with or acquiring BTG from pursuing such
      an opportunity; and

    - the other risks and uncertainties discussed above under "RISK FACTORS"
      starting on page 20 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

    The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
board of directors of BTG is not intended to be exhaustive. In view of the wide
variety of the material factors considered in connection with the evaluation of
the merger and the complexity of these matters, the board of directors of BTG
did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to
assign any relative weight to the various factors considered. In addition, the
board of directors of BTG did not undertake to make any specific determination
as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was
favorable or unfavorable to the ultimate determination of the board of directors
of BTG, but rather the board of directors of BTG conducted an overall analysis
of the factors described above, including discussions with and questioning of
BTG's senior management, and legal and financial advisers. In considering the
factors described above, individual members of the board of directors of BTG may
have given different weight to different factors.

OPINION OF QUARTERDECK

    Quarterdeck was retained by BTG to render an opinion as to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to BTG's shareholders of the consideration to be
paid by Titan in the merger. On September 19, 2001, Quarterdeck rendered its
oral opinion to the BTG Board of Directors, and issued a written opinion dated
September 19, 2001 that as of such date, and subject to the assumptions, factors
and limitations stated in its opinion, the consideration to be received was fair
to BTG's shareholders from a financial point of view.

    In arriving at its opinion, Quarterdeck reviewed, among other things, the
merger agreement; certain publicly available business and financial information
relating to BTG and Titan for recent years and interim periods to date; and
certain financial forecasts and projections that were provided to Quarterdeck by
BTG, taking into account its growth prospects and the market in which it is
involved. In addition, Quarterdeck held discussions with the management of BTG
and Titan regarding past and current business operations and future prospects of
their respective companies.

    In reviewing the merger agreement, Quarterdeck took into account the
financial terms of the merger as set forth in the merger agreement in relation
to, among other things, (1) current and historical market prices and trading
volumes of the BTG Common Stock and Titan Common Stock; (2) the limited trading
volume and public float of the BTG Common Stock; (3) the historical and
projected earnings of BTG; and (4) the performance in the public market of
companies similar to BTG. Furthermore, Quarterdeck utilized a discounted cash
flow analysis to analyze the present value of the future free cash flows that
BTG projects from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2004. In addition to the
foregoing, Quarterdeck performed such other studies, analyses and investigations
and considered such other financial, economic and market criteria as it
considered appropriate in arriving at its opinion.

    In rendering its opinion, Quarterdeck relied, without independent
verification, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial information
and forecasts and other information provided to it by BTG and Titan or through
publicly available sources. With respect to the financial projections and other
information provided by BTG's management, Quarterdeck was advised that in
management's opinion such forecasts and other information were reasonably
prepared using the best currently available estimates and judgments as to the
financial and operational timing and achievability thereof. Quarterdeck's
opinion was limited by the fact that although requested by Quarterdeck, no
internal financial or operating information, forecasts or projections with
respect to Titan were provided to Quarterdeck. With respect to financial
projections relating to Titan, Quarterdeck reviewed and relied on, with the
consent of BTG's management and board of directors, certain publicly available
opinions of certain analysts with respect to such projections and assumed that
the projections contained therein represent reasonable estimates with respect to
the future performance of Titan. With respect to other due diligence matters
relating to Titan, Quarterdeck relied on BTG's review of such matters and due
diligence without any independent verification thereof.

    THE FULL TEXT OF THE WRITTEN OPINION OF QUARTERDECK DATED SEPTEMBER 19,
2001, WHICH SETS FORTH THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, MATTERS CONSIDERED AND LIMITATIONS
ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN, IS ATTACHED HERETO AS ANNEX D AND SHOULD BE READ
CAREFULLY IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE OPINION OF QUARTERDECK WAS PREPARED FOR USE BY
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BTG AND RELATES ONLY TO THE FAIRNESS FROM A FINANCIAL
POINT OF VIEW OF THE CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED BY BTG'S SHAREHOLDERS AS OF
SEPTEMBER 19, 2001 PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A
RECOMMENDATION TO ANY SHAREHOLDER AS TO HOW SUCH SHAREHOLDER SHOULD VOTE AT THE
SPECIAL MEETING. THE SUMMARY OF THE OPINION OF QUARTERDECK SET FORTH IN THIS
PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE FULL
TEXT OF SUCH OPINION, INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS CONTAINED
THEREIN.

    In preparing its opinion, Quarterdeck performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is subject to
certain complex financial analyses, the application of those methodologies to
the circumstances at hand, and the global economic and equity market conditions
at the time such opinion is prepared, and accordingly does not lend itself to a
summary description. As such, Quarterdeck has told BTG that it believes its
analyses must be considered in their totality and that selected portions of such
analyses could be misleading or create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying such analyses and opinion. In addition, as reported by Quarterdeck to
BTG's board of directors, some analyses were given greater weight than others.
The following is a summary of the analyses Quarterdeck utilized in connection
with providing its opinion to the board of directors.

    SELECTED TRANSACTION ANALYSIS.  Quarterdeck analyzed certain information
including the purchase price and implied transaction value multiples paid in
selected transactions in the government services industry. Quarterdeck selected
the companies used in this analysis based upon a variety of characteristics
including, but not limited to, the similarity of their size, growth,
profitability and customer base to that of BTG ("Selected Transactions").
Quarterdeck compared multiples of aggregate consideration (total consideration
including assumed indebtedness less cash and marketable securities) ("AC") of
each Selected Transaction to (1) sales; (2) earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"); and (3) earnings before interest and
taxes ("EBIT") calculated from the most recently reported financials, typically
the latest fiscal year. All of the multiples were based upon information
available at the time of the announcement of the transaction. The mean and
median multiples from the Selected Transactions were applied to BTG's sales,
EBITDA, and EBIT using financials from their fiscal year ending March 31, 2001
(adjusted to eliminate discontinued operations and certain non-recurring
expenses such as severance and to include the recent acquisition of RPI) and
compared to the multiples for the contemplated transaction. Such analysis
indicated that for the Selected Transactions (1) AC as a multiple of sales
ranged from 0.4x to 1.8x with a mean and median of 0.8x, as compared to
approximately 0.7x implied by the merger consideration; (2) AC as a multiple of
EBITDA ranged from 6.5x to 17.0x with a mean and median of 9.9x and 8.5x,
respectively, as compared to approximately 10.3x implied by the merger
consideration; and (3) AC as a multiple of EBIT ranged from 4.7x to 29.6x with a
mean and median of 12.7x and 11.3x respectively, as compared to approximately
11.7x implied by the merger consideration.

    SELECTED COMPARABLE COMPANY ANALYSIS.  Quarterdeck compared selected
historical stock market and balance sheet data and financial ratios for BTG to
the corresponding multiples and ratios of the following selected services
companies: Affiliated Computer Services; American Management Systems, Inc.; CACI
International, Inc.; Computer Sciences Corporation; Dynamics Research
Corporation; Electronic Data Systems Corporation; and Maximus, Inc. Quarterdeck
selected the companies used in this analysis based on a variety of
characteristics including their government market presence, similarity of size,
growth, profitability and customer base to that of BTG. The data and ratios
Quarterdeck compared included, among other things, enterprise value (current
stock price multiplied by the total shares outstanding plus all indebtedness of
the company plus any preferred stock outstanding less cash and marketable
securities) ("EV") compared to: (1) last twelve months ("LTM") sales; (2) LTM
EBITDA; and (3) LTM EBIT. The ratios were calculated as of September 18, 2001
and compared to BTG's LTM financials (adjusted to eliminate discontinued
operations and certain non-recurring expenses such as severance and to include
the recent acquisition of RPI). An analysis of EV to LTM sales yielded a range
of 0.5x to 2.2x with a mean and median of 1.2x as compared to approximately 0.7x
implied by the merger consideration. An analysis of EV to LTM EBITDA yielded a
range of 4.1x to 14.6x with a mean and median of 9.3x and 9.2x, respectively, as
compared to approximately 12.4x implied by the merger consideration. An analysis
of EV to LTM EBIT yielded a range of 5.9x to 20.7x with a mean and median of
13.8x and 13.7x, respectively, as compared to approximately 14.9x implied by the
merger consideration.

    No company, transaction or business used in the "Selected Transaction
Analysis" or the "Selected Comparable Company Analysis" as a comparable (the
"Comparable Companies") is identical to BTG or the merger. Due to varying growth
rates and profitability differences between Comparable Companies, Quarterdeck
placed greatest weight in the "Selected Transaction Analysis" and the "Selected
Comparable Company Analysis" on AC and EV, respectively, as multiples of EBITDA.
Accordingly, the results of the foregoing are not entirely mathematical. Instead
it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of each of the businesses, which could
affect the multiples being used for comparison. All of the applicable
transaction multiples used in the "Selected Transaction Analysis" and the
"Selected Comparable Company Analysis" were based on Titan's closing price as of
September 18, 2001.

    DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  Quarterdeck performed a discounted cash flow
analysis of BTG. Quarterdeck calculated a net present value of discounted free
cash flows for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 using discount rates ranging from
9.5% to 12.5%. Quarterdeck calculated BTG's terminal value in fiscal year 2004
based on multiples ranging from 5.5x EBITDA to 7.5x EBITDA. These terminal
values were then discounted to their net present value using discount rates
ranging from 9.5% to 12.5%. Using the foregoing terminal values and discounted
cash flows for BTG and based on management's forecasts, the equity value per
share ranged from $9.96 to $14.58 per share as compared to the equity value per
share implied by the merger consideration.

    SELECTED PREMIUM ANALYSIS.  Using publicly available information,
Quarterdeck reviewed the premiums paid in merger and acquisition transactions
involving companies providing government services, consisting of
(acquirer/target): AT&T/GRC International, Inc.; Titan/Advanced Communication
Systems; Computer Sciences Corporation/Nichols Research Corporation; Anteon
Corporation/Analysis & Technology, Inc.; CACI International, Inc./QuesTech;
Affiliated Computer Systems/Computer Data Systems, Inc.; TRW, Inc./BDM
International, Inc.; and Northrop Grumman Corporation/Logicon, Inc. Quarterdeck
compared the premium offered in these transactions for the period of 1, 30, 60,
and 90 day(s) prior to the announcement of a transaction (the "Stated Period")
with the premium offered by the merger consideration for BTG. This analysis
indicated that the range of premiums offered during the Stated Period averaged
22.7% for the 1-day period, 32.0% for the 30-day period, 38.8% for the 60-day
period and 41.4% for the 90-day period. These averages were applied to BTG's 1,
30, 60, and 90 day closing price averages, calculated from September 18, 2001,
implying a value of $11.90 to $12.82 per share as compared to the proposed
merger consideration.

    STOCK TRADING HISTORY.  Quarterdeck examined the two-year history of the
trading prices and volumes for the shares of BTG and Titan common stock. During
this period, BTG's common stock reached a high of $11.00 per share and a low of
$5.13 per share, with an average price of $7.60 per share. The merger
consideration represents a premium of 76% (using Titan's stock price as of the
date of the Fairness Opinion) to the average stock price for the previous two
years. BTG's average daily trading volume during this period was approximately
24,900 shares. Titan common stock reached a high of $57.44 per share and a low
of $11.94 per share, with an average of $25.83 per share. Titan's average daily
trading volume for the previous two years was approximately 689,200 shares.
Quarterdeck also considered Titan's public offering of 7.5 million shares for
$18.00 per share on August 5, 2001.

    In addition to the foregoing analyses, Quarterdeck performed several other
analyses to support its opinion. Quarterdeck also considered BTG's recent
unsuccessful marketing and auction efforts, led by other financial advisors to
BTG in May 2000 in an attempted sale process. In evaluating the merger
consideration, Quarterdeck also reviewed analyst reports of Titan. Using
analyst's estimates, Quarterdeck assembled a break-up analysis of Titan's
various business segments.

    As described above, Quarterdeck's opinion to the board of directors of BTG
was one of many factors taken into consideration by the board of directors in
making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary
of the analyses performed by Quarterdeck does not purport

to be a complete description of those analyses and is qualified by the full
written opinion set forth in ANNEX D. Quarterdeck has consented to the inclusion
of its opinion as ANNEX D and of the description of its opinion in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

    As part of its investment banking services, Quarterdeck regularly engages in
the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions involving both listed and unlisted companies and their associated
securities, primarily in the aerospace and defense and information
technology/professional services industries. Quarterdeck received a fee of
$500,000 from BTG for rendering its opinion. The fee rendered for its fairness
opinion is not contingent upon the results of the merger.

TITAN'S REASONS FOR THE MERGER

    Titan believes a business combination with BTG will advance its strategic
objective of taking advantage through acquisitions of growth opportunities from
the ongoing consolidation in the defense information technology industry. Titan
expects the combination with BTG to offer the following strategic benefits to
Titan after the merger:

    - enhancement of Titan's defense business revenues;

    - augmentation of Titan's employee base in the Washington, D.C. area, where
      a significant portion of its defense business is conducted;

    - expansion of Titan's defense customer base; and

    - broadening of Titan's capability to serve the defense industry and to
      compete for new projects.

    Titan's board of directors has determined that the merger is in the best
interests of Titan and its stockholders. In reaching its determination, Titan's
board of directors considered a number of factors, including the factors
discussed above and listed below. The conclusions reached by Titan's board of
directors with respect to the following factors supported its determination that
the merger and the issuance of shares of Titan common stock in the merger were
fair to, and in the best interests of, Titan and its stockholders:

    - the judgment, advice and analysis of Titan's management with respect to
      the potential strategic, financial and operational benefits of the merger,
      including management's favorable recommendation of the merger, based in
      part on the business, technical, financial, accounting and legal due
      diligence investigations performed with respect to BTG;

    - the results of operations and financial condition of Titan and BTG; and

    - the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements, including the
      exchange ratio and structure, which were determined by both the board of
      directors and management of Titan to provide a fair and equitable basis
      for the merger.

    Titan's board of directors also considered a number of potentially negative
factors in its deliberations concerning the merger. The potentially negative
factors considered by Titan's board of directors included:

    - the risk that the transaction might not be completed in a timely manner or
      at all;

    - the potential dilutive effect on the Titan common stock price if revenue
      and earnings expectations of the combined company are not met;

    - the potential loss of key BTG employees critical to the ongoing success of
      the BTG products and to the successful integration of the Titan and BTG
      product lines;

    - the general difficulties of integrating products, technologies and
      companies; and

    - the other risks and uncertainties discussed above in the section entitled
      "RISK FACTORS" starting on page 20.

    The above discussion of information and factors considered by Titan's board
of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed to include all
material factors considered by the board. In view of the wide variety of factors
considered by Titan's board of directors, the board did not find it practicable
to quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors
considered. In addition, Titan's board did not reach any specific conclusion on
each factor considered, or any aspect of any particular factor, but conducted an
overall analysis of these factors.

    Individual members of Titan's board may have given different weight to
different factors. However, after taking into account all of the factors
described above, Titan's board of directors determined that the merger agreement
and the merger were fair to, and in the best interests of, Titan and that Titan
should proceed with the merger.

INTERESTS OF BTG'S OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IN THE MERGER

    Certain of BTG's directors and officers may have interests in the merger
that may be different from, or in addition to, their interest as BTG
shareholders. You should be aware of those interests when considering the
unanimous recommendation of the BTG board that BTG shareholders vote to approve
the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger at the BTG special
meeting.

    TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS

    BTG grants stock options to its employees, officers and directors under
BTG's 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan, as amended (the "1995 Plan"), and its
Second Amended and Restated Directors Stock Option Plan (the "Directors Option
Plan" and collectively with the 1995 Plan, the "Option Plans"), and issues stock
purchase rights under its Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
Annual Leave Stock Plan and Non-Employee Director Stock Purchase Plan
(collectively, the "Purchase Plans").

    Under the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each option
outstanding under the 1995 Plan will be assumed by Titan and will be converted
into an option to or right to purchase Titan common stock, subject to
appropriate adjustments to reflect the exchange ratio. All options granted under
the 1995 Plan on or after December 17, 1998 provide for 100% vesting upon a
change of control and, accordingly, will fully vest and become exercisable at
the effective time of the merger. At the effective time of the merger, the
Directors Option Plan and each option outstanding thereunder, to the extent not
exercised before the effective time, will be terminated.

    After the close of business on September 30, 2001, the Purchase Plans were
suspended and, at the effective time of the merger, the Purchase Plans and any
outstanding rights to purchase BTG common stock thereunder will be terminated.

    INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS

    After the effective time of the merger, Titan will, and will cause BTG, as
the surviving corporation, to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations
of BTG pursuant to any indemnification provisions under BTG's articles of
incorporation or bylaws as in effect on the date of the merger agreement for
acts or omissions that occurred prior to the effective time of the merger.

    In addition, for a period of six years after the effective time, the
surviving corporation will provide directors' and officers' liability insurance
for BTG officers and directors on terms at least as favorable as insurance
maintained by BTG as of the date of the merger agreement, for acts or omissions
that occurred prior to the effective time.

    In addition, from and after the effective time, Titan will provide
directors' and officers' liability coverage for continuing directors and
officers of BTG with respect to acts and omissions after the effective time
under Titan's existing policy for its own directors and officers.

    As a result of the personal interests described above, several BTG officers
and directors may have a conflict of interest that could have influenced their
support of the merger.

CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN BTG AND ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND
  AFFILIATES

    Effective April 1, 2000, BTG entered into an employment agreement with
Edward H. Bersoff, pursuant to which Dr. Bersoff serves as the President and
Chief Executive Officer of BTG, and is employed for a term ending on March 31,
2004. BTG also has entered into employment agreements with John Littley, III,
Linda E. Hill, Leslie A. Rose, Robert J. Osterloh and Thomas W. Weston, Jr.,
effective for the same term. Under the agreements, the following minimum annual
base salaries are to be paid to each of these executive officers: Dr. Bersoff,
$450,000; Dr. Littley, $195,000; Ms. Hill, $189,000; Mr. Rose, $180,000; Mr.
Osterloh, $175,000; and Mr. Weston, $180,000. Each of these officers is also
eligible to receive annual incentive compensation based on target percentages of
base salary. Pursuant to each agreement, the board of directors of BTG may
terminate the executive's employment for willful and gross misconduct, or in the
case of death, or due to illness or disability which prevents the executive from
substantially fulfilling his or her duties for a period in excess of six
consecutive months. Either BTG or the executive may terminate an agreement at
any time, without cause, upon not less than 30 days notice. In the event that
BTG terminates the employment of Dr. Bersoff, Ms. Hill or Mr. Weston, other than
for cause, during the terms of their respective agreements, they shall be
entitled to receive lump sum payments (less applicable taxes) of 450%, 142% and
133% of base salary, respectively.

    If, within two years of a change in control of BTG, either (i) BTG
terminates the employment of any of these executive officers without cause (as
that term is defined in the agreements); or (ii) any such officer terminates his
or her employment for good reason (as that term is defined in the agreements),
each such officer shall be entitled to the following lump sum payment (less
applicable taxes) as a percentage of base salary: Dr. Bersoff, 450%; Dr.
Littley, Ms. Hill, Mr. Rose, and Mr. Osterloh, 284%; and Mr. Weston, 265%. In
addition, if any one or more of these executives receives an "excess parachute
payment" under section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and thereby becomes subject to the 20% excise tax imposed on such
payments, the executive is entitled to an additional tax gross-up payment in an
amount that will result in the executive netting the amount of the excise tax,
after taxes. These agreements also provide for 100% vesting of all options
granted to these executives upon a change of control. The agreements include
confidentiality provisions, as well as covenants regarding non-competition and
non-solicitation. The merger will constitute a change in control of BTG under
these agreements.

    BTG's flexible benefits plans for employees were administered by Ceridian
Corporation until December 31, 2000. Ronald Turner, a director of BTG, is also
Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Ceridian Corporation. In
fiscal 2001, BTG paid Ceridian Corporation $10,257.75. In fiscal 2001, BTG paid
Wallach Associates, Inc. $17,500 for professional recruiting services. The
common stock of Wallach Associates, Inc. is wholly owned by Donald M. Wallach, a
director of BTG. In fiscal 2001, BTG and its subsidiaries paid Del South Holding
a total of $184,252.54 in rent, on certain properties leased in Niceville,
Florida. Leslie A. Rose, a Senior Vice President of BTG, wholly owns Del South
Holding. With the exception of the foregoing, neither BTG nor any of its
subsidiaries has, since the beginning of the last fiscal year, been a party to
any transactions or relationships described in Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K.

MANAGEMENT OF TITAN AFTER THE MERGER

    The management of Titan after the merger will remain unchanged. Information
about the current directors and executive officers of Titan can be found in
Titan's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000, which is incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE
INFORMATION."

MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

    The following discussion sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax
considerations of the transaction to holders of shares of BTG common stock who
exchange their shares of BTG common stock for cash and Titan shares in the
merger. This discussion and the tax opinions described below are based on the
Code, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations and court
decisions in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all of
which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could alter
the tax consequences described in this summary and the tax opinions.

    This discussion of material federal income tax consequences of the
transaction is not intended to provide a complete analysis or description of all
potential federal income tax consequences of the merger. It does not address all
aspects of federal income taxation that may be important to a holder of shares
of BTG common stock in light of that stockholder's particular circumstances or
to a stockholder subject to special rules, such as:

    - a foreign entity or an individual stockholder who is not a citizen or
      resident of the U.S.;

    - a financial institution or insurance company;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - a dealer or broker in securities;

    - a stockholder who is subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of
      the Code;

    - a stockholder whose shares are qualified small business stock for purposes
      of Section 1202 of the Code;

    - a stockholder who holds shares of BTG common stock as part of a hedge,
      appreciated financial position, straddle, constructive sale or conversion
      transaction;

    - a stockholder who acquired shares of BTG common stock pursuant to the
      exercise of incentive stock options or who holds shares of BTG common
      stock that are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or

    - a stockholder who does not hold shares of BTG common stock as capital
      assets.

    In addition, this discussion does not address any state, local or foreign
income tax or non-income tax consequences of the merger or of any transactions
other than the merger. TITAN URGES HOLDERS OF SHARES OF BTG COMMON STOCK TO
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL INCOME TAX OR
OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER.

    QUALIFICATION OF THE MERGER AS A REORGANIZATION

    Subject to the assumptions and limitations discussed in such opinions, in
the opinion of Hogan & Hartson L.L.P., counsel to Titan, and of Venable, Baetjer
and Howard, LLP, counsel to BTG, the transaction will be treated for federal
income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code if the merger is completed under the current terms of the merger

agreement. If the merger qualifies as a tax-free reorganization as described
above, for federal income tax purposes:

    - Holders of BTG common stock will not be permitted to recognize any loss
      for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the receipt of Titan common stock
      and cash in exchange for their BTG common stock. However, a holder of
      shares of BTG common stock will recognize gain equal to the lesser of (1)
      the amount of cash received in the merger and (2) an amount equal to (a)
      the fair market value of the Titan common stock and cash received in the
      merger minus (b) the stockholder's tax basis for the shares of BTG common
      stock exchanged in the merger. Any such gain will generally be long-term
      capital gain if the shares of BTG have been held for more than one year.
      However, if the receipt of cash has the effect of a distribution of a
      dividend (determined by application of Section 302 of the Code on a
      stockholder-by-stockholder basis), some or all of this gain may be treated
      as a dividend, and taxed as ordinary income. The likelihood of dividend
      treatment may depend on the value of the Titan stock received in the
      merger compared to the amount of cash received in the merger. The
      likelihood of dividend treatment may also depend on whether the
      stockholder, or persons whose stock ownership is attributed to the
      stockholder, also hold Titan common stock prior to the merger, and may
      depend on other factors. HOLDERS OF BTG COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR
      OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE POSSIBILITY THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF THE
      CASH RECEIVED IN THE MERGER WILL BE TREATED AS A DIVIDEND.

    - If a holder of shares of BTG common stock receives cash instead of
      fractional shares of Titan common stock, the stockholder will be required
      to recognize gain or loss, measured by the difference between the amount
      of cash received instead of that fraction of a share and the portion of
      the tax basis of that holder's shares of BTG common stock allocable to
      that fraction of a share. This gain or loss generally will be long-term
      capital gain or loss if the holder of shares of BTG common stock has held
      the shares of BTG common stock exchanged for the cash received instead of
      that fraction of a Titan share for more than one year at the time the
      shares of BTG common stock are accepted at the completion of the merger.
      However, if the receipt of cash instead of fractional shares is
      essentially equivalent to a dividend (determined by application of Section
      302 of the Code on a stockholder-by-stockholder basis), some or all of
      this gain may be treated as a dividend and taxed as ordinary income.

    - A holder of shares of BTG common stock will have a tax basis in the Titan
      shares received in the merger (including any fraction of a share of Titan
      stock deemed received) equal to (1) the tax basis in the shares of BTG
      common stock surrendered by that stockholder in the merger, reduced by (2)
      the amount of any cash consideration received by that stockholder in the
      merger, and increased by (3) the amount of any gain recognized by that
      stockholder in the merger (including any portion of such gain that is
      treated as a dividend).

    - The holding period for Titan shares received in exchange for shares of BTG
      common stock in the merger will include the holding period for shares of
      BTG common stock surrendered in the merger.

    - No gain or loss will be recognized by Titan, T T Acquisition Corp. or BTG
      as a result of the merger.

    The completion of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt by Titan and
BTG of tax opinions to the above effect from Hogan & Hartson L.L.P. and Venable,
Baetjer and Howard, LLP, respectively. These opinions, and the opinions
contained herein, are based upon representations and covenants made by Titan and
BTG, including representations in certificates of officers of Titan and BTG to
be delivered to tax counsel before completion of the merger, and upon certain
assumptions, including the absence of changes in facts or in law between the
date of the delivery of the representations and the completion of the merger. If
any of those representations, covenants or assumptions is inaccurate, the

tax consequences of the transaction could differ materially from those
summarized below. In addition, the ability to satisfy the supporting conditions
depends in part on facts that will not be available before the completion of the
merger. There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, or that the
supporting conditions will be satisfied. If the supporting conditions are not
satisfied, the opinions of Hogan & Hartson and Venable, Baetjer and Howard
described above may not be relied upon. Furthermore, Hogan & Hartson's and
Venable, Baetjer and Howard's opinions represent only their best judgment of the
tax consequences of the merger. Such opinions will neither bind the Internal
Revenue Service nor preclude the IRS or the courts from adopting a contrary
position. Accordingly, it is possible that the merger may not qualify as a
reorganization, and the tax consequences of the transaction could differ
materially from those summarized below.

    TITAN URGES EACH HOLDER OF SHARES OF BTG COMMON STOCK TO CONSULT HIS OR HER
OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL OR
FOREIGN INCOME OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER.

    FEDERAL BACKUP WITHHOLDING

    The cash payments due to a holder on the exchange of BTG common stock in the
merger, other than certain exempt persons or entities, will be subject to
"backup withholding" at a rate of approximately 30% for U.S. federal income tax
purposes unless the holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a
correct taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules are not an additional tax and may be refunded or
credited against the holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is furnished to the IRS.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    The transaction described in this proxy statement/prospectus will be
accounted for as a "purchase," as that term is used under generally accepted
accounting principles, commonly referred to as "GAAP," for accounting and
financial reporting purposes. BTG will be treated as the acquired corporation
for these purposes. BTG's assets, liabilities and other items will be adjusted
to their estimated fair value at the completion of the merger and combined with
the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of Titan. Applicable
income tax effects of these adjustments will be included as a component of the
combined company's deferred tax asset or liability. On June 29, 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, adopted changes to the method of
accounting for goodwill in a purchase transaction from capitalization and
amortization against earnings to capitalization and periodic evaluation for
impairment. The change is effective with respect to all business combinations
accounted as a purchase and completed after June 30, 2001. As a result,
unamortized goodwill resulting from this transaction will be reported as an
asset and not amortized against earnings unless it becomes impaired. For further
information concerning the amount of goodwill or other intangibles to be
recorded in connection with the merger and the amortization of that goodwill,
see the section entitled "NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" on page 88.

REGULATORY APPROVALS

    Other than clearance under the antitrust laws applicable to the transaction
which are described below, the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring the
registration statement on Form S-4 relating to this transaction effective and
the filing of articles of merger under Virginia law with respect to the merger,
Titan does not believe that any additional material governmental filings are
required with respect to the transaction.

    Titan and BTG have determined that a filing of a notification under the HSR
Act is required in connection with the merger. The HSR Act prevents transactions
from being completed until required

information and materials are furnished to the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, and the applicable
waiting periods are terminated or expire. After this occurs, the notifications
filed under the HSR Act remain effective and permit closing of the merger within
one year from the termination or expiration of the waiting periods.

    At any time before or after the termination or expiration of the waiting
periods and completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take any action
under U.S. antitrust laws that it deems necessary or desirable, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking the divestiture of
substantial assets of Titan or BTG. Private parties and state attorneys general
may also bring actions under U.S. antitrust laws depending on the circumstances.
We can give no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds
will not be made or, if a challenge were made, that it would not be successful.

    Completion of the merger also may be subject to compliance with a limited
number of foreign antitrust regulations. Any notifications required by any
foreign jurisdictions will be filed in due course.

APPROVAL OF THE MERGER

    Under Virginia law, approval of a merger requires the adoption of a plan of
merger by the board of directors of the company, except under certain
circumstances, the recommendation by the board of directors that the
shareholders approve the plan of merger and the approval by each voting group
entitled to vote on the plan of merger by more than two-thirds of all the votes
entitled to be cast by that voting group. BTG's board of directors has
unanimously adopted the plan of merger and recommended that BTG shareholders
approve the plan of merger. The affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of BTG common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting
are required to approve the plan of merger.

    Titan stockholders are not required to adopt the merger agreement under
Delaware law because Titan is not a constituent corporation to the merger or,
assuming the market price of Titan's common stock does not precipitously decline
for a sustained period prior to closing, under the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange. However, in the event that Titan's stock price so declined, Titan
would not be obligated to close the proposed transaction unless Titan sought and
won the approval of its stockholders.

AMENDMENT TO BTG'S SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

    In connection with the approval of the merger agreement, plan of merger and
merger by the board of directors of BTG, BTG amended its rights agreement, dated
as of September 16, 1998, by and between First Union National Bank, as rights
agent, as amended. Pursuant to this amendment, none of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, will trigger the BTG
rights agreement or otherwise result in any obligation to the holders of rights
by Titan, T T Acquisition Corp. or BTG, as the surviving corporation in the
merger.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    Under Virginia law, BTG shareholders do not have appraisal rights in
connection with the merger.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TITAN AND BTG

    Except for the Voting Agreements or as otherwise described in this proxy
statement/prospectus, neither Titan nor, to the best of Titan's knowledge, any
of its directors, executive officers or other affiliates has any contract,
arrangement, understanding or relationship with any other person with respect to
any securities of BTG, including, but not limited to, any contract, arrangement,
understanding or relationship concerning the transfer or the voting of any
securities, joint ventures,

loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guaranties of loans, guaranties
against loss or the giving or withholding of proxies. Except as described in
this proxy statement/prospectus, there have been no contacts, negotiations or
transactions since January 1, 1996, between Titan or, to the best of Titan's
knowledge, any of its directors, executive officers or other affiliates on the
one hand, and BTG or its affiliates, on the other hand, concerning a merger,
consolidation or acquisition, a tender offer or other acquisition of securities,
an election of directors, or a sale or other transfer of a material amount of
assets. Neither Titan nor, to the best of Titan's knowledge, any of its
directors, executive officers or other affiliates has since January 1, 1996 had
any transaction with BTG or any of its officers, directors or affiliates that
would require disclosure under the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission applicable to the merger.

    Neither Titan nor, to the best of Titan's knowledge, any of its directors,
executive officers or other affiliates beneficially owns or has any right to
acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of BTG common stock.

    Neither Titan nor, to the best of Titan's knowledge, any of its directors,
executive officers or other affiliates has effected any transaction in shares of
BTG common stock during the past 60 days.

RESTRICTIONS ON RESALE OF TITAN COMMON STOCK BY AFFILIATES

    The issuance of Titan shares to BTG shareholders in connection with the
merger has been registered under the Securities Act. Such shares may be traded
freely and without restriction by those BTG shareholders who are not deemed to
be BTG "affiliates," as that term is defined under the Securities Act, at the
time the merger agreement is submitted for approval by the BTG shareholders at
the special meeting. An affiliate of BTG is a person who directly, or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under
common control with BTG. Any subsequent transfer of Titan common stock issued in
the merger by any BTG affiliate will, under existing law, require one of the
following:

    - registration of the transfer under the Securities Act;

    - compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act, which allows limited
      sales under specified circumstances; or

    - availability of another exemption from registration.

    The foregoing restrictions are expected to apply to, among other persons,
directors and executive officers of BTG and any holders of 10% or more of the
BTG common stock converted in the merger.

    This proxy statement/prospectus does not cover any resales of Titan common
stock, including Titan common stock issuable upon the exercise of any assumed
options, to be received by BTG shareholders upon completion of the merger. No
person is authorized to make use of this proxy statement/ prospectus in
connection with any resale.

ANTI-DILUTION ADJUSTMENTS

    If between September 19, 2001 and the effective date of the merger, the
outstanding shares of Titan common stock or BTG common stock are changed into a
different number of shares because of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or if any dividend payable in stock
or other securities is declared on such shares with a record date within this
period, the merger agreement requires that the exchange ratio be adjusted
accordingly to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by the merger
agreement before such reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange or dividend.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

    Titan has agreed to deposit the cash and certificates representing the
shares of Titan common stock to be issued or paid under the merger agreement
with First Union National Bank, which will act as exchange agent in the merger
for the benefit of the holders of issued and outstanding shares of BTG common
stock. Titan will cause the exchange agent to mail a letter of transmittal to
each holder of BTG common stock. The letter of transmittal will contain
instructions on how BTG shareholders may surrender their BTG stock certificates
to the exchange agent in exchange for the cash and Titan certificates.

    YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY, AND
YOU SHOULD NOT FORWARD THEM TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT UNTIL YOU RECEIVE THE LETTER
OF TRANSMITTAL. FOLLOWING YOUR RECEIPT OF THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, YOU SHOULD
FORWARD THE CERTIFICATES ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS SPECIFIED IN
THE LETTER.

    After the effective time of the merger and until BTG shareholders surrender
the certificates representing their BTG common stock for exchange, holders of
these certificates will not be paid any dividends or other distributions
declared after the effective time of the merger on the Titan common stock
issuable to such stockholders in the merger. Any such unpaid dividends or other
distributions on such Titan common stock will be paid, without interest, only to
the holders who have properly tendered their BTG common stock certificates for
exchange. All stock certificates presented after the effective time of the
merger will be canceled and exchanged for the applicable cash and a certificate
or certificates representing the applicable number of shares of Titan common
stock to be received in the merger.

    Any shares of Titan common stock and cash that remain undistributed 180 days
after the effective date of the merger will be delivered to Titan on demand.
After that time, certificates representing BTG common stock must be surrendered
for exchange to Titan. Titan and BTG, as the surviving corporation of the
merger, will not be liable for any shares of Titan common stock or cash
delivered to a public official under any abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

    If a certificate representing BTG common stock has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the consideration payable under the
merger agreement when the claimant submits an affidavit of loss, theft or
destruction, and, if required by Titan, posts a bond as indemnity against any
claim that may be made later with respect to the lost certificate.

FEES AND EXPENSES

    Except with respect to the fees and expenses (other than attorneys' fees)
associated with this proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement
of which it is a part, and the filings required under the HSR Act and any
applicable foreign antitrust law or regulation, which will be shared equally,
Titan and BTG have agreed that each will pay its own expenses incurred in
connection with the merger agreement, whether or not the merger is consummated.

    BTG has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. to solicit
proxies from BTG shareholders in connection with the merger. Georgeson
Shareholder Communications may contact holders of shares of BTG common stock by
mail, telephone, telex, telegraph, e-mail and personal interview and may request
brokers, dealers and other nominee stockholders to forward material relating to
the merger to beneficial owners of shares of BTG common stock. BTG has agreed to
pay Georgeson Shareholder Communications reasonable and customary compensation
for these services in addition to reimbursing Georgeson Shareholder
Communications for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. BTG has agreed to
indemnify Georgeson Shareholder Communications against certain liabilities and
expenses in connection with the merger, including certain liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws. BTG also has agreed to reimburse brokers, dealers,
commercial banks and trust companies and

other nominees, upon request, for customary clerical and mailing expenses
incurred by them in forwarding offering materials to their customers.

    Titan has retained First Union National Bank as the exchange agent. Titan
has agreed to pay the exchange agent reasonable and customary compensation for
its services in connection with the merger, has agreed to reimburse the exchange
agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and has agreed to indemnify the
exchange agent against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws.

    Except as described above, Titan has not agreed to pay any fees or
commissions to any broker, dealer or other person for soliciting proxies
pursuant to the merger.

                         TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The following description of the merger agreement describes the material
terms of the merger agreement. The complete text of the merger agreement is
attached as ANNEX A to this proxy statement/ prospectus and is incorporated into
this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. All BTG shareholders are urged to
read the entire merger agreement carefully.

THE MERGER

    GENERALLY

    The merger agreement provides that T T Acquisition Corp. will be merged with
and into BTG. Upon completion of the merger, BTG will continue as the "surviving
corporation" and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Titan.

    THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

    The merger will be completed and become effective when the articles of
merger are filed with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of
Virginia or at such other time as specified in the articles of merger. Titan and
BTG anticipate that the merger will be completed no later than the third
business day after all of the conditions to the merger contained in the merger
agreement are satisfied or, where permissible, waived.

    ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

    The articles of incorporation and bylaws of BTG will each be amended and
restated at the completion of the merger in the forms attached as exhibits to
the plan of merger. The plan of merger, including the forms of articles of
incorporation and bylaws of BTG to be effective upon completion of the merger,
is attached as ANNEX B. Please review this document carefully.

    DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF BTG AFTER THE MERGER

    The directors of T T Acquisition Corp. will be the initial directors of BTG
as the surviving corporation of the merger, and will serve until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of T T Acquisition Corp.
will be the initial officers of BTG as the surviving corporation of the merger,
subject to the authority of the board of directors of the surviving corporation,
as provided by Virginia law and the bylaws of the surviving corporation.

    MANNER AND BASIS OF CONVERTING SHARES OF BTG COMMON STOCK INTO TITAN COMMON
     STOCK AND OTHER CONSIDERATION IN THE MERGER

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, upon completion of the merger, each
share of BTG common stock will be converted into the right to receive a
combination of shares of Titan common stock and cash as described above under
"THE MERGER--THE EXCHANGE RATIO." The merger consideration will not be payable
in respect of shares of BTG common stock held by a subsidiary of BTG or by Titan
or any subsidiary of Titan immediately prior to the completion of the merger.

    Titan will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of its
common stock in the merger. Instead, each former BTG shareholder who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Titan common stock by virtue of
the merger (after aggregating all fractional shares of Titan common stock

that otherwise would be received by the stockholder) will receive cash (rounded
to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying:

    - that fraction of a share of Titan common stock to which such person is
      entitled by virtue of the merger (after aggregating all fractional shares
      of Titan common stock that otherwise would be received by such person), by

    - the closing sale price of one share of Titan common stock on the New York
      Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape (as reported in the Wall Street
      Journal or, if not reported therein, any other authoritative source) on
      the trading day immediately preceding the effective date of completion of
      the merger.

    The merger agreement provides that, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date of completion of the merger, the exchange agent will mail to each
record holder of a certificate or certificates, that, immediately prior to the
completion of the merger represented outstanding shares of BTG common stock, a
letter of transmittal and instructions for use in exchanging BTG common stock
certificates for the combination of Titan common stock certificates and cash,
including any cash payable instead of any fractional share of Titan common
stock. In addition, the merger agreement contemplates that, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the exchange agent receives back from the record
holder of shares of BTG common stock the BTG common stock certificate, the
letter of transmittal and any other documents that are required by the letter of
transmittal, the record holder will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration in the form of a certificate or certificates representing the
appropriate number of shares of Titan common stock together with the aggregate
amount of cash payable to the holder, including any cash payable instead of any
fractional share.

    After the completion of the merger, until it is surrendered and exchanged,
each certificate that previously evidenced BTG common stock will be deemed to
evidence the right to receive the combination of shares of Titan common stock
and cash payable, including any cash payable instead of any fractional share of
Titan common stock. Titan will not pay dividends or other distributions on any
shares of Titan common stock to be issued in exchange for any BTG common stock
certificate that is not surrendered until the BTG common stock certificate is
properly surrendered, as provided in the merger agreement. No interest will be
paid on any cash to be paid upon the surrender and exchange of certificates of
BTG common stock.

TREATMENT OF BTG STOCK OPTIONS AND BTG STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

    At the effective time of the merger, Titan will assume all outstanding BTG
stock options, other than those options granted under BTG's Directors Stock
Option Plan, which, to the extent not exercised before the effective time of the
merger, will be terminated and be of no further effect. As of September 18,
2001, there were outstanding options to purchase 1,564,109 shares of BTG common
stock under BTG's employee stock option plan, all of which, to the extent not
exercised prior to the effective date of the merger, are to be assumed by Titan.
Each assumed option will be converted in the merger into an option to purchase
shares of Titan common stock using the same exchange ratio that is applicable to
BTG common stock in the merger, then rounded down to the nearest whole share.
The exercise price per share of Titan common stock issuable under the assumed
options will equal the exercise price per share of BTG stock issuable under the
applicable option immediately before the effective time of the merger, divided
by the exchange ratio, then rounded up to the nearest cent. Except for the
number of shares issuable and the exercise price for each assumed option, the
assumed options will remain subject to the same terms and conditions that were
in effect before the merger. The assumption of the options by Titan will not
affect the vesting of the assumed options, although BTG options that provided
for vesting upon a "change of control" will vest at the effective time of the
merger. All options granted under BTG's 1995 employee stock option plan on or
after December 17,

1998 provide for 100% vesting upon a change of control and, accordingly, will
fully vest and become exercisable at the effective time of the merger.

    Titan will not assume any BTG stock purchase rights in the merger. Under the
terms of the merger agreement, upon the completion of the merger each
outstanding BTG stock purchase right that has been issued pursuant to BTG's
stock purchase plans or otherwise that has not been exercised before the
effective time of the merger will be terminated and the BTG stock purchase plans
will be terminated in accordance with their terms.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    The merger agreement contains a number of customary representations and
warranties relating to, among other things, aspects of the respective businesses
and assets of each of the parties and their ability to complete the merger. The
representations and warranties of each party will expire upon completion of the
merger.

CONDUCT OF BTG'S BUSINESS BEFORE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER

    The merger agreement contemplates that, until the completion of the merger,
each of BTG and its subsidiaries will conduct its operations in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and will use reasonable efforts
to preserve intact its present business organization and its relationships with
customers, suppliers and others having business relationships with it. The
merger agreement also contemplates that, until completion of the merger, neither
BTG nor any of its subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent of
Titan:

    - declare, accrue, set aside or pay any dividend or make any other
      distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of BTG or any
      subsidiary of BTG, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise reacquire any
      outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of BTG or any
      subsidiary of BTG;

    - sell, issue, grant or authorize the issuance or grant of any capital
      stock, option, call, warrant, right, instrument or obligation that is or

      the merger, BTG may issue shares of common stock pursuant to BTG stock
      options or BTG stock purchase rights outstanding);

    - amend or waive any of its rights under, or accelerate the vesting under,
      any provision of any outstanding option, warrant or restricted stock
      purchase agreement or otherwise modify any of the terms of any outstanding

      claims under, any contract with obligations in excess of $250,000 to which
      BTG is a party;

    - acquire, or agree to acquire by merger, consolidation or purchase of

    - waive any material benefits of, or agree to modify in any respect, any
      confidentiality, standstill or similar agreements to which BTG or any
      subsidiary is a party;

    - incur or guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money, issue or sell any
      debt securities or warrants or rights to acquire any debt securities,
      guarantee any debt securities issued by another entity, enter into any
      "keep well" or other agreement to maintain any financial statement
      condition of another person or enter into any agreement having similar
      economic effect to any of the above (except for borrowings in the ordinary
      course of business) or make any loans, advances or capital contributions
      to another person, other than travel and payroll advances to employees in

REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THE MERGER

    Titan and BTG are required to use reasonable efforts to make all filings
required under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign antitrust laws or
regulations applicable to the transaction and to use reasonable efforts to take
all actions necessary to complete the merger.

LIMITATION ON BTG'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER ACQUISITION PROPOSALS

    BTG has agreed that, except in the circumstances described below, it will
not, directly or indirectly:

    - solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission
      or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or take any
      action that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
      Proposal;

    - furnish any information regarding BTG or its subsidiaries to any person
      other than Titan in connection with or in response to any Acquisition
      Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest that could lead to an
      Acquisition Proposal;

    - engage in discussions or negotiations with any person other than Titan
      with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;

    - approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or

    - enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract
      contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

    However, BTG or BTG's board of directors is not prohibited from complying
with the provisions of Rule 14e-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or
furnishing nonpublic information regarding BTG or any subsidiary of BTG to, or
entering into discussions with, any person in response to a Superior Proposal
(as defined below) if:

    - neither BTG nor any of its representatives has violated any of the above
      restrictions;

    - BTG's board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with
      BTG's outside legal counsel, that such action is required in order for
      BTG's board of directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to BTG
      under applicable law and that such action is reasonably likely to lead to
      a Superior Proposal;

    - at least two business days prior to furnishing any nonpublic information
      to, or entering into discussions with, such person, BTG gives Titan
      written notice of the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal
      and of BTG's intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
      discussions with, such party;

    - at least two business days prior to furnishing any nonpublic information
      to the party making the Superior Proposal, BTG furnishes such nonpublic
      information to Titan (to the extent such nonpublic information has not
      been previously furnished by BTG to Titan); and

    - BTG receives from such party an executed confidentiality agreement
      containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
      nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such party by or on
      behalf of BTG.

    BTG must promptly, and in any event within twenty-four hours after receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or indication of interest that could lead
to an Acquisition Proposal or request for nonpublic information, advise Titan
orally and in writing of the proposal, inquiry or request, the identity of the
person making the proposal, inquiry or request and the terms thereof. BTG must
keep Titan fully informed as to the status of any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, indication of interest or request and any modification or proposed
modification thereto.

    Under the terms of the merger agreement, BTG agreed to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any person that related to
any Acquisition Proposal.

    In addition, at any time prior to the completion of the merger, BTG's board
of directors may withhold, withdraw or modify its recommendations that BTG
shareholders approve the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger if:

    - an unsolicited, bona fide written offer is made to BTG by a third party
      for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of substantial
      assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including without limitation by
      way of a tender offer) or similar transaction, and such offer is not
      withdrawn;

    - BTG's board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
      Quarterdeck or another nationally recognized financial advisor) that such
      offer constitutes a Superior Proposal and is reasonably likely to be
      consummated;

    - BTG's board of directors determines in good faith, after having received
      the advice of BTG's outside legal counsel, that, in light of the Superior
      Proposal, the withdrawal or modification of the recommendations is
      required in order for BTG's board of directors to comply with its
      fiduciary obligations to BTG under applicable law;

    - the recommendations are not withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
      Titan at any time prior to two business days after Titan receives written
      notice from BTG confirming that BTG's board of directors has determined
      that such offer is a Superior Proposal and providing to Titan a copy of
      any such Superior Proposal;

    - for a period of two business days after providing written notice to Titan
      of that determination, BTG, if requested by Titan, must negotiate in good
      faith with Titan to make sufficient adjustments to the terms and
      conditions of the merger agreement as would enable the BTG board of
      directors to continue to recommend the merger with Titan on those adjusted
      terms;

    - BTG shall have released Titan from the provisions of any "standstill" or
      similar agreement restricting Titan from acquiring securities of BTG; and

    - neither BTG nor any of its representatives shall have violated any of the
      restrictions set forth above.

    Pursuant to the merger agreement, BTG has agreed not to release any person
(other than Titan) from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar agreement to which BTG is a party. BTG has also agreed
that it will use reasonable best efforts to enforce each such agreement if Titan
should request that BTG do so. Under the terms of the merger agreement, BTG has
agreed to promptly request each person that has executed, within 12 months prior
to the merger agreement, a

confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement in connection with an
Acquisition Transaction (as defined below) to return all confidential
information furnished to such person by or on behalf of BTG.

    An "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication
of interest (other than an offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest by
Titan) contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction, which
is defined to include:

    - any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance
      of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, tender offer,
      exchange offer or other similar transaction in which BTG or any subsidiary
      of BTG is a constituent corporation, any person or "group" (as defined in
      the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of persons directly
      or indirectly acquires beneficial or record ownership of securities
      representing more than 20% of the outstanding securities of any class of
      voting securities of BTG or any subsidiary of BTG, or BTG, or any
      subsidiary of BTG, issues securities representing more than 20% of the
      outstanding securities of any class of its voting securities;

    - any direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license,
      acquisition or disposition of any business or businesses or of assets or
      rights that constitute or account for 20% or more of the consolidated net
      revenues, net income or assets of BTG or any subsidiary of BTG; or

    - any liquidation or dissolution of BTG or any subsidiary of BTG.

    A "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by
a third party for a merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
substantial assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including without
limitation by way of a tender offer) or similar transaction with respect to BTG
on terms that the board of directors of BTG determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and Quarterdeck or another nationally
recognized independent financial advisor, if accepted, is reasonably likely to
be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects
of the merger and the person making the merger, and would, if consummated, be in
the best interests of BTG when compared to the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. However, any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior
Proposal" if any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated
by such offer is not committed or is not, in the good faith judgment of BTG,
reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

    The merger agreement contemplates that the employees of BTG and any of its
subsidiaries who are employees of Titan or any of its subsidiaries, including
the surviving corporations after the completion of the merger, will be eligible
to continue to participate in the health, vacation and other employee benefit
plans of the employing Titan entity. In the event the employing Titan entity
terminates any such health, vacation or other employee plan at any time, such
employees will be eligible to participate in other Titan health, vacation or
other employee benefit plans to substantially the same extent as employees of
Titan in similar positions with the same seniority or years of service, and such
seniority or years of service with BTG will be recognized for eligibility and
vesting purposes.

      rescinded; provided, however, if Titan's or BTG's counsel does not render

exercise ownership rights with respect to the stock of the surviving
corporation. As used in the merger agreement, "material adverse effect" as it

capitalization, assets, liabilities, operations or financial performance of
Titan and its significant subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of
Titan to complete the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or to perform any obligations thereunder before the termination

or be taken into account in determining whether there has been a material
adverse affect on Titan, BTG or any subsidiary of BTG: (i) any event,
circumstance or other matter resulting from the announcement or pendency of the
merger, (ii) any change, in and of itself, in Titan's or BTG's stock price or
trading volume, (iii) any event, circumstance or other matter that results from
changes affecting any of the industries in which Titan, any significant
subsidiary of Titan, BTG or any subsidiary of BTG operate generally or the
United States economy generally (which changes in each case do not
disproportionately affect Titan, any significant subsidiary of Titan, BTG or any
subsidiary of BTG in any material respect) and (iv) any event, circumstance or
other matter that results from changes affecting general worldwide economic or
capital market conditions (which changes in each case do not disproportionately
affect Titan, any significant subsidiary of Titan, BTG or any subsidiary of BTG
in any material respect).

      failure of the merger to have been completed on or before such date is
      attributable to a failure on the part of a party to perform any material

      or

    - there is a breach of BTG's obligations described in the section entitled
      "LIMITATION ON BTG'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER OTHER ACQUISITION PROPOSALS"

      and BTG agrees to waive this condition, but Titan and T T Acquisition
      Corp. refuse to waive such condition.

    If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the provisions
described above in this section, the merger agreement will become void and of no
effect, with no liability on the part of Titan or BTG, except as described below
under "TERMINATION FEE; EXPENSES."

TERMINATION FEE; EXPENSES

    BTG has agreed to pay to Titan a termination fee in an amount equal to
$5,000,000, if the merger agreement is terminated and any of the following
additional circumstances exist:

    - The merger agreement is terminated by Titan because a Triggering Event has
      occurred; or

    - The merger agreement is terminated by either Titan or BTG because (x) the
      merger has not been completed on or before (A) December 18, 2001, if this
      proxy statement/prospectus is not "reviewed" by the SEC and there is no
      extension of any waiting period or similar review period in connection
      with the notifications required under the HSR Act or any applicable
      foreign antitrust laws or regulations, or (B) March 18, 2002, if the SEC
      does conduct a review of this proxy statement/prospectus or a waiting
      period or similar review period is extended under the HSR Act or any
      applicable foreign antitrust laws or regulations, or (y) BTG shareholders
      do not vote at the BTG special meeting to approve the merger agreement,
      the plan of merger and the merger, and:

       (1) at or prior to the termination of the merger agreement, an
           Acquisition Proposal is disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or
           made; and

       (2) within five months following the termination of the merger agreement,
           BTG enters into a definitive agreement related to, or consummates, an
           Acquisition Transaction with any person.

    Titan has agreed to pay BTG a termination fee of $1,000,000 in cash if all
of the conditions precedent to Titan's obligations to complete the merger other
than Titan's receipt of approvals from the requisite lenders under its credit
facility have been obtained, and the merger agreement is terminated as a result
of Titan's failure to secure these required lender approvals by the close of
business on the fifth business day before the date of the BTG special meeting.

    The merger agreement provides that all fees and expenses, other than any
termination fee, incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are to be paid by the party
incurring such expenses. However, Titan and BTG are required to share equally
all fees and expenses, other than attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with
the filing, printing and mailing of the registration statement of which this
proxy statement/prospectus is a part, the preliminary proxy statement/prospectus
and any amendments or supplements to the preceding documents (if required), the
filing by any of the parties to the merger agreement of reports and forms
relating to the transaction under the HSR Act and the filing of any notice or
other document under any applicable foreign antitrust law or regulation.

AMENDMENTS TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT

    The merger agreement and the plan of merger may be amended, modified or
waived by Titan's or BTG's board of directors at any time (whether before or
after approval of the merger agreement and plan of merger by BTG shareholders)
if the amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by BTG and Titan or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective. However, after the approval of the merger
agreement, the plan of merger and the merger by the shareholders of BTG, no
amendment may be made which by law requires further approval of BTG shareholders
without the further approval of BTG shareholders.

                              THE VOTING AGREEMENT

    The following description of the voting agreement describes the material
terms of the voting agreement. A complete copy of the voting agreement is
attached as ANNEX C to this proxy statement/ prospectus and is incorporated into
this proxy statement/prospectus by reference. All stockholders are urged to read
the voting agreement carefully.

    On September 19, 2001, as an essential condition and inducement to Titan and
T T Acquisition Corp. entering into the merger agreement, Titan, T T Acquisition
Corp. and five BTG directors and executive officers, referred to as the BTG
Principal Shareholders, entered into a voting agreement. Under the voting
agreement, the BTG Principal Shareholders have agreed to vote, or cause the
record holders of their BTG securities to vote, the BTG securities beneficially
owned by them as of September 19, 2001, and any other BTG securities acquired by
them after September 19, 2001, in the following manner:

       - in favor of the merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger;

       - in favor of other actions contemplated by the merger agreement in
         connection with any meeting of, or solicitation of consents from, BTG
         shareholders where such matters are submitted to a vote of BTG
         shareholders;

       - against approval or adoption of any extraordinary corporate transaction
         or Acquisition Proposal (in each case, other than the merger);

       - against approval or adoption of resolutions which would have the effect
         of preventing or delaying completion of the merger or BTG from
         performing its obligations under the merger agreement; and

       - against any other action that would constitute a breach of any
         representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of BTG contained in
         the merger agreement.

    The BTG common stock beneficially owned by the BTG Principal Shareholders
represented approximately 23.1% of the shares of BTG common stock outstanding as
of September 18, 2001. The BTG Principal Stockholders consist of the following
persons:

       - Dr. Edward H. Bersoff;

       - Marilynn D. Bersoff;

       - Donald M. Wallach;

       - John Littley, III; and

       - Linda E. Hill.

    Under the voting agreements, each BTG Principal Shareholder delivered an
irrevocable proxy to Titan to vote the BTG common stock or other BTG securities
owned of record by such BTG Principal Shareholder on September 19, 2001 or which
such BTG Principal Shareholder acquires after September 19, 2001 to approve the
merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger, as described under
"IRREVOCABLE PROXIES" below.

    The BTG Principal Shareholders have agreed not to take any of the following
actions until the effective time of the merger or, if earlier terminated, the
termination of the voting agreements, and to use their reasonable efforts not to
allow any of their representatives to take any of the following actions:

       - initiate, solicit, facilitate or encourage the submission of an
         Acquisition Proposal for BTG;

       - engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect to an
         Acquisition Proposal for BTG;

       - furnish any information regarding BTG or any BTG subsidiary to any
         person in connection with or in response to any Acquisition Proposal
         for BTG or to an inquiry or indication of interest that could
         reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

       - execute any other proxies or other voting arrangements with respect to
         BTG capital stock or rights to acquire BTG capital stock; or

       - transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of capital stock
         beneficially owned by the BTG Principal Shareholders.

    The voting agreement will terminate on the earlier to occur of the effective
time of the merger or on the date the merger agreement is validly terminated.

    IRREVOCABLE PROXIES

    Under the voting agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Titan's
entering into the merger agreement, each BTG Principal Shareholder granted an
irrevocable proxy dated September 19, 2001 to Titan, with power of substitution
and resubstitution. Under the terms of each proxy, Titan has the authority to
vote the BTG common stock or other shares of BTG securities owned of record by
the applicable BTG Principal Stockholder as of September 19, 2001, together with
all other shares of BTG common stock or other BTG securities the BTG Principal
Shareholder acquires after September 19, 2001, in favor of the approval of the
merger agreement, the plan of merger and the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Each proxy authorizes Titan to vote these
shares at any meeting of shareholders of BTG, or in connection with any
solicitation of written consents from shareholders of BTG, called or solicited
for the purpose of voting on the merger agreement, plan of merger and the merger
and the other actions contemplated by the merger agreement. Each proxy is
coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. The proxy and the rights contained
in it will terminate upon the termination of the voting agreements.

                          INFORMATION RELATING TO BTG

BUSINESS

    BACKGROUND

    BTG is an information systems and technical services company. It provides
complete solutions to a broad range of the complex systems needs of the U.S.
government and its agencies and departments and other commercial and state and
local government customers. Since BTG was founded in 1982, it has been providing
highly sophisticated software-based solutions to its customers, especially those
in the U.S. government defense intelligence community.

    BTG's headquarters and executive offices are located at 3877 Fairfax Ridge
Road, Fairfax, Virginia 22030-7448, and its telephone number is (703) 383-8000.

    BTG OPERATIONS

    BTG's services and solutions are focused on four principal areas:

    - ANALYSIS AND CONSULTING--BTG helps its clients manage their knowledge and
      information resources. BTG provides modeling and simulation, information
      fusion, and competitive intelligence to customers that include the U.S.
      Department of Defense ("DOD"), and the Board of Education in Okaloosa
      County, Florida.

    - SOLUTIONS DEVELOPMENT--BTG's engineers provide solutions by combining
      BTG's proven business processes and its strategic partnerships with
      leading technology firms like The SAS Institute ("SAS"), Microsoft
      Corporation, Peregrine Systems and Cisco Systems. BTG's customers in this
      area include: the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, Defense
      Advanced Research Projects Agency, Federal Aviation Administration
      ("FAA"), and Verizon.

    - SYSTEMS INTEGRATION--BTG analyzes its customers' business processes,
      recommends proven commercial off-the-shelf products, and uses its
      technical expertise to integrate them into existing hardware and software
      resources. BTG's customers include the Office of Naval Intelligence and
      the National Science Foundation.

    - OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT--BTG provides clients with technical experts who
      provide a full range of enterprise management services, including hands-on
      systems installation and maintenance, management of network operations
      centers, help desk support, and training in the efficient use of the new
      systems. BTG's customers include the U.S. Army Communications and
      Electronics Command, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Joint
      Chiefs of Staff, and the FAA.

    Prior to fiscal 1999, BTG operated a division that was responsible for
reselling computer hardware and software products (the "Product Reselling
Business"), principally to the U.S. government. In February 1998, BTG entered
into an asset purchase agreement with GTSI Corp. under which BTG completed the
sale to GTSI of substantially all of the operating assets, contracts and
customer orders of the Product Reselling Business. Additionally, during fiscal
2000, the last two product reselling contracts held by BTG were terminated. As a
result of exiting the Product Reselling Business, BTG does not expect to have
any significant product revenues in the future. In fact, during fiscal 2001 and
2000, the amount of revenues from the sale of products decreased by over 84% and
69%, respectively.

    BTG has almost two decades of experience providing expert services and
technology-based solutions to its customers. It applies its experience and
technical knowledge in areas that range from air combat to educational
accountability, from counter-terrorism to data warehousing. BTG's proven
business processes have become the foundation of expert practice areas in:

    - Intelligence Analysis and Dissemination;

    - Geographic Information Systems;

    - Network Engineering and Enterprise Management;

    - Data Management;

    - Domestic Emergency Preparedness;

    - Modeling, Simulation and Training; and

    - Technology in the Law.

    CUSTOMERS AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT

    A substantial portion of BTG's revenues come from contracts with various
agencies of the U.S. government, including all four armed forces, the Defense
Intelligence Agency, the General Services Administration, the National Security
Agency, and many of the civilian U.S. government agencies such as the FAA and
the Departments of Commerce and Justice. In addition, BTG has performed projects
for, or supplied computer hardware, software and integrated systems to, a number
of commercial customers, as well as several state and local governments. As of
June 30, 2001, BTG was providing services under approximately 500 active U.S.
government contracts.

    In fiscal 2001 and 2000, approximately 79% and 83% respectively, of BTG's
revenues came from U.S. government contracts. The following table sets forth
BTG's estimates of the sources of its revenues in the last two fiscal years:

                                                                   FISCAL YEARS

    BTG offers its customers a full range of support services for the systems
its develop, and strives to understand thoroughly the environment of the
end-user of its systems. Its employees work directly with customers throughout
each project to ensure that the solutions it provides satisfies its customers'
needs. Of major importance to BTG are timely implementation and rapid
assistance. BTG provides rapid support and backup, by telephone hotline and in
person, for systems in use throughout the world. Its revenues are highly
dependent on the U.S. government's demand for the services it offers. Changes in
the structure, composition and/or buying patterns of the U.S. government could
affect BTG's future operations.

    BACKLOG

    BTG's total contract backlog is only a portion of its total contract
capacity (I.E., the maximum amount that customers could purchase under their
contracts with BTG) and represents management's estimate of the aggregate
revenues that will be earned by BTG over the life of all of its contracts,
including option periods. Because many of its contracts are multi-year contracts
and contracts with option years, total contract backlog represents revenues
expected to be realized over a number of years into the future. Estimated total
contract backlog as of June 30, 2001 and 2000 was $605.3 million and

$428.8 million, respectively. BTG differentiates among the following four types
of backlog, which together constitute total backlog:

    - FUNDED BACKLOG is negotiated and authorized backlog for which the customer
      has secured funding and has indicated that funding is available to BTG for
      billing. BTG had $136.0 million of Funded Backlog as of June 30, 2001.

    - AUTHORIZED BUT NOT FUNDED (UNFUNDED) BACKLOG is negotiated and authorized
      backlog for which the customer has not secured funding. BTG had
      $101.0 million of Authorized but Not Funded Backlog as of June 30, 2001.

    - OPTIONS BACKLOG is the total value of contract options that have been
      negotiated, but for which the customer has not authorized work to begin.
      BTG had $169.4 million of Options Backlog as of June 30, 2001.

    - IDIQ BACKLOG is the estimated total value of revenue expected to be
      realized over the remaining life of an existing indefinite
      delivery-indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") contract. Management estimates this
      amount and periodically adjusts the estimate upward or downward based upon
      actual experience under each specific IDIQ contract. BTG had
      $198.9 million of IDIQ Backlog as of June 30, 2001.

    The preceding information regarding contract backlog and future revenues to
be derived therefrom is forward-looking and is subject to certain risks and
uncertainties including, but not limited to, the inherent difficulty of
predicting future contract potential, a dependence on the continued funding of
U.S. government programs and contract procurements, and the risk of contract
termination.

    COMPETITIVE FACTORS

    BTG believes that it has successfully functioned in the U.S. government
information technology market since its inception. This market is generally
characterized by significant barriers to entry, including highly structured
procurement rules and procedures and relatively long sales cycles (often several
years). In addition, many contracts in the defense and intelligence areas
require that employees have high-level security clearances. BTG believes the
following factors enable it to compete effectively in the U.S. government
information technology market, as well as the commercial and state and local
government arenas.

    - TEAMING AGREEMENTS--An important factor in BTG's ability to maintain its
      competitive stance is its ability to enter into teaming relationships, in
      which it may be either a prime contractor or subcontractor. BTG maintains
      teaming relationships with major U.S. government contractors, including
      General Dynamics, Raytheon, Litton, and Lockheed Martin Corporation. These
      arrangements enable BTG to bid on and participate in a greater number of
      increasingly large and complex procurement projects. Teaming relationships
      have enabled BTG to secure several U.S. government contracts during the
      past several years.

    - STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS--BTG has entered into a number of strategic
      alliances with technology companies including SAS, Microsoft, and
      Peregrine Systems.

    - SECURITY CLEARANCES--Many of BTG's U.S. government contracts require it to
      maintain facility security clearances complying with DOD requirements,
      including Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities for the
      performance of classified work under its contracts. Obtaining necessary
      certifications for this type of space is costly and time consuming. As of
      June 30, 2001, approximately 1,500 of BTG's employees possessed secret or
      top secret security clearances, which are required for the performance of
      certain of its contracts. None of BTG's contracts has ever been terminated
      for security reasons.

    - DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS--BTG provides services to a diverse
      group of customers: 59% percent of BTG's fiscal year 2001 revenues were
      from defense and intelligence agencies; 20% were from federal civilian
      agencies; and 21% were from commercial and state and local government
      customers.

    In seeking to provide a broad range of services and products that address
the complete information technology needs of its customers, BTG participates, to
varying degrees, in multiple areas of the information technology market,
including markets for systems engineering, development and integration services.
Within each area, BTG competes against different firms of varying sizes, with
different specializations and skills. Each of the areas in which BTG operates is
competitive. The number and size of competitors vary among operating groups and
within the individual divisions of each group. Frequently, the number and
identity of competitors vary even from program to program within a given
business area. Many of BTG's competitors are significantly larger and have
greater financial resources than BTG. Some of these competitors are part of
large, diversified companies that have access to the financial resources of
their parent companies.

    BTG believes that the principal competitive factors in providing information
systems and technical services are management capability, technical
understanding, customer satisfaction, past contract performance, personnel
qualifications, including security clearances, and price. During its recent
history, BTG has been very successful in securing the exercise of contract
option years in its services business. BTG believes this to be attributable to
the strength of its past contract performance and its competitive prices.
Further, its senior management team has an extensive number of years of
industry-specific technical and managerial experience. As a result, BTG believes
it is able to compete favorably on each of the principal competitive factors
within the services business.

    U.S. government contracts are periodically subjected to the competitive
bidding process, and BTG has generally been successful in retaining its
incumbent business. In addition, a significant number of the opportunities BTG
pursues are large dollar value procurements. In such cases, in order to enhance
its ability to compete, BTG often forms teams or joint ventures with one or more
firms possessing complementary technical skills, which firms may be BTG's
competitors in other procurements.

    CERTAIN REGULATORY MATTERS

    The nature of BTG's business subjects it to various regulatory restrictions
and limitations, including those set forth as follows:

    - U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS--U.S. government
      contractors are commonly subject to various audits and investigations by
      U.S. government agencies. Among the agencies that oversee or enforce
      contract performance are the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), the
      Inspectors General of the various departments, the Defense Criminal
      Investigative Service, the General Accounting Office and the Department of
      Justice. These audits and investigations involve the review of a
      contractor's performance on its contracts, as well as its pricing
      practices, costs and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and
      standards. The DCAA generally audits cost-reimbursable contracts to verify
      that costs have been properly charged to the U.S. government. Final audits
      by the DCAA have been completed for fiscal years through 1998. BTG has not
      experienced any material adverse effects as a result of these completed
      audits. Management does not expect the completion of future audits on open
      years 1999 through 2001 to have a material adverse effect on BTG's
      consolidated financial position.

    - EXPORT REGULATIONS--United States law and regulations issued by various
      agencies of the U.S. government, including but not limited to the
      Departments of Commerce, Treasury and State, restrict and regulate the
      export of technology as well as goods and commodities provided by United
      States businesses to foreign entities and controlled foreign subsidiaries
      and affiliates.

      BTG is subject to certain of these regulations with respect to technology
      developed by BTG that is sold to non-U.S. customers.

    EMPLOYEES

    As of June 30, 2001, BTG had 1,923 employees on staff, of which 1,758 were
employed in technical or managerial positions. Management believes that BTG is
competitive in hiring and retaining qualified personnel. BTG emphasizes both
technical and leadership training as well as career development assistance for
all of its employees.

    BTG has a values-based culture and emphasizes integrity, teamwork, and
customer focus and satisfaction. BTG requires all of its employees to complete
training in, and to certify that they understand and will adhere to, BTG's
standards of conduct as described in its written code of ethics.

    As of June 30, 2001, 35 of BTG's employees were represented by a labor
union. BTG considers its relations with its employees to be good and it has not
experienced any significant labor problems.

MARKET FOR BTG'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS

    BTG's common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market's National
Market under the symbol "BTGI." The stock has been publicly traded since
December 1994. The high and low sale closing prices per share of common stock
for each quarter of fiscal 2001 and 2000 and the first and second quarters of
fiscal 2002 are as follows:

    BTG has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and is currently
prohibited from doing so under its line of credit facility. It is the present
policy of BTG to retain earnings to finance the growth and development of its
business and, therefore, BTG does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its
common stock in the foreseeable future.

    BTG has authorized 20,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. At October 5, 2001, 8,984,260 shares of common stock were
outstanding. No preferred shares have been issued. BTG had approximately 256
shareholders of record on October 5, 2001.

RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES

    On December 1, 2000, BTG sold an aggregate of 778 shares of common stock to
a senior vice president of BTG for an aggregate cash purchase price of
$4,909.18. The issuance of the securities was made in reliance upon the
exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and
Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The recipient of the securities represented
his intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view
to or for distribution. The senior vice president had adequate access to
information about BTG through his relationship with BTG.

BTG MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
  OPERATIONS

    You should read the following discussion together with BTG's consolidated
financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements that
are included in this proxy statement/prospectus. Except for the historical
information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. BTG's future results could
differ materially from those discussed here.

    NATURE OF BTG'S BUSINESS

    BTG is an information systems and technical services company. For nearly two
decades, BTG has developed and provided solutions to the complex systems needs
of the U.S. government, as well as to other commercial and state and local
government customers. BTG's current services and solutions are focused on four
principal areas of competency: (i) analysis and consulting; (ii) solutions
development; (iii) systems integration; and (iv) operations and support.

    Since its founding, BTG has provided highly sophisticated software-based
solutions to its customers, especially to those in the U.S. government defense
intelligence community. More recently, BTG has seen that the skills it has
developed in working with U.S. government agencies are increasingly useful for
commercial and state and local government customers and, in this regard, BTG has
seen that a larger percentage of its revenues has been derived from this
customer set. BTG's proven business processes have become the foundation of
expert practice areas in Information Management, Geographic Information Systems,
Technology in Schools, Emergency Management, Airborne Systems, Data Warehousing,
Modeling and Simulation, Enterprise Support, Client Care Services, Information
and Network Security, and Network Design and Architecture.

    BTG has an experienced management team and 1,923 employees at June 30, 2001,
with approximately 2,200 technical and professional degrees and certifications.
Due to the classified nature of much of the work that BTG does in the U.S.
government defense and intelligence markets, the majority of its employees have
received secret or top secret security clearances from the U.S. government.
BTG's customers include the four U.S. armed forces, many of the U.S.
intelligence and civilian agencies, a variety of commercial entities including
Verizon, Federal Express, and NCR, and a number of state and local governments
in Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. BTG is headquartered in
Fairfax, Virginia and has employees in over 93 locations worldwide.

    REVENUES

    Historically, BTG has earned revenues from both contract activities and
product sales. Contract revenue, earned from BTG's services and solutions
business, is typically less seasonal than product sales, but fluctuates from
month to month based on contract delivery schedules. Contract revenue is
typically characterized by lower direct costs than product sales, yet generally
requires a higher relative level of infrastructure support. Year-to-year
increases in contract revenue have generally resulted from (i) increases in
volume, driven by additional work requirements under existing contracts,
(ii) new contract awards, and (iii) focused acquisitions. BTG's operating
performance is affected by both the number and type of contracts held, the
timing of the installation or delivery of BTG's services and products, and the
relative margins of the services performed or products sold. In general, BTG
recognizes its highest margins on its most specialized systems engineering and
software development projects and lower margins on sales of commercial
off-the-shelf products.

    In 1997, BTG identified what it believed to be a dramatic change in the
federal product reselling market. The U.S. government's product purchasing
strategy shifted its focus to contract vehicles such as

General Services Administration Schedules, which heavily weigh lowest price as
opposed to best value. As profit margins in the product reselling business began
to shrink during fiscal 1998, BTG realized that only the largest product
resellers could generate the volume of sales required to compensate for the
decreasing product margins. Accordingly, on February 12, 1998, BTG entered into
an asset purchase agreement with GTSI, a large reseller of computer products in
the U.S. government market. Under this agreement, BTG sold to GTSI (i) certain
assets, principally inventory and property and equipment and (ii) certain
reselling contracts and related outstanding customer orders associated with
BTG's computer hardware and software reselling operating division (the "GTSI
Transaction"). Additionally, during fiscal 2000, BTG terminated its last two
product reselling contracts and, as a result, expects no significant product
revenues in future periods. It is currently planned that future product revenues
will only be derived from sales that are incidental to BTG's services contracts.

    Total revenue for both fiscal 2001 and 2000 decreased from their respective
prior fiscal years. In fiscal 2001, BTG's revenues decreased by $24.2 million,
or 9.7%, from fiscal 2000 and revenues for fiscal 2000 decreased by
$67.4 million, or 21.3%, from fiscal 1999. These decreases were principally due
to BTG's strategic shift out of the high-volume, low-margin product reselling
business, which resulted in both the GTSI Transaction and the subsequent
termination of two remaining product reselling contracts. Offsetting the
reductions in BTG's product sales were increased revenues in its services and
solutions business. Fiscal 2001 contract revenue increased $13.3 million, or
6.5%, from fiscal 2000, which increased $30.7 million, or 17.7%, over fiscal
1999. The net increase from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to additional contract
wins and extensions from contracts in BTG's existing operating units and from
revenue recognized under contracts acquired in connection with a business
combination in April 2000. These increased business activities were offset by
certain contracts that were completed, most notably the enterprise support
services effort with the U.S. Department of Education for which BTG was not
awarded the follow-on work. Much of the revenue growth experienced by BTG's
existing operating units came from state and local government and commercial
customers. In fiscal 2001, 21% of BTG's total revenue was derived from state and
local government and commercial customers, whereas in fiscal 2000, 17% of
revenues came from these customers.

    Consistent with BTG's strategic business plan of focusing on its core
services and solutions business, its product sales have decreased from fiscal
2000 to fiscal 2001 by $37.5 million, or 83.7%. There was a $98.1 million, or
68.7%, decrease in product sales from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. Included in
fiscal 1999 product sales revenue was $93.6 million generated as a result of
certain contracts that were awarded to BTG's former product reselling business
unit in a prior year, and subcontracted to GTSI as part of the GTSI Transaction
(the "Royalty Contracts"). Pursuant to an agreement entered into as part of the
GTSI Transaction, GTSI assumed substantially all of the future performance
requirements of the Royalty Contracts under a subcontractor agreement and BTG
received a fee of 1% or 2% on total product sales made under such contracts. In
the last quarter of fiscal 1999, BTG entered into a separate agreement with GTSI
and will receive no future revenue from such contracts.

    DIRECT COSTS

    BTG's direct costs, expressed as a percentage of total revenues, decreased
to 66.6% in fiscal 2001, down from 71.0% in fiscal 2000 and 79.4% in fiscal
1999. This is indicative of the decreased proportion of total revenues derived
from product sales, which typically have higher direct costs than do revenues
generated from services contracts.

    Contract costs include the costs of labor, subcontractors, materials, and
other costs directly related to the generation of contract revenue. Contract
costs as a percentage of contract revenue were consistent in fiscal 2001, 2000,
and 1999 at 65.7%, 65.6% and 65.3%, respectively.

    As a percentage of product sales, BTG's cost of product sales was 93.3% in
fiscal 2001, 95.7% in fiscal 2000, and 96.6% in fiscal 1999. In fiscal 1999, the
lower gross margin was primarily due to the

1-2% contractual margin earned from the Royalty Contracts. With no product sales
from the Royalty Contracts in fiscal 2000, BTG would have expected a higher
gross profit margin on product sales than that which was experienced. The
lower-than-anticipated gross margin in fiscal 2000 was principally due to a
$1.0 million addition to the reserve for anticipated warranty costs, which is
included in cost of product sales. This warranty reserve is related to computer
hardware products sold by BTG's former product reselling division prior to the
GTSI Transaction. Excluding this additional warranty reserve, the gross margins
experienced on product sales were consistent in fiscal 2001 and 2000.

    INDIRECT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

    BTG includes the costs of indirect labor, fringe benefits, overhead, sales
and administration, bid and proposal, and research and development in its
indirect, general and administrative expenses. These costs for fiscal 2001
increased by $3.6 million or 6.1%. This increase was primarily due to indirect
costs associated with supporting the business acquired from the April 2000
business combination and from an increase in the overall volume of contract
revenues.

    In fiscal 2000, BTG's indirect, general and administrative costs increased
by $4.7 million, or 8.5%, from fiscal 1999. This was primarily due to indirect
costs associated with supporting the business acquired from the acquisition of
STAC, Inc. and an increase in contract revenues.

    Included in indirect, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001 and
2000 was $677,000 and $492,000, respectively, in employee severance pay. There
was no such expense incurred in fiscal 1999.

    Expressed as a percentage of total revenues, indirect, general and
administrative expenses increased in both fiscal 2001 and 2000 to 28.3% and
24.1%, respectively, up from 17.5% in fiscal 1999. This increase is principally
reflective of the decreased proportion of total revenues derived from product
sales, which typically have lower indirect, general and administrative expenses
than do revenues generated from services contracts. As a percentage of contract
revenue, these costs decreased to 29.2% in fiscal 2001, down from 29.3% and
31.8% in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively.

    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE

    Depreciation expense increased from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 by $347,000,
or 22.9%. This was primarily due to the depreciation of assets acquired from the
business combination in April 2000. The $240,000, or 18.9%, increase from fiscal
1999 to fiscal 2000 was primarily due to BTG's new financial system, acquired in
fiscal 2000, offset by the retirement of certain assets.

    Amortization expense, which includes the amortization of goodwill and other
intangible assets, increased from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 by $450,000, or
64.8%. This was solely due to the goodwill associated with the business
combination consummated in April 2000.

    Amortization expense remained relatively consistent from fiscal 1999 to
fiscal 2000. This was attributable to an increase of $278,000 in fiscal 2000
associated with the STAC acquisition, offset by certain intangible assets that
were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 1999.

    RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

    BTG recognized a restructuring charge of $1.8 million during fiscal 1999.
This resulted from an increase in the estimated restructuring costs accrued
during fiscal 1998 as a result of the divestiture of BTG's former product
reselling division. Specifically, the fiscal 1999 charges related to an
additional write-off of certain assets of the product reselling division and
additional facility costs associated with terminating leases for unused space
previously occupied by the product reselling division. There were no comparable
charges in fiscal 2000 or 2001.

    INTEREST EXPENSE

    The primary component of BTG's interest expense has resulted from the
financing costs on borrowings under its revolving line of credit (the "Credit
Facility"). The Credit Facility has been used historically to fund both BTG's
working capital needs and certain business combinations. In addition to the
interest paid on Credit Facility borrowings, BTG incurred financing costs in
fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 resulting from the issuance of promissory notes
entered into to finance certain acquisitions. Cash used to reduce outstanding
debt was primarily generated from the collection of outstanding receivables and
from proceeds made available from sales of investments. Interest expense for
fiscal 2001 increased by $1.2 million from fiscal 2000 due, in large part, to
the additional debt obtained to finance the business combination BTG consummated
in April 2000, offset by a higher level of collections of existing receivables.
The number of days sales outstanding in BTG's receivables was reduced from 102
at March 31, 2000 to 95 at March 31, 2001. In addition to the higher monthly
average debt outstanding during fiscal 2001, as compared to 2000, interest
expense increased as a result of higher prevailing interest rates in the general
U.S. economy. The effective interest rate paid by BTG in fiscal 2001 was 9.65%,
as compared to 8.38% in fiscal 2000. Interest expense in fiscal 2000 decreased
$2.0 million, or 51.5%, from fiscal 1999. This was due to a significant
reduction in the average balance outstanding under the Credit Facility and
repayment of the promissory notes used to finance the STAC acquisition.

    UNUSUAL CHARGES

    BTG recognized an unusual charge of $1.2 million during fiscal 1999 as a
result of a series of agreements it entered into with GTSI during February 1999
to settle a number of issues that arose subsequent to the GTSI Transaction.
There were no comparable costs in fiscal 2000 or 2001.

    GAIN (LOSS) ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS, NET

    BTG recognized losses on sales of investments in fiscal 2001 of $955,000,
the majority of which resulted from a $905,000 loss on the sale of 1.3 million
shares of common stock BTG held in GTSI. This represented a liquidation of the
remainder of BTG's equity holdings in GTSI, which were originally acquired as a
portion of the consideration received under the GTSI Transaction.

    In fiscal 1999, the gain on sales of investments resulted primarily from the
liquidation of shares BTG held in Cisco Systems Inc., which BTG acquired as a
result of BTG's ownership of the WheelGroup Corporation.

    INCOME TAX EXPENSE

    BTG's effective tax rate was 39.5%, 43.8%, and 36.2% during fiscal 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively. In fiscal 2001, the most significant difference
between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate was due to goodwill
amortization expense, a portion of which is not deductible for income tax
purposes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 was higher than the statutory
Federal income tax rate of 35.0% due principally to an effective state income
tax rate of 4.7% and to certain other costs incurred during fiscal 2000 that
were not deductible for income tax purposes, the largest component of which
related to the amortization expense associated with acquired companies. During
fiscal 1999, BTG realized portions of the net operating losses generated by its
former product reselling division for which a valuation allowance had been
established in fiscal 1998. As a result, the effective income tax rate for
fiscal 1999 was lower than the 45.8% that would otherwise have been calculated.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

    BTG recorded losses of $116,000 in fiscal 2000 and $765,000 in fiscal 1999
from the discontinuance of the non-strategic operations of a retail computer
store. This operation was completely disposed of

during the second quarter of fiscal 2000. BTG did not recognize any losses
associated with this operation in fiscal 2001, and anticipates no future losses
associated with this operation.

    INFLATION

    Approximately 18.0% and 15.8% of BTG's contract revenue for fiscal 2001 and
2000, respectively, were under cost-reimbursement type contracts, under which
inflationary increases are borne by the customer. Although BTG performs on
several multi-year, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts, under which it
bears the risk of inflationary pressures on its costs, to date it has not been
materially adversely affected by inflation. In addition, BTG's product sales
generally have not been affected by inflation.

    REVENUES

    During the three months ended June 30, 2001, BTG had a net increase in
revenue of $5.5 million, or 9.1%, from the three months ended June 30, 2000.
Contract revenue increased $8.0 million, or 14.1%, from the comparable period of
the prior year, while product sales decreased $2.6 million, or 77.4%, from the
same period of the prior year. The increase in contract revenue was primarily
due to revenue generated by new contracts associated with the acquisition of
Research Planning, Inc. ("RPI") offset by certain contracts that were completed,
most notably an enterprise support services effort with a U.S. government
civilian agency for which BTG was not awarded the follow-on work. The decrease
in product sales was principally due to management's decision to discontinue the
remaining product

reselling contracts in fiscal 2000. The final orders from these contracts were
fulfilled in fiscal 2001, and BTG anticipates minimal product sales as a
percentage of its total revenues in future periods.

    DIRECT COSTS

    Direct costs, expressed as a percentage of total revenue, decreased from
67.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2000 to 65.0% for the three months
ended June 30, 2001, primarily due to the higher percentage of contract-related
business. Contract costs include labor costs, subcontract costs, material costs
and other costs directly related to contract revenue. Contract costs as a
percentage of contract revenue decreased from 65.9% for the three months ended
June 30, 2000 to 64.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2001. Cost of product
sales as a percentage of product sales increased slightly from 97.4% in the
three months ended June 30, 2000 to 100.0% in the three months ended June 30,
2001.

    INDIRECT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

    Indirect, general and administrative expenses include the costs of indirect
labor, fringe benefits, overhead, sales and administration, bid and proposal
preparation, and research and development. Indirect, general and administrative
expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2001 increased by $4.0 million, or
26.2%, from the same period in 2000, principally due to the contract revenue
activities associated with the acquisition of RPI.

    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE

    Depreciation expense increased $211,000, principally due to the acquisition
of the fixed assets of RPI. Due to the implementation of Financial Accounting
Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, GOODWILL
AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, on April 1, 2001, BTG had no amortization expense
associated with its goodwill in the three months ended June 30, 2001. This
compares to $255,000 that was recorded in the comparable period of the prior
year.

    INTEREST EXPENSE

    Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2001 decreased by
$196,000, or 23.8%, from June 30, 2000. This decrease was principally due to the
lower amount of outstanding debt compared to the prior year and the reduction of
interest rates in the general economy.

    PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

    Income tax expense, as a percentage of income before income taxes, decreased
to 39.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2001, from 42.5% in the comparable
period of the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in the three months ended
June 30, 2001 is largely attributable to there being no non-deductible
amortization component of pre-tax income.

    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    OPERATING ACTIVITIES

    Operating activities during the three months ended June 30, 2001 used net
cash of approximately $2.6 million. This largely resulted from net income of
$1.3 million offset by a $3.4 million decrease in accounts payable.

    INVESTING ACTIVITIES

    BTG's investing activities used $10.4 million of cash during the three
months ended June 30, 2001. This was primarily due to $9.2 million associated
with the RPI business combination and a $1.0 million

additional investment made in DOAR Communications, Inc., which is a privately
held leading provider of advanced technology-based systems and services for the
judicial court, litigation, and alternative dispute resolution markets.

    FINANCING ACTIVITIES

    During the three months ended June 30, 2001, BTG's financing activities
provided cash of approximately $13.0 million. This resulted primarily from
$7.9 million of net advances under its Credit Facility and the issuance of $5.1
million of debt used to finance the RPI business combination.

    As of June 30, 2001, working capital was $35.3 million, compared to
$31.8 million at March 31, 2001. At June 30, 2001, BTG had approximately
$10.3 million available for borrowing under the Credit Facility. BTG expects
that funds provided by its operating activities and available under the Credit
Facility will be sufficient to fund its cash requirements for the next twelve
months.

    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No. 133 establishes methods of
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related
to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. Because BTG currently
holds no derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities, it
does not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 to have a material impact on
its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. BTG will be
required to implement SFAS No. 133 for the year ending March 31, 2002.

    In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
("SAB 101"). SAB 101 summarizes certain areas of the Staff's views in applying
generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
statements. BTG believes that its current revenue recognition practices comply
with SAB 101.

    In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING STOCK
COMPENSATION, AN INTERPRETATION OF APB OPINION NO. 25. This interpretation is
generally effective for applicable transactions beginning July 1, 2000. The
adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on BTG's
consolidated financial statements.

    In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, and
No. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. SFAS No. 141 improves the
transparency of the accounting and reporting for business combinations by
requiring that all business combinations be accounted for under a single method,
the purchase method. Use of the pooling-of-interests method will no longer be
permitted for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be
reviewed periodically for impairment. BTG adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 142 on April 1, 2001 and, consequently, no amortization expense was recorded
in the quarterly period ended June 30, 2001. Had SFAS No. 142 been adopted on
April 1, 2000, net income and diluted earnings per share would have been
$1.67 million and $0.18, respectively, for the quarterly period ended June 30,
2000 and $3.8 million and $0.42, respectively, for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2001.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

    BTG does not believe that there are any disclosures required under this item
with respect to market risk-sensitive instruments. BTG's obligations under the
Credit Facility bear interest at rates indexed to current market rates.

             UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA

    Titan's proposed acquisition of BTG will be accounted for as a purchase.
Titan has presented below unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data
that reflects the proposed acquisition of BTG and is intended to give you a
better picture of what the businesses of Titan combined with the recent
acquisition of Datron and the proposed acquisition of BTG might have looked like
if the merger between the companies had occurred on January 1, 2000, the first
day of the first period for which financial information is presented. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations combine the
Titan consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended December 31,
2000 and for the six months ended June 30, 2001 with the Datron consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2001 and for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 with the BTG consolidated statements of operations
for the year ended March 31, 2001 and for the six months ended June 30, 2001,
respectively, to reflect the proposed acquisition of BTG by Titan. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are not necessarily
indicative of the results that would have occurred had the proposed acquisition
of BTG and the recent acquisition of Datron been consummated at the beginning of
the periods presented or the results that may be attained in the future.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared
as of June 30, 2001, giving effect to the proposed acquisition of BTG by Titan
including the recent acquisition of Datron as though both had been consummated
on that date.

                             THE TITAN CORPORATION
      NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                    (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE INFORMATION)

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    The Titan Corporation (Titan) completed its acquisition of all of the stock
of Datron Systems Incorporated (Datron) on September 28, 2001. On September 19,
2001, Titan entered into an agreement to acquire BTG, Inc. (BTG). The
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations
combine the consolidated statements of operations of Titan for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and for the six months ended June 30, 2001 with the
consolidated statements of operations of Datron for the year ended March 31,
2001 and for the six months ended June 30, 2001, with the consolidated
statements of operations of BTG for the year ended March 31, 2001 and for the
six months ended June 30, 2001, respectively, to reflect the proposed
acquisition of BTG by Titan.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations assume
the proposed acquisition of BTG and the recent acquisition of Datron were
consummated at the beginning of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statements of operations are not necessarily indicative of
results that would have occurred had the proposed acquisition of BTG and recent
acquisition of Datron been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented
or the results that may be attained in the future.

    The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared
as of June 30, 2001, giving effect to the acquisition of BTG by Titan including
the recent Datron acquisition as though both had been consummated on that date.

    Certain information normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles has been condensed or
omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Titan
and the historical consolidated financial statements of Datron and BTG.

NOTE 2.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS FOR DATRON ACQUISITION

    (a) Record allocation of excess of Titan's purchase price over the estimated
       fair value of the net assets acquired, to goodwill and other intangibles.
       Upon completion of the proposed transaction, an independent valuation
       will be performed to determine the purchase price allocation based upon
       the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.

    (b) Record estimated other accrued liabilities arising as a result of the
       transaction as follows:

Employment termination agreements for Datron employees......   $2,400
Direct transaction costs to consummate acquisition including
  investment banking, legal, printing and accounting fees...    1,600
                                                               ------
                                                               $4,000
                                                               ======

    (c) Issue 2,621,000 shares, assuming 2,749,000 Datron shares outstanding and
       451,000 Datron stock options outstanding, assuming a $16.01 price per
       share paid for Datron shares and a ten-day average Titan stock price of
       $19.54, equivalent to a .81919 exchange ratio of Titan shares paid for
       each Datron share outstanding. Eliminate Datron common stock, capital in
       excess of par value and retained earnings as of June 30, 2001.

    (d) Record deferred compensation of $383 for all unvested Datron stock
       options based on the difference between the fair value on the date of
       consummation of the acquisition and the exercise price of the unvested
       Datron stock options, after giving effect to the exchange ratio described
       in Note (c) above. Amortization of deferred compensation of $128 and $64
       has been reflected in the pro forma condensed combined statements of
       operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the three months
       ended June 30, 2001, respectively.

    (e) Reflect the net change to the combined shares outstanding after
       calculating the number of shares to be issued by Titan in the transaction
       less the Datron shares currently outstanding, using the price and
       exchange assumptions described in Note (c) above.

NOTE 3.  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS FOR PROPOSED BTG ACQUISITION

    (a) To reflect the 19% cash portion of total merger consideration for BTG,
       to the extent of cash available on hand, with the remaining balance
       reflected as an additional advance on the Company's line of credit.

    (b) Record allocation of excess of Titan's purchase price over the estimated
       fair value of the net assets acquired, to goodwill and other intangibles.
       Upon completion of the proposed transaction, an independent valuation
       will be performed to determine the purchase price allocation based upon
       the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.

    (c) Record estimated other accrued liabilities arising as a result of the
       transaction as follows:

Employment termination agreements for BTG employees.........  $ 4,500
Direct transaction costs to consummate acquisition including
  investment banking, advisory, legal, printing and
  accounting fees...........................................    7,500
                                                              -------
                                                              $12,000
                                                              =======

    (d) Issue 6,634,000 shares, assuming 8,932,000 BTG shares outstanding and
       1,958,000 BTG stock options and other stock purchase rights outstanding,
       assuming a $13.35 price per share paid for BTG shares and an average
       Titan stock price of $17.74, equivalent to a .75211 exchange ratio of
       Titan shares paid for each BTG share outstanding multiplied by 81%, the
       ratio of merger consideration to be paid in Titan common stock, equalling
       a .60921 exchange ratio of Titan common stock to be paid for each BTG
       share outstanding. Eliminate BTG common stock and retained earnings as of
       June 30, 2001.

    (e) To reflect incremental interest expense on advances under Titan's line
       of credit to fund the 19% cash portion of the purchase price of BTG.

    (f) Reflect the net change to the combined shares outstanding after
       calculating the number of shares to be issued by Titan in the transaction
       less the BTG shares currently outstanding, using the price and exchange
       assumptions described in Note (d) above.

                       DESCRIPTION OF TITAN CAPITAL STOCK

    The following description of Titan's capital stock does not constitute a
complete description of all the terms of Titan's capital stock and should be

have been filed by Titan with the SEC and are incorporated herein by reference.

    Titan's authorized capital stock as of June 30, 2001 consisted of:

    - 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of which
      53,747,792 shares were issued and outstanding; and

    - 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, of which
      1,068,102 shares have been designated as $1.00 cumulative convertible
      preferred stock, of which 689,978 shares were issued and outstanding, and
      1,000,000 shares have been designated as series A junior participating
      preferred stock, none of which is issued and outstanding.

    Titan has reserved for issuance under its 1990, 1994 and 1997 Stock Option

    The following summary describes the material terms of Titan's capital stock
and stockholder rights plan. The description of capital stock and stockholder
rights plan is qualified by reference to Titan's certificate of incorporation,
bylaws and stockholder rights plan.

COMMON STOCK

    DIVIDENDS.  Subject to the right of the holders of any class of preferred
stock, holders of shares of Titan common stock are entitled to receive dividends
that may be declared by Titan's board of directors out of legally available
funds. No dividend may be declared or paid in cash or property on any share of
any class of common stock unless simultaneously the same dividend is declared or
paid on each share of that and every other class of common stock; provided,
that, in the event of stock dividends, holders of a specific class of common
stock shall be entitled to receive only additional shares of that class.

    VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of Titan common stock are entitled to one vote
for each share held and do not have cumulative voting rights.

    LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.  Upon Titan's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up,
the holders of Titan common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets
available for distribution after payment in full to creditors and holders of
Titan preferred stock, if any.

    OTHER PROVISIONS.  The holders of Titan common stock are not entitled to
preemptive or similar rights.

PREFERRED STOCK

    Titan is currently authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of which 1,068,102 shares have been previously
designated as $1.00 cumulative convertible preferred stock, of which 689,978
shares were issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2001, and 1,000,000 shares
have been designated as series A junior participating preferred stock, none of
which is issued and

outstanding. Titan's board of directors, in its sole discretion, may designate
and issue one or more series of preferred stock from Titan's authorized and
unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by law or
Titan's certificate of incorporation, the board of directors is empowered to
determine:

    - the designation of and the number of shares constituting a series of
      preferred stock;

    - the dividend rate, if any, for the series;

    - the terms and conditions of any voting and conversion rights for the
      series, if any;

    - the number of directors, if any, which the series shall be entitled to
      elect;

    - the amounts payable on the series upon Titan's liquidation, dissolution or
      winding-up;

    - the redemption prices and terms applicable to the series, if any; and

    - the preferences and relative rights among the series of preferred stock.

These rights, preferences, privileges and limitations of preferred stock could
adversely affect the rights of holders of Titan common stock.

CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

    DIVIDENDS.  Each share of cumulative convertible preferred stock accrues
dividends at the rate of $1.00 per share per annum.

    VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of Titan's cumulative convertible preferred
stock are entitled to one-third of one vote for each share held and do not have
cumulative voting rights.

    LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.  Upon Titan's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up,
the holders of Titan's cumulative convertible preferred stock are entitled to a
liquidation preference of $20 per share plus any unpaid cumulative dividends
before any distribution to holders of Titan common stock.

    CONVERSION RIGHTS.  Each outstanding share of cumulative convertible
preferred stock is convertible into Titan common stock, at the option of the
holder, at a rate of two-thirds shares of common stock for each share of
cumulative convertible preferred stock.

    REDEMPTION.  Each share of cumulative convertible preferred stock is
redeemable, but only at Titan's option, at a redemption price of $20 per share
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.

    OTHER PROVISIONS.  The holders of Titan's cumulative convertible preferred
stock are not entitled to preemptive or similar rights.

CONVERTIBLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

    In February 2000, Titan Capital Trust, Titan's wholly owned subsidiary,
issued 5,000,000 convertible preferred securities (Remarketable Term Income
Deferrable Equity Securities, or HIGH TIDES(sm)) at $50 per security. The
provisions of the HIGH TIDES issued by the trust are as follows:

    DISTRIBUTIONS.  The HIGH TIDES accrue distributions of 5 3/4% per annum,
payable quarterly in arrears. Titan may defer payment of the distributions for
up to 20 consecutive quarters so long as no event of default with respect to the
HIGH TIDES has occurred and is continuing. The trust's ability to pay
distributions on the HIGH TIDES is solely dependent on its receipt of interest
payments from Titan under debentures Titan issued to the trust in consideration
of its distribution to Titan of the proceeds of its issuance of the HIGH TIDES.
The 5 3/4% per annum rate may change on the reset date described below.

    REMARKETING.  Approximately 5 years after issuance of the HIGH TIDES, a
remarketing agent will attempt to establish an annual distribution rate,
conversion price and redemption features for the HIGH TIDES that are consistent
with a price per HIGH TIDES equal to 101% of its liquidation preference and that
are also most favorable to Titan. The remarketing of the HIGH TIDES will become
effective on the reset date, which is any date (1) not later than February 15,
2005, or, if the day is not a business day, the next succeeding day, and
(2) not earlier than 70 business days prior to February 15, 2005, as may be
determined by the remarketing agent in its sole discretion. On or after the
reset date, the applicable per annum distribution rate will be the term rate
established by the remarketing agent based on the outcome of the remarketing.

    CONVERSION RIGHTS.  Each HIGH TIDES is convertible into 1.0076 shares of
Titan common stock. On or after the reset date, the conversion rights of the
HIGH TIDES shall be those established in the remarketing.

    REDEMPTION RIGHTS.  The HIGH TIDES are redeemable by Titan at its option in
whole or in part beginning on February 20, 2003 at $50.72 per HIGH TIDE, which
redemption price declines to $50.00 per HIGH TIDE beginning February 20, 2004
and continues in effect until the remarketing is effected, after which date the
redemption features for the HIGH TIDES are those established in the remarketing.

    VOTING RIGHTS.  Holders of HIGH TIDES are not entitled to voting rights,
unless Titan defaults under the debentures Titan issued to the trust or Titan's
guarantee of the trust's obligations to distribute available funds held by the
trust to satisfy obligations under the HIGH TIDES, in which case the holders of
HIGH TIDES are entitled, by majority vote, to appoint an additional trustee of
the trust or remove other trustees.

    LIQUIDATION RIGHTS.  If the trust is liquidated and the debentures Titan
issued to the trust are not distributed to the holders of HIGH TIDES, the
holders are entitled to receive, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors
of the trust as required by applicable law, $50 per HIGH TIDE plus accrued and
unpaid distributions.

PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS

    Each outstanding share of Titan common stock has or will have attached to it
one preferred share purchase right, which Titan refers to as a right. Each right
entitles the registered holder of Titan common stock to purchase from Titan,
upon the occurrence of specified events, one one-hundredth of a share of Titan's
series A junior participating preferred stock, which Titan refers to as the
participating preferred shares, at a price of $42 per one one-hundredth of a
participating preferred share, subject to adjustment. The terms of the rights
are set forth in a rights agreement dated as of August 21, 1995, between Titan
and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent.

    Until the distribution date described below, Titan will not issue separate
certificates evidencing the rights. Until that date, the rights will be
evidenced, with respect to any common stock certificate, by that common stock
certificate. The rights will detach from the common stock and a distribution
date will occur upon the earlier of the following dates:

    - subject to the exceptions described below, the tenth day following a
      public announcement that an "acquiring person," which, subject to the
      exceptions listed in the following sentence, includes a person or "group"
      of affiliated or associated persons, has acquired, or obtained the right
      to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Titan's outstanding
      common stock, or

    - the tenth day following the commencement, or the first public announcement
      by any person or group of an intention to commence, a tender offer or
      exchange offer that would result in beneficial ownership by a person or
      group of 15% or more of Titan's outstanding common stock.

    Titan's board of directors, with the concurrence of a majority of the
continuing directors, may postpone the distribution date by determining a later
distribution date before the time any person or group becomes an acquiring
person. Any board member who is not an acquiring person or an affiliate or
associate of an acquiring person, or an employee, director, representative,
nominee or designee of an acquiring person, or its affiliate or associate, but
who:

    - was a member of Titan's board of directors before any person becomes an
      acquiring person, or

    - became a member of Titan's board of directors after any person becomes an
      acquiring person if the member was nominated for election or elected to
      Titan's board of directors upon the recommendation or approval of a
      majority of the continuing directors, is considered to be a continuing
      director of Titan.

    The term "acquiring person" does not include Titan, any of its subsidiaries,
any of Titan's or its subsidiaries' employee benefit plans or any entity holding
Titan common stock for or under any of Titan's or its subsidiaries' employee
benefit plans. In addition, a person who would otherwise be an acquiring person
will not be considered an acquiring person if Titan's board of directors
determines in good faith that such person inadvertently became the beneficial
owner of 15% or more of Titan common stock and such person divests itself, as
promptly as practicable, of beneficial ownership of a sufficient number of
shares of Titan common stock so that it would no longer otherwise qualify as an
acquiring person.

    The rights agreement provides that, until the distribution date, or earlier
redemption or expiration of the rights, the rights will be transferred only with
Titan common stock. The rights will be evidenced, with respect to any common
stock certificate outstanding as of September 7, 1995, by that common stock
certificate with a summary of the rights attached to it. Until the distribution
date, or earlier redemption or expiration of the rights, new common stock
certificates issued after September 7, 1995, upon transfer or new issuances of
common stock will contain a notation incorporating the rights agreement by
reference. Until the distribution date, the surrender for transfer of any
certificates for common stock, even without a summary of the rights attached to
it, also will constitute the transfer of the rights associated with the common
stock represented by that certificate. As soon as practicable after the
distribution date, separate certificates evidencing the rights will be mailed to
holders of record of Titan common stock as of the close of business on the
distribution date, and the separate right certificates alone will evidence the
rights. Only Titan common stock issued before the distribution date will be
issued with rights.

    The rights are not exercisable until the distribution date. The rights will
expire on August 17, 2005, unless the expiration date is extended or unless the
rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by Titan, in each case as described
below.

    The purchase price payable for the participating preferred shares, and the
number of participating preferred shares or other securities or property
issuable, upon exercise of the rights, as well as the number of rights
outstanding, are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution in
the following circumstances:

    - in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or
      reclassification of the participating preferred shares,

    - upon the grant to holders of the participating preferred shares of rights
      or warrants to subscribe for or purchase participating preferred shares at
      a price, or securities convertible into participating preferred shares
      with a conversion price, less than the current market price of the
      participating preferred shares, or

    - upon the distribution to holders of the participating preferred shares of
      evidences of indebtedness, securities or assets, excluding regular
      periodic cash dividends at a rate not in

      excess of 125% of the last cash dividend paid or, in the case that regular
      cash dividends have not been paid, at a rate not in excess of 50% of the
      average net income per share of the four quarters ended immediately before
      the payment of the dividend, or dividends payable in participating
      preferred shares or of subscription rights or warrants, other than those
      referred to above.

    The number of outstanding rights and the number of one one-hundredths of a
participating preferred share issuable upon exercise of each right are also
subject to adjustment in the event of a dividend or other distribution on the
common stock payable in common stock or subdivisions, consolidations or
combinations of Titan common stock occurring, in any of those cases, before the
distribution date.

    Participating preferred shares purchasable upon exercise of the rights will
not be redeemable. Each participating preferred share will be entitled to a
minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1.00 per share, but will be
entitled to an aggregate dividend of 100 times the dividend declared per share
of Titan common stock. If there is a liquidation, the holders of the
participating preferred shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential
liquidation payment of $100 per share, but will be entitled to an aggregate
payment of 100 times the payment made per share of Titan common stock. Each
participating preferred share will have 100 votes, voting together with Titan
common stock. If there is a merger, consolidation or other transaction in which
Titan common stock is exchanged, each participating preferred share will be
entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per share of Titan common
stock. These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions.

    Because of the nature of the dividend, liquidation and voting rights of the
participating preferred shares, the value of the one one-hundredth interest in a
participating preferred share purchasable upon exercise of each right should
approximate the value of one share of Titan common stock.

    If any person or group becomes an acquiring person, except pursuant to
specified cash offers for all outstanding shares of Titan common stock approved
by Titan's board of directors, or if Titan is the surviving corporation in a
merger with an acquiring person or any affiliate or associate of an acquiring
person and Titan common stock is not changed or exchanged, proper provision will
be made so that each holder of a right, other than rights beneficially owned by
the acquiring person, which will become null and void, will have the right to
receive upon exercise of the right at the then-current market price, instead of
participating preferred shares, that number of shares of Titan common stock
having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right. If Titan
does not have sufficient common stock issued but not outstanding, or authorized
but unissued, to permit the exercise in full of the rights, Titan will be
required to take all action necessary to authorize additional common stock for
issuance upon exercise of the rights. If, after a good-faith effort, Titan is
unable to take all necessary action, Titan will substitute, for each share of
common stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exercise of a right, a number
of participating preferred shares, or fractional participating preferred shares,
with the same market value as that share of common stock.

    If, after a person or group has become an acquiring person, Titan is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of
Titan's consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be
made so that each holder of a right, other than rights beneficially owned by the
acquiring person, which will become null and void, will have the right to
receive, upon the exercise of the right at its then-current exercise price and
instead of participating preferred shares, that number of shares of common stock
of the acquiring company, or its parent, which at the time of the transaction
will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the right.

    The exercise price of a right at any date will be equal to the purchase
price at that date multiplied by the number of one one-hundredths of a
participating preferred share for which a right is exercisable at that date.

    At any time after any person or group becomes an acquiring person and before
the acquisition by that person or group of 50% or more of Titan's outstanding
common stock, Titan's board of directors may exchange the rights, in whole or in
part, for a number of shares of Titan common stock, per right, having an
aggregate value equal to the excess of the value of the shares of Titan common
stock issuable upon exercise of a right after a person or group becomes an
acquiring person over the purchase price, subject to adjustment. Titan's board
of directors will not exchange the rights owned by the acquiring person or
group, which will have become null and void.

    With specified exceptions, no adjustments in the purchase price for the
preferred shares will be required until cumulative adjustments require an
adjustment of at least 1% of that purchase price. No fractional participating
preferred shares will be issued, other than fractions which are integral
multiples of one one-hundredth of a participating preferred share, which may, at
Titan's election, be evidenced by depositary receipts. Instead of issuing
fractional participating preferred shares, Titan will make an adjustment in cash
based on the market price of the participating preferred shares on the last
trading day before the date of exercise.

    Upon approval by Titan's board of directors, Titan may redeem the rights, in
whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right at any time until 10 days
following the public announcement that a person or group has become an acquiring
person. Titan's board of directors, with the concurrence of a majority of the
continuing directors, may extend the period during which the rights are
redeemable beyond the 10 days following the public announcement that a person or
group has become an acquiring person.

    Under circumstances described in the rights agreement, the decision to
redeem will require the concurrence of a majority of the continuing directors.
Immediately upon the determination of Titan's board of directors to redeem the
rights, Titan will make an announcement of the redemption. Upon the redemption,
the right to exercise the rights will terminate and the only right of right
holders will be to receive the redemption price.

    Until a right is exercised, the holder of the right, in the capacity of a
holder, will have no rights as a stockholder of Titan, including, without
limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. Although the distribution
of the rights will not be taxable to stockholders or to Titan, stockholders may,
depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the
rights become exercisable for Titan common stock or other consideration, or for
common stock of the acquiring company or its parent as set forth above.

    Any of the provisions of the rights agreement may be amended or supplemented
by Titan's board of directors before the distribution date. From and after the
distribution date, Titan and the rights agent may amend or supplement the rights
agreement from time to time without the approval of any holders of rights:

    - to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any defective or
      inconsistent provisions,

    - to shorten or lengthen any time period under the rights agreement relating
      to when the rights may be redeemed, so long as, under specified
      circumstances, a majority of the continuing directors approve the
      shortening or lengthening, or

    - to make any other provisions with respect to the rights which Titan and
      the rights agent may deem necessary or desirable.

    Notwithstanding this right to amend or supplement, from and after the
distribution date, the rights agreement may not be amended in any manner which
would adversely affect the interest of the holders of rights.

SECTION 203 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

    Titan is subject to section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
which, with specified exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging
in any "business combination" with any "interested stockholder" for a period of
three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested
stockholder unless:

    - before that time, the board of directors of the corporation approved
      either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
      stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

    - upon completion of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
      becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
      least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
      the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
      number of shares outstanding those shares owned by persons who are
      directors and also officers and by employee stock plans in which employee
      participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether
      shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange
      offer; or

    - at or after that time, the business combination is approved by the board
      of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
      stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at
      least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the
      interested stockholder.

    Section 203 defines "business combination" to include the following:

    - any merger or consolidation of the corporation with the interested
      stockholder;

    - any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition
      of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested
      stockholder;

    - subject to specified exceptions, any transaction that results in the
      issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to
      the interested stockholder;

    - any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of
      increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of
      the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or

    - any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans,
      advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
      through the corporation.

    In general, section 203 defines an "interested stockholder" as any entity or
person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation or any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled
by that entity or person.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS; SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS

    Titan is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
which, with specified exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging
in any "business combination" with any "interested stockholder" for a period of
three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested
stockholder unless:

    - before that time, the board of directors of the corporation approved
      either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
      stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

    - upon completion of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
      becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at
      least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time
      the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
      number of shares outstanding those shares owned by persons who are
      directors and also officers and by employee stock plans in which employee
      participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether
      shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange
      offer; or

    - at or after that time, the business combination is approved by the board
      of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
      stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at
      least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the
      interested stockholder.

    Section 203 defines "business combination" to include the following:

    - any merger or consolidation of the corporation with the interested
      stockholder;

    - any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition
      of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested
      stockholder;

    - subject to specified exceptions, any transaction that results in the
      issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to
      the interested stockholder;

    - any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of
      increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of
      the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or

    - any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans,
      advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or
      through the corporation.

    In general, Section 203 defines an "interested stockholder" as any entity or
person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation or any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled
by that entity or person.

    BTG is subject to Article 14 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act which,
with specified exceptions, prohibits a Virginia corporation from engaging in any
"affiliated transaction" with any "interested shareholder" for a period of three
years following the time that the shareholder became an interested stockholder
unless the affiliated transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested
directors and by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
voting stock which is not owned by any interested shareholder.

    Article 14 defines "affiliated transaction" to include the following:

    - any merger or consolidation of the corporation with the interested
      shareholder or any other corporation that immediately after the merger
      would be an affiliate of an interested shareholder that was an interested
      shareholder immediately before the merger;

    - any statutory share exchange in which the interested shareholder acquires
      one or more classes or series of voting securities of the corporation or
      its subsidiaries;

    - any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition
      of any assets of the corporation to or with an interested shareholder
      representing 5% or more of the consolidated net worth of the corporation
      as of the date of the most recently available financial statements, or any
      guarantee of indebtedness of an interested shareholder in an amount in
      excess of 5% or more of the consolidated net worth of the corporation as
      of the date of the most recently available financial statements;

    - with specified exceptions, any sale or disposition by the corporation or
      any of its subsidiaries to the interested shareholder of any voting shares
      of the corporation or its subsidiaries having an aggregate fair market
      value in excess of 5% of the aggregate fair market value of all
      outstanding voting shares of the corporation on the date the interested
      shareholder became an interested shareholder;

    - the dissolution of the corporation if proposed by or on behalf of an
      interested shareholder; or

    - any reclassification of securities, including any reverse stock split,
      recapitalization, merger of the corporation with any of its subsidiaries
      or any distribution or other transaction, whether or not with or into or
      otherwise involving the interested shareholder, which has the effect,
      directly or indirectly, of increasing by more than 5% the percentage of
      voting shares beneficially owned by an interested shareholder.

    In general, Article 14 defines an "interested shareholder" as any entity or
person beneficially owning 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
corporation or any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled
by that entity or person.

    The prohibitions set forth in Article 14 of the Virginia Stock Corporation
Act do not apply to affiliated transactions that have been approved in advance
by a majority of the corporation's disinterested directors. BTG's board of
directors has taken all action necessary to ensure that the prohibitions set
forth in Article 14 will not apply in connection with the proposed merger with
Titan.

    TITAN.  Titan's certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not have
supermajority or other special voting requirements for business combinations or
other transactions.

    BTG.  Under Virginia law, approval of a merger or share exchange requires
the affirmative vote of holders of more than two-thirds of the votes entitled to
be cast on the matter by each voting group.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

    TITAN.  Titan's certificate of incorporation does not provide for appraisal
rights other than those rights designated by the Delaware General Corporation
Law. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides for appraisal rights only in
the case of specified mergers or consolidations and not, unless the certificate
of incorporation of a corporation so provides, in the case of other mergers, a
sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or an amendment to
its certificate of incorporation. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation
Law does not provide appraisal rights in connection with a merger or
consolidation, unless the certificate of incorporation of a corporation so
provides, to the holders of shares of a constituent corporation listed on a
national securities exchange, or designated as a national market system security
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or held of record by
more than 2,000 stockholders, unless the applicable agreement of merger or
consolidation requires the holders of those shares to receive, in exchange for
those shares, any property other than shares of stock of the resulting or
surviving corporation, shares of stock of any other corporation listed on a
national securities exchange or designated as described above, or held of record
by more than 2,000 holders, cash in lieu of fractional shares or any combination
of the foregoing. The Delaware General Corporation Law also denies appraisal
rights to the stockholders of the surviving corporation in a merger if such
merger did not require approval by the stockholders of the surviving
corporation.

    BTG.  BTG's articles of incorporation do not provide for appraisal rights
other than those rights designated by the Virginia Stock Corporation Act. The
Virginia Stock Corporation Act generally provides for appraisal rights in the
case of specified mergers or consolidations and the sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of its assets. However, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act
does not provide appraisal rights in connection with a merger or share exchange,
unless the articles of incorporation of a corporation so provides, to the
holders of shares of a constituent corporation listed on a national securities
exchange or on Nasdaq, or held of record by more than 2,000 shareholders, unless
the applicable plan of merger or share exchange requires the holders of those
shares to receive, in exchange for those shares, any property other than cash,
shares of stock of the resulting or surviving corporation, shares of stock of
any other corporation listed on a national securities exchange or held of record
by more than 2,000 holders, cash in lieu of fractional shares or any combination
of the foregoing or the transaction to be voted on is an affiliated transaction
and is not approved by a majority of disinterested directors. The Virginia Stock
Corporation Act also denies appraisal rights to the shareholders of the
surviving corporation in a merger if such merger did not require approval by the
shareholders of the surviving corporation.

SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws provide that special meetings may be called by Titan
pursuant to Titan's notice of meeting provisions. The stockholders of Titan do
not have the right to request or call a special meeting of stockholders, but a
stockholder may nominate persons for election as directors at a special meeting
called by Titan for the purpose of electing directors if the stockholder
complies with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws.

    BTG.  Under BTG's articles of incorporation, special meetings of
shareholders may be called at any time by:

    - the chairman of the BTG board;

    - the BTG president;

    - a majority of the BTG directors then in office, even if less than a
      quorum; or

    - the holders of more than 50% or, if BTG has not held an annual meeting
      within 15 months since the date of the last annual meeting, 20%, of the
      total number of votes of the then outstanding shares of stock of BTG
      entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting

      together as a single class, if the holders sign, date and deliver to the
      BTG secretary one or more written demands for the meeting, describing the
      purpose for which it is to be held.

STOCKHOLDER ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws provide that stockholder action may be taken by
written consent instead of a meeting, but only upon compliance with advance
notice and other procedural requirements specified in Titan's bylaws. Any Titan
stockholder of record seeking to have Titan's stockholders authorize or take
corporate action by written consent must, by written notice to Titan's
secretary, request Titan's board of directors to fix a record date for the
purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to consent to the action in
writing without a meeting. Within 10 days of receiving the notice, Titan's board
of directors must adopt a resolution fixing the record date, which must not
precede, or be more than 10 days after, the date of the resolution. If the Titan
board of directors does not fix a record date in this manner, the record date:

    - when no prior action by the Titan board of directors is required by
      applicable law, will be the first date on which a signed written consent
      describing the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to Titan;
      or

    - when prior action by the Titan board of directors is required by
      applicable law, will be at the close of business on the date on which the
      Titan board of directors adopts the resolution taking the required action.

    In addition, Titan's bylaws provide that no stockholder action by written
consent is effective until nationally recognized inspectors of election certify
to Titan that the consents properly delivered to Titan represent at least the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action.
All stockholder consents must be properly delivered to Titan within 60 days of
the date that the earliest dated written consent was received by Titan.

    BTG.  BTG's bylaws provide that shareholder action may be taken by written
consent without a meeting, but only if the consent is unanimous.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL PROCEDURES

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws require that notice of proposals by stockholders to
be brought before any annual meeting must be delivered to Titan not later than
the 60th day nor earlier than the 90th day before the first anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting. If, however, the annual meeting is more than
30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date, the notice must
be delivered not earlier than the 90th day nor later than the 60th day before
the annual meeting, or the 10th day following the date on which Titan first
publicly announces the annual meeting date. The notice must include, as to each
matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:

    - a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
      meeting and the reasons for conducting that business at the annual
      meeting;

    - the name, age and business and residential addresses, as they appear on
      Titan's records, of the stockholders proposing such business;

    - the class and number of Titan's capital stock which are beneficially owned
      by the stockholder; and

    - any material interest of the stockholder in the proposed business.

    BTG.  BTG's bylaws require that notice of proposals by shareholders to be
brought before any annual meeting must be delivered to BTG not later than
90 days before the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. In
addition to a brief description of the proposal desired to be acted

upon, the notice must include, as to each matter the shareholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting:

    - the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the proposal;

    - a representation that the shareholder is the holder of record of shares of
      BTG entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to appear in person or by
      proxy to present the proposal; and

    - a description of all arrangements, understandings or relationships between
      the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (and
      naming them) pursuant to which the shareholder is making the proposal.

STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

    TITAN.  Titan is a party to the Titan rights agreement with American Stock
Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent. The description of the Titan rights
agreement in this proxy statement/ prospectus is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Titan rights agreement, which is incorporated into this
document by reference to Titan's registration statement on Form 8-A12B, filed
with the SEC on August 24, 1995. To obtain a copy of the Titan rights agreement,
please follow the procedures specified under the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" on
page 106.

    The Titan rights agreement provides, among other things, that when specified
events occur holders of Titan common stock will be entitled to purchase from
Titan a number of shares of Titan common stock equal to two times the exercise
of the right, which is initially $42 but is subject to adjustment. Therefore,
for example, if the Titan common stock had a current market value of $21, a
Titan stockholder would be entitled to purchase four shares of Titan common
stock for $42. Under the Titan rights agreement, the rights are triggered by the
earlier to occur of (1) subject to the exceptions described below, the tenth day
following a public announcement that an "acquiring person," which, subject to
the exceptions listed in the following sentence, includes a person or "group" of
affiliated or associated persons, has acquired, or obtained the right to
acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Titan's outstanding common
stock, or (2) the tenth day following the commencement, or the first public
announcement by any person or group of an intention to commence, a tender offer
or exchange offer that would result in beneficial ownership by a person or group
of 15% or more of Titan's outstanding common stock. The rights would cause
substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire Titan on
terms not approved by its board of directors.

    BTG.  BTG is a party to the BTG rights agreement with First Union National
Bank, as rights agent, the function of which is substantially similar to that of
the Titan rights agreement. To obtain a copy of the BTG rights agreement, please
follow the procedures specified under the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION" on
page 106.

CLASSIFIED BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    TITAN.  Titan's certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not provide for a
classified board of directors. The size of Titan's board of directors is
currently fixed by the Titan bylaws at nine directors.

    BTG.  BTG's articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that the directors
shall be classified into three classes, with each class to contain as near as
possible to one-third of the total number of directors then in office. The
members of each class serve for three-year terms and until their successors are
elected and shall have qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal. The total number of directors on the BTG board may vary between seven
and 15 members as is fixed by the BTG board of directors. The size of the BTG
board is currently comprised of eight members, divided into two classes of three
directors and one class of two directors.

NOMINATIONS OF DIRECTORS

    TITAN.  Subject to the rights of holders of Titan's $1.00 cumulative
convertible preferred stock described below, Titan's bylaws provide that
nominations for the election of directors may be made by Titan's board of
directors or Titan's stockholders. Titan's bylaws provide that any stockholder
wishing to nominate persons for election as directors at an annual meeting must
deliver to the secretary of Titan, at Titan's principal office in San Diego, a
written notice of the stockholder's intention to make a director nomination. The
stockholder is required to furnish the notice not later than 60 days nor earlier
than 90 days before the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting. If, however, the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more
than 60 days after the anniversary date, the notice must be delivered not
earlier than the 90th day nor later than the 60th day before the annual meeting,
or the 10th day following the date on which Titan first publicly announces the
annual meeting date. The notice must set forth the following information:

    - the name and address of record of the stockholder who intends to make the
      nomination;

    - a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of Titan
      common stock and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
      nominate the person or persons specified in the notice;

    - the name, age, business and residential addresses and principal occupation
      or employment of each nominee;

    - a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
      stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons,
      naming such person or persons, pursuant to which the nomination or are to
      be made by the stockholder;

    - other information regarding each proposed nominee as would be required to
      be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the rules and
      regulations of the SEC; and

    - the written consent of each proposed nominee to serve as a director of
      Titan if so elected.

    Holders of Titan's $1.00 cumulative preferred stock are entitled to elect
two directors to Titan's board of directors in the event of a default in the
payment of dividends on the $1.00 cumulative convertible preferred stock. The
size of Titan's board in this event would be increased by two directors.

    BTG.  BTG's bylaws provide that nominations for the election of directors
may be made by BTG's board of directors or by any shareholder entitled to vote
in the election of directors. BTG's bylaws require that any shareholder wishing
to nominate persons for election as directors at an annual meeting must deliver
to the secretary of BTG a written notice of the shareholder's intention to make
a director nomination. The nomination notice must be delivered to BTG not later
than 90 days before the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting. The notice must include the following information:

    - the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the proposal;

    - a representation that the shareholder is the holder of record of shares of
      BTG entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to appear in person or by
      proxy to present the proposal;

    - a description of all arrangements, understandings or relationships between
      the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (and
      naming them) pursuant to which the shareholder is making the proposal; and

    - other information regarding each proposed nominee as would be required to
      be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the rules and
      regulations of the SEC; and

    - the written consent of each proposed nominee to serve as a director of BTG
      if so elected.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

    TITAN.  Under Titan's bylaws, Titan's directors may be removed at any time,
either with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of stockholders having a
majority of the voting power of Titan. This bylaw provision is subject to rights
under Titan's certificate of incorporation of holders of Titan's $1.00
cumulative convertible preferred stock during any period in which Titan defaults
on the payment of dividends on the $1.00 cumulative convertible preferred stock.

    BTG.  Except as may be provided pursuant to the provisions of the BTG
articles of incorporation relating to any class or series of preferred stock
with rights to elect directors by separate class or series vote, any director
may be removed from the BTG board at any time, but only for "cause" and only
upon the affirmative vote of holders of more than 66 2/3% of the BTG
shareholders at a meeting called for the purpose of such removal. "Cause" is
defined in the BTG articles of incorporation to mean either:

    - conduct as a director of BTG or any subsidiary involving dishonesty of a
      material nature; or

    - criminal conduct, other than minor infractions and traffic violation, that
      relates to the performance of the director's duties as a director of BTG
      or any subsidiary.

VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws provide that, when any vacancy occurs in the Titan
board of directors, whether by reason of an increase in the number of members
composing the Titan board of directors, or otherwise, a majority of the
remaining members of the Titan board of directors, even though less than a
quorum may appoint a director or directors to fill such vacancy or vacancies.
The bylaws further provide, however, that if a vacancy is caused by removal,
then the successor must be elected by Titan stockholders at a special meeting
called for that purpose. This bylaw provision is subject to rights under Titan's
certificate of incorporation of holders of Titan's $1.00 cumulative convertible
preferred stock during any period in which Titan defaults on the payment of
dividends on the $1.00 cumulative convertible preferred stock.

    BTG.  BTG's articles of incorporation provide that, when any vacancy occurs
in the BTG board of directors, whether by reason of resignation, removal, death
or an increase in the number of members composing the BTG board of directors, or
otherwise, only a majority of the remaining members of the BTG board of
directors, even though less than a quorum, may appoint a director or directors
to fill such vacancy or vacancies. The term of any director so appointed will
expire at the end of the next shareholders meeting at which BTG directors are
elected or upon the appointee's earlier death, resignation or removal.

INDEMNIFICATION

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws provide for indemnification by Titan, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, of its officers, directors, employees and agents.

    BTG.  BTG's articles of incorporation provide for indemnification by BTG, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, of its officers and directors, as well as:

    - every individual who, while a director or officer of BTG, is or was
      serving at BTG's request as a director, officer, partner, trustee,
      employee or agent of another entity;

    - an individual who formerly served as an officer or director of BTG or who,
      while an officer or director of BTG, occupied any of the above positions
      with another entity at the request of BTG; and

    - the estate, personal representative, heirs, executors and administrators
      of an officer or director of BTG.

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS

    TITAN.  Titan's certificate of incorporation provides for the elimination
and limitation of the personal liability of directors for monetary damages to
the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. In
addition, Titan's certificate of incorporation provides that if the Delaware
General Corporation Law is amended to authorize the further elimination or
limitation of the liability of a director, then the liability of the directors
will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as so amended. The effect of this provision is to
eliminate the rights of Titan and its stockholders, through stockholder
derivative suits on behalf of Titan, to recover monetary damages against a
director for breach of the fiduciary duty of care as a director, including
breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior, except in
certain situations. The provision does not limit or eliminate the rights of
Titan or any stockholder to seek non- monetary relief such as an injunction or
rescission upon breach of a director's duty of care. This provision is
consistent with section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which
is designed, among other things, to encourage qualified individuals to serve as
directors of Delaware corporations.

    BTG.  BTG's articles of incorporation provide that, to the fullest extent
permitted by Virginia law as in effect or as they may be amended and
supplemented, in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of BTG shareholders, the
damages assessed against any officer or director of BTG arising out of a single
transaction, occurrence or course of conduct shall not exceed the sum of one
dollar ($1.00). This provision does not limit the liability of an officer or
director if the officer or director engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing
violation of the criminal law or of any federal or state securities law
including, but not limited to, any claim of unlawful insider trading or stock
market manipulation.

AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

    TITAN.  Titan's certificate of incorporation may be amended under the
Delaware General Corporation Law by a majority vote of the total number of
shares outstanding and entitled to vote on the amendment. If any amendment of
Titan's certificate of incorporation would adversely affect the rights of any
holders of shares of a class or series of capital stock, or such holders are
entitled to vote on the amendment, the vote of the holders of a majority of all
outstanding shares of the class or series, voting as a class, is also necessary
to authorize the amendment.

    BTG.  With the exception of minor amendments that may be adopted by BTG's
board of directors without a shareholder vote, BTG's articles of incorporation
generally may be amended under the Virginia Stock Corporation Act by the
affirmative vote of holders of more than two-thirds of the total number of
shares outstanding and entitled to vote on the amendment. If any amendment of
BTG's articles of incorporation would affect the rights of any holders of shares
of a class or series of capital stock, or such holders are entitled to vote on
the amendment, the vote of the holders of more than two-thirds of all
outstanding shares of the class or series, voting as a class, is also necessary
to authorize the amendment.

AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

    TITAN.  Titan's bylaws may be amended or repealed either by the Titan board
of directors, acting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Titan
directors, or by Titan's stockholders.

    BTG.  BTG's bylaws may be amended or repealed either by the BTG board of
directors, acting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the BTG directors, or
by the holders of not less than 66 2/3% of the

total number of shares of BTG capital stock entitled to vote on the matter, at a
meeting of shareholders called for that purpose upon notice duly given.

                                 LEGAL MATTERS

    Hogan & Hartson L.L.P. will pass on the validity of the shares of Titan
common stock to be issued to BTG shareholders in the transaction. Certain tax

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BTG, Inc.:

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BTG, Inc.
and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, cash flows and
comprehensive income for the years then ended. Our audit also included the
financial statement schedule (Schedule II) for the years ended March 31, 2001
and 2000. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of BTG, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

financial statements, we have also audited the accompanying financial statement
Schedule II--Valuation and Qualifying Accounts. These consolidated financial
statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audit.
