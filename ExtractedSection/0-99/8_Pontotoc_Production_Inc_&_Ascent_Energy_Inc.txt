The following provides details on events leading up to the merger deal:
BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER    

     The following discussion presents background information concerning the offer and the merger. Information on the actions of Pontotoc's management, the meetings
and deliberations of the Pontotoc board of directors and the activities of Pontotoc's advisors has been furnished by Pontotoc. 

     In June 2000, at a meeting arranged by Cochise Capital Inc., Pontotoc's financial advisor, Jeffrey Clarke, in his individual capacity, met with James "Robby" Robson,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Pontotoc, to discuss a possible joint venture to pursue acquisition, drilling and development activities with respect to certain of Pontotoc's properties.

    In July and August 2000, after discussions regarding the possible joint venture were abandoned due to Pontotoc's lack of interest, Jeffrey Clarke, who was appointed as
President of Forman in June 2000, contacted Mr. Robson and Cochise Capital Inc. to discuss Pontotoc's interest in being acquired by Forman, or one of its affiliates, primarily for
cash.

     On August 21, 2000, representatives of Forman met in Ada, Oklahoma with representatives of Pontotoc, including Mr. Robson, to discuss the proposed acquisition of
Pontotoc. After Forman signed a confidentiality agreement on August 21, 2000, Pontotoc provided Forman with background information concerning Pontotoc's reserves and other financial matters and
agreed to provide Forman with more information concerning Pontotoc's operations.

     Throughout August and September 2000, Forman conducted a due diligence review of Pontotoc and its operations.

    In September 2000, Mr. Clarke and Daniel O. Conwill, IV, a representative of one of Forman's largest shareholders, met with Mr. Robson to discuss an initial bid
to acquire Pontotoc for cash. After discussions with Mr. Robson, it was agreed that, primarily due to Forman's prior bankruptcy and the desire to operate through a Delaware corporation, the
acquisition would be made by a newly formed entity affiliated with Forman. The entity that was ultimately formed for this purpose is Ascent Energy, whose board of directors includes individuals who
were negotiating on its behalf. Over the next few weeks, Mr. Robson negotiated with representatives of Ascent Energy, primarily Mr. Clarke, with respect to the acquisition price. As a
compromise on the cash purchase price, Ascent Energy agreed to issue convertible securities to Pontotoc's stockholders in addition to paying $9.00 in cash per share. The

parties continued to negotiate the terms of the convertible security, including the conversion rate and the dividend preference.

    In October 2000, following continued discussions between representatives of Ascent Energy and Pontotoc, primarily Mr. Clarke and Mr. Robson, the parties reached
an agreement as to the principal economic terms of the transaction, subject to finalizing Ascent Energy's due diligence, negotiation of a definitive agreement and the approval of each party's board of
directors. The parties agreed to an acquisition price of $9.00 in cash per share plus preferred stock convertible into 10% of Ascent Energy's common stock.
During December 2000, as the parties were negotiating the terms of the merger agreement, Pontotoc contacted C. K. Cooper and Company, the only investment banking firm then
providing analyst coverage for Pontotoc, about providing a fairness opinion to the Pontotoc board in connection with this transaction. Pontotoc formally engaged C. K. Cooper and Company for this
purpose on January 11, 2001.

    On January 18, 2001, the Pontotoc board of directors held a special meeting to consider the offer, the merger and the merger agreement. Prior to the meeting, C.K. Cooper and
Company delivered to Mr. Robson its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, based on matters set forth in its opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of Pontotoc
common stock in the offer and merger under the merger agreement was fair to such holders, as a group, from a financial point of

view. At the special meeting of Pontotoc's board of directors, Mr. Robson reviewed the background of the proposed offer and merger, the terms of the merger agreement and related documents, and
the potential benefits of the offer and merger to Pontotoc's stockholders. Mr. Robson then advised the Pontotoc board of the oral opinion delivered by C.K. Cooper and Company. Following
discussion, the Pontotoc board unanimously determined that the terms of the offer, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of Pontotoc and its stockholders, approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the offer and the merger, and unanimously recommended
that Pontotoc's stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares in the offer and, if required by applicable law, adopt the merger agreement.
On January 19, 2001, the board of directors of Ascent Energy approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The board of directors of
Pontotoc Acquisition approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

    Late
in the evening on January 19, 2001, Pontotoc Acquisition, Ascent Energy, and Pontotoc executed and delivered the merger agreement. 

    On
January 22, 2001, Pontotoc issued a press release announcing the execution and delivery of the merger agreement. 

THE OFFER    

The Offer  

    We are offering to exchange $9.00 in cash and one share of our Series B preferred stock having a liquidation preference equal to $2.50 for each
outstanding share of Pontotoc common stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, subject to the terms and conditions described in this prospectus and the related letter of transmittal. 

    You
will not receive any fractional shares of our Series B preferred stock in exchange for your shares of Pontotoc common stock. In lieu of fractional shares, registered
holders will receive a number of shares of our Series B preferred stock rounded up to the next whole number (after taking into account all shares of Pontotoc common stock delivered by the record
owner). 

    The expiration date shall refer to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June  , 2001, unless we extend the period of time for which the offer is open, in which
case the term expiration date means the latest time and date on which the offer, as so extended, expires.

    If you are the record owner of your shares and you tender your shares directly to the exchange agent, you will not incur any brokerage commissions. If you own your shares through a
broker or other nominee, and your broker tenders the shares on your behalf, your broker may charge you a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to determine whether any charges
will apply. Except as set forth in the instructions to the letter of transmittal, we will pay or arrange to have paid any transfer taxes on the Pontotoc common stock resulting from the offer.

    We are making this offer in order to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pontotoc common stock. We intend, as soon as possible after completion of the offer, to have Pontotoc
Acquisition, the purchaser in the offer, merge with Pontotoc so that Pontotoc will become our wholly owned subsidiary. In the merger, each then outstanding share of Pontotoc common stock, except for
treasury shares of Pontotoc and shares that we hold for our own account, would be converted into the same amount of cash and number of shares of our Series B preferred stock per Pontotoc share
as is paid in the offer.

    Our obligation to exchange cash and shares of our Series B preferred stock for Pontotoc is subject to several conditions referred to below under "Conditions of Our Offer,"
including the minimum tender condition and other conditions that are discussed below.

Timing of Our Offer


    Our offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June      , 2001, but we may extend the offer from time to time as
necessary until all the conditions to the offer have been satisfied or, where permissible, waived. We may not extend the offer beyond May 31, 2001, without the consent of Pontotoc.

Extension, Termination and Amendment  

    We expressly reserve the right, in our sole discretion (subject to the provisions of the merger agreement), at any time or from time to time, to extend the
period of time during which the offer remains open, and we can do so by giving oral or written notice of the extension to the exchange agent. If we decide to extend the offer, we will make an
announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to the provisions of the merger
agreement, we are not making any assurance that we will exercise our right to extend the offer. During an extension, all Pontotoc shares previously tendered and not properly withdrawn will remain
subject to the offer, subject to your right to withdraw your Pontotoc shares. You should read the discussion under the caption "Withdrawal Rights" for more details.
Subject to the SEC's applicable rules and regulations, we also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, but subject to the provisions of the merger agreement, at any time or from
time to time, to delay acceptance for exchange of or, regardless of whether we previously accepted Pontotoc shares for exchange, exchange of any Pontotoc shares in the offer or to terminate the offer
and not accept for exchange or exchange any Pontotoc shares not previously accepted for exchange or exchanged, upon the failure of any of the conditions of the offer to be satisfied. We also reserve
our right to waive any condition, other than the minimum tender condition and the conditions relating to the absence of an injunction and the effectiveness of the registration statement for the shares
of our Series B preferred stock to be issued in the offer, or otherwise amend the offer in any respect, by giving oral or written notice of the waiver or amendment to the exchange agent and by
making a public announcement.

    We
will follow any extension, termination, amendment or delay, as promptly as practicable, with a public announcement. In the case of an extension, any announcement will be issued no
later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date.
Subject to applicable law, including Rules 14d-4(d) and 14d-6(c) under the Exchange Act, which require that any material change in the information published, sent or
given to stockholders in connection with the offer be promptly sent to stockholders in a manner reasonably designed to inform stockholders of the change, and without limiting the manner in which we
may choose to make any public announcement, we assume no obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any public announcement other than by making a general release to the public.
We confirm to you that if we make a material change in the terms of the offer or the information concerning the offer, or if we waive a material condition of the offer, we will extend
the offer to the extent required under the Exchange Act. If, prior to the expiration date, we change the percentage of Pontotoc shares being sought or the consideration offered to you, that change
will apply to all holders whose Pontotoc shares are accepted for exchange. If at the time notice of that change is first published, sent or given to you, the offer is scheduled to expire at any time
earlier than the tenth business day from and including the date that the notice is first so published, sent or given, we will extend the offer until the expiration of that ten business day period. For
purposes of the offer, a "business day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m. through 12:00 midnight, New York City
time.

    We may, although we do not currently intend to, elect to provide a subsequent offering period of three to 20 business days after the acceptance of Pontotoc shares in the offer if the
requirements under Exchange Act Rule 14d- 11 have been met. If we elect to provide a subsequent offering period, we will notify you by issuing a press release and we will file that press
release with the SEC. You will not have the right to withdraw any Pontotoc shares that you tender in the subsequent offering period.

Exchange of Shares; Delivery of Cash and Our Series B Preferred Stock

    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, including, if the offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of the extension or
amendment, we will accept for exchange, and will exchange, Pontotoc shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as promptly as practicable after the expiration date and promptly after they are
tendered during any subsequent offering period. In addition, subject to applicable rules of the SEC, we expressly reserve the right to delay acceptance for exchange or the exchange of Pontotoc shares
in order to comply with any applicable law. In all cases, exchange of Pontotoc shares tendered and accepted for exchange will be made only after timely receipt by the exchange agent of certificates
for those Pontotoc shares (or a confirmation of a book-entry transfer of those Pontotoc shares in the exchange agent's account at The Depository Trust Company, which we refer to as the
"DTC"), a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or a manually signed facsimile of that document and any other required documents.

    For purposes of the offer, we will be deemed to have accepted for exchange Pontotoc shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn as, if and when we notify the exchange agent of
our acceptance of the tenders of those Pontotoc shares in the offer. The exchange agent will deliver cash and our

Series B preferred stock in exchange for Pontotoc shares as soon as practicable after receipt of our notice. The exchange agent will act as our agent for the purpose of receiving cash and our
Series B preferred stock and transmitting our Series B preferred stock and cash to you. You will not receive any interest on any cash that we pay you for your Pontotoc shares, even if
there is a delay in making the exchange.
If we do not accept any tendered Pontotoc shares for exchange under the terms and conditions of the offer for any reason, or if certificates are submitted for more Pontotoc shares
than are tendered, we will return certificates for the unexchanged Pontotoc shares to the tendering stockholder or, in the case of Pontotoc shares tendered by book-entry transfer of
unexchanged Pontotoc shares into the exchange agent's account at DTC in accordance with the procedures set forth below under the discussion entitled "Procedure for Tendering," those Pontotoc shares
will be credited to an account maintained within DTC, as soon as practicable following expiration or termination of the offer.

Fractional Shares of Our Series B Preferred Stock  

    We will not issue certificates representing fractional shares of our Series B preferred stock in the offer. In lieu of fractional shares, registered
holders will receive a number of shares of our Series B preferred stock in exchange for shares of Pontotoc common stock rounded up to the next whole number (after taking into account all shares
of Pontotoc common stock delivered by you).

Withdrawal Rights  

    Your tender of Pontotoc shares in the offer is irrevocable, except that, other than during a subsequent offering period, Pontotoc shares tendered in the offer
may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date. If we elect to provide a subsequent offering period under Exchange Act Rule 14d-11, you will not have the right to
withdraw Pontotoc shares that you tender in the subsequent offering period.
