The following provides details about the events leading up to the merger deal between Pontotoc Production Inc & Ascent Energy Inc:
BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER

        The following discussion presents
background information concerning the offer and the merger. Information on the
actions of Pontotoc's management, the meetings and deliberations of the Pontotoc
board of directors and the activities of Pontotoc's advisors has been furnished
by Pontotoc.

        Jeffrey Clarke,
president of Ascent Energy, and James "Robby" Robson, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Pontotoc, first met in June 2000 in connection with a
potential investment by Jeffrey Clarke, in his individual capacity, and other
private investors in a possible joint venture with Pontotoc for the development
of certain of its properties.

        In July and August
2000, after discussions regarding the possible joint venture were abandoned,
Jeffrey Clarke had several telephone conversations with Robby Robson and
Pontotoc's financial advisor, Cochise Capital Inc., to discuss Pontotoc's
interest in considering potential business combination alternatives.

        On August 21, 2000,
representatives of Ascent Energy met in Ada, Oklahoma with representatives of
Pontotoc, including James "Robby" Robson, to discuss business combination
options. After Ascent Energy signed a confidentiality agreement on August 21,
2000, Pontotoc provided Ascent Energy with background information concerning
Pontotoc's reserves and other financial matters and agreed to provide Ascent
Energy with more information concerning Pontotoc's operations.

        Throughout August
and September 2000, Ascent Energy conducted a due diligence review of Pontotoc
and its operations.

        In September 2000,
Mr. Clarke and Daniel O. Conwill, IV, a representative of Jefferies &
Company, Inc., one of Ascent Energy's financial advisors, discussed Ascent
Energy's initial bid to acquire Pontotoc with Mr. Robson.

        In October 2000, following
continued discussions between senior representatives of Ascent Energy and
Pontotoc, the representatives of the parties reached a tentative agreement as to
the principal economic terms of the transaction, subject to finalizing Ascent
Energy's due diligence, negotiation of a definitive agreement and the approval
of each party's board of directors.

        On January 18, 2001, the Pontotoc
board of directors held a special meeting to consider the offer, the merger and
the merger agreement. Prior to the meeting, C.K. Cooper and Company delivered to
Mr. Robson its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, based on
matters set forth in its opinion, the consideration to be received by the
holders of Pontotoc common stock in the offer and merger pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair to such holders, as a group, from a financial point of view.
At the special meeting of Pontotoc's board of directors, Mr. Robson reviewed the
background of the proposed offer and merger, the terms of the merger agreement
and related documents, and the potential benefits of the offer and merger to
Pontotoc's stockholders. Mr. Robson then advised the Pontotoc board of the oral
opinion delivered by C.K. Cooper and Company. Following discussion, the Pontotoc
board unanimously determined that the terms of the offer, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were advisable and fair
to and in the best interests of Pontotoc and its stockholders, approved the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the offer and the merger, and unanimously recommended that Pontotoc's
stockholders accept the offer and tender their shares pursuant to the offer and,
if required by applicable law, adopt the merger agreement.
On January 19, 2001,
the board of directors of Ascent Energy approved the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. The board of directors of Pontotoc
Acquisition approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby.

        Late in the evening on January 19,
2001, Pontotoc Acquisition, Ascent Energy, and Pontotoc executed and delivered
the merger agreement.

        On January 22, 2001, Pontotoc
issued a press release announcing the execution and delivery of the merger
agreement.

THE OFFER

The Offer

        We are offering to exchange $9.00
in cash and one share of our Series B preferred stock having a liquidation
preference equal to $2.50 for each outstanding share of Pontotoc common stock
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, subject to the terms and conditions
described in this prospectus and the related letter of transmittal.

        You will not receive any
fractional shares of our Series B preferred stock in exchange for your shares of
Pontotoc common stock. In lieu of fractional shares, registered holders will
receive a number of shares of our Series B preferred stock rounded up to the
next whole number (after taking into account all shares of Pontotoc common stock
delivered by the record owner).

        The expiration date shall refer to
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on _________, 2001, unless we extend the period
of time for which the offer is open, in which case the term expiration date
means the latest time and date on which the offer, as so extended, expires.

        If you are the record owner of
your shares and you tender your shares directly to the exchange agent, you will
not incur any brokerage commissions. If you own your shares through a broker or
other nominee, and your broker tenders the shares on your behalf, your broker
may charge you a fee for doing so. You should consult your broker or nominee to
determine whether any charges will apply. Except as set forth in the
instructions to the letter of transmittal, transfer taxes on the Pontotoc common
stock pursuant to the offer will be paid by us or on our behalf.

    We are making this offer in order to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Pontotoc common stock. We intend, as soon as possible
after completion of the offer, to have Pontotoc Acquisition, the purchaser in
the offer, merge with Pontotoc. The purpose of the merger is to acquire all
Pontotoc shares not tendered and exchanged pursuant to the offer. In the merger,
each then outstanding share of Pontotoc common stock, except for treasury shares
of Pontotoc and shares that we hold for our own account, would be converted into
the same amount of cash and number of shares of our Series B preferred stock per
Pontotoc share as is paid in the offer.

        Our obligation to exchange cash
and shares of our Series B preferred stock for Pontotoc shares pursuant to the
offer is subject to several conditions referred to below under "Conditions of
Our Offer," including the minimum tender condition and other conditions that are
discussed below.

Timing of Our Offer


        Our offer is scheduled to expire
at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on ____________, 2001, but we may extend the
offer from time to time as necessary until all the conditions to the offer have
been satisfied or, where permissible, waived. We may not extend the offer beyond
May 31, 2001, without the consent of Pontotoc.

Extension, Termination and Amendment

        We expressly reserve the right, in
our sole discretion (subject to the provisions of the merger agreement), at any
time or from time to time, to extend the period of time during which the offer
remains open, and we can do so by giving oral or written notice of the extension
to the exchange agent. If we decide to extend the offer, we will make an
announcement to that effect no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
next business day after the previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to the
provisions of the merger agreement, we are not making any assurance that we will
exercise our right to extend the offer. During an extension, all Pontotoc shares
previously tendered and not properly withdrawn will remain subject to the offer,
subject to your right to withdraw your Pontotoc shares. You should read the
discussion under the caption "Withdrawal Rights" for more details.
Subject to the SEC's applicable
rules and regulations, we also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, but
subject to the provisions of the merger agreement, at any time or from time to
time, to delay acceptance for exchange of or, regardless of whether we
previously accepted Pontotoc shares for exchange, exchange of any Pontotoc
shares pursuant to the offer or to terminate the offer and not accept for
exchange or exchange any Pontotoc shares not previously accepted for exchange or
exchanged, upon the failure of any of the conditions of the offer to be
satisfied. We also reserve our right to waive any condition, other than the
minimum tender condition and the conditions relating to the absence of an
injunction and the effectiveness of the registration statement for the shares of
our Series B preferred stock to be issued in the offer, or otherwise amend the
offer in any respect, by giving oral or written notice of the waiver or
amendment to the exchange agent and by making a public announcement.

        We intend to request effectiveness
of the registration statement filed with the SEC at least five business days
before the initial expiration date of the offer, which would mean on or before
___________, 2001. If the registration statement has not been declared effective
at the initial expiration of the offer, we intend to extend the offer and
publicly announce the extension no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on
_____________, 2001.
We will follow any extension,
termination, amendment or delay, as promptly as practicable, with a public
announcement. In the case of an extension, any announcement will be issued no
later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the
previously scheduled expiration date. Subject to applicable law, including Rules
14d4(d) and 14d6(c) under the Exchange Act, which require that any material
change in the information published, sent or given to stockholders in connection
with the offer be promptly sent to stockholders in a manner reasonably designed
to inform stockholders of the change, and without limiting the manner in which
we may choose to make any public announcement, we assume no obligation to
publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any public announcement other than
by making a general release to the public.

        We confirm to you that if we make
a material change in the terms of the offer or the information concerning the
offer, or if we waive a material condition of the offer, we will extend the
offer to the extent required under the Exchange Act. If, prior to the expiration
date, we change the percentage of Pontotoc shares being sought or the
consideration offered to you, that change will apply to all holders whose
Pontotoc shares are accepted for exchange pursuant to the offer. If at the time
notice of that change is first published, sent or given to you, the offer is
scheduled to expire at any time earlier than the tenth business day from and
including the date that the notice is first so published, sent or given, we will
extend the offer until the expiration of that ten business day period. For
purposes of the offer, a "business day" means any day other than a Saturday,
Sunday or federal holiday and consists of the time period from 12:01 a.m.
through 12:00 midnight, New York City time.
We may, although we do not
currently intend to, elect to provide a subsequent offering period of three to
20 business days after the acceptance of Pontotoc shares in the offer if the
requirements under Exchange Act Rule 14d 11 have been met. If we elect to
provide a subsequent offering period, we will notify you by issuing a press
release at least five business days before the expiration of the initial
offering period, and we will file that press release with the SEC. You will not
have the right to withdraw any Pontotoc shares that you tender in the subsequent
offering period.

Exchange of Shares; Delivery of Cash and Our Series B Preferred Stock

        Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the offer, including, if the offer is extended or amended, the
terms and conditions of the extension or amendment, we will accept for exchange,
and will exchange, Pontotoc shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
as promptly as practicable after the expiration date and promptly after they are
tendered during any subsequent offering period. In addition, subject to
applicable rules of the SEC, we expressly reserve the right to delay acceptance
for exchange or the exchange of Pontotoc shares in order to comply with any
applicable law. In all cases, exchange of Pontotoc shares tendered and accepted
for exchange pursuant to the offer will be made only after timely receipt by the
exchange agent of certificates for those Pontotoc shares (or a confirmation of a
bookentry transfer of those Pontotoc shares in the exchange agent's account at
The Depository Trust Company, which we refer to as the "DTC"), a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or a manually signed facsimile
of that document and any other required documents.
For purposes of the offer, we will
be deemed to have accepted for exchange Pontotoc shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn as, if and when we notify the exchange agent of our
acceptance of the tenders of those Pontotoc shares pursuant to the offer. The
exchange agent will deliver cash and our Series B preferred stock in exchange
for Pontotoc shares pursuant to the offer as soon as practicable after receipt
of our notice. The exchange agent will act as our agent for the purpose of
receiving cash and our Series B preferred stock and transmitting our Series B
preferred stock and cash to you. You will not receive any interest on any cash
that we pay you for your Pontotoc shares, even if there is a delay in making the
exchange.

        If we do not accept any tendered
Pontotoc shares for exchange pursuant to the terms and conditions of the offer
for any reason, or if certificates are submitted for more Pontotoc shares than
are tendered, we will return certificates for the unexchanged Pontotoc shares to
the tendering stockholder or, in the case of Pontotoc shares tendered by
bookentry transfer of unexchanged Pontotoc shares into the exchange agent's
account at DTC pursuant to the procedures set forth below under the discussion
entitled "Procedure for Tendering," those Pontotoc shares will be credited to an
account maintained within DTC, as soon as practicable following expiration or
termination of the offer.

Fractional Shares of Our Series B Preferred Stock

        We will not issue certificates
representing fractional shares of our Series B preferred stock pursuant to the
offer. In lieu of fractional shares, registered holders will receive a number of
shares of our Series B preferred stock in exchange for shares of Pontotoc common
stock rounded up to the next whole number (after taking into account all shares
of Pontotoc common stock delivered by you).

Withdrawal Rights

        Your tender of Pontotoc shares
pursuant to the offer is irrevocable, except that, other than during a
subsequent offering period, Pontotoc shares tendered pursuant to the offer may
be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date, and, unless we previously
accepted them for exchange pursuant to the offer, may also be withdrawn at any
time after ____________, 2001. If we elect to provide a subsequent offering
period under Exchange Act Rule 14d11, you will not have the right to withdraw
Pontotoc shares that you tender in the subsequent offering period.

        For your withdrawal to be
effective, the exchange agent must receive from you a written, telex or
facsimile transmission notice of withdrawal at one of its addresses set forth on
the back cover of this prospectus, and your notice must include your name,
address, social security number, the certificate number(s) and the number of
Pontotoc shares to be withdrawn as well as the name of the registered holder, if
it is different from that of the person who tendered those Pontotoc shares.
A financial institution must
guarantee all signatures on the notice of withdrawal unless those Pontotoc
shares have been tendered for the account of any eligible institution. Most
banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses are able to provide
these signature guarantees for you. The financial institution must be a
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, an "eligible
institution." If Pontotoc shares have been tendered pursuant to the procedures
for bookentry tender discussed under the caption entitled "Procedure for
Tendering," any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the
account at DTC to be credited with the withdrawn Pontotoc shares and must
otherwise comply with DTC's procedures. If certificates have been delivered or
otherwise identified to the exchange agent, the name of the registered holder
and the serial numbers of the particular certificates evidencing the Pontotoc
shares withdrawn must also be furnished to the exchange agent, as stated above,
prior to the physical release of the certificates. We will decide all questions
as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of any notice of
withdrawal, in our sole discretion, and our decision shall be final and
binding.

        Neither we, the exchange agent,
the information agent nor any other person will be under any duty to give
notification of any defects or irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or
will incur any liability for failure to give any notification. Any Pontotoc
shares properly withdrawn will be deemed not to have been validly tendered for
purposes of the offer. However, you may retender withdrawn Pontotoc shares by
following one of the procedures discussed under the captions entitled "Procedure
for Tendering" or "Guaranteed Delivery" at any time prior to the expiration
date.
