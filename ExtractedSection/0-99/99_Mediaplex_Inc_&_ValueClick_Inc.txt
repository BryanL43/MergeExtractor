The following provides details about the events leading up to the merger deal between Mediaplex Inc & ValueClick Inc:
Background of the Merger  

    Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000 and continuing through June 2001, Mediaplex's executives held numerous internal discussions to outline
strategies that would enable Mediaplex to increase stockholder value in light of the then current economic conditions. One of these strategies was to increase efforts to identify possible strategic
combinations. During this period, Mediaplex's executives had discussions regarding potential business transactions with numerous parties that had either contacted Mediaplex executives or had been
identified and contacted by Mediaplex. The discussions with a few of these parties progressed to the point at which negotiations regarding a possible merger, and the terms of such a merger were
discussed. Mediaplex's board of directors met on eight occasions during this period
to review and discuss the status of discussions with ValueClick and the other parties identified by Mediaplex management.
In
connection with ValueClick's long-term strategic plans involving growth through strategic alliances, investments, acquisitions or business combinations, ValueClick's
management has been searching for strategic acquisition candidates since early 2001. As part of this process, ValueClick identified Mediaplex as a company with strategic assets that fit into
ValueClick's growth strategy. While ValueClick's management considered other potential acquisition candidates before it agreed to acquire Mediaplex, discussions with these other candidates led
ValueClick's management to conclude that a business combination with these other candidates would not be in the best interest of ValueClick and its stockholders at that time for a variety of reasons,
including the financial condition and operating performance of the other candidates, and potential challenges in integrating the other candidates with ValueClick. By contrast, ValueClick's management
determined to pursue the Mediaplex transaction because of the potential synergies between the two companies, the economic terms of the acquisition and the overlap of existing customer bases of the two
companies. 

    On
May 4, 2001, ValueClick's chief executive officer, James Zarley, and chief operating officer, Samuel Paisley, held a telephone conference with Mediaplex's chairman, Greg Raifman,
to discuss each company's corporate development program and overall business strategy. 

    On or about May 10, 2001, Messrs. Zarley and Raifman had a telephone conversation in which they further discussed the respective companies' businesses and strategy. From
May 10, 2001 through May 21, 2001, Messrs. Zarley and Raifman had periodic telephone conversations generally discussing the possibility of a strategic transaction between
ValueClick and Mediaplex. 

May 22, 2001, ValueClick executed a non-disclosure agreement with Mediaplex.

May 22, 2001, Messrs. Zarley and Paisley, and ValueClick's chief financial officer, Kurt Johnson, met with Mr. Raifman and Mediaplex's chief executive officer,
Tom Vadnais, at ValueClick's Westlake Village office. The Mediaplex representatives, who were joined by members of their management team on a telephone conference line, gave an online presentation of
their ad serving and email technology platforms and reviewed new customer acquisitions and existing major customer relationships. The Mediaplex representatives also described recent actions to
transfer its media business to Exile on Seventh and overall plans to achieve profitability. The ValueClick representatives presented ValueClick's operating and financial performance for the year 2000
and the first quarter of 2001. 

May 23, 2001, Messrs. Zarley and Paisley visited Mediaplex's co-location center in San Jose and its technology development center in Cupertino and
interviewed key managers responsible for network operations and technology development. At Mediaplex's corporate office in San Francisco, Messrs. Zarley and Paisley discussed the financial
outlook for 2001 and strategic fit of the two companies with Messrs. Raifman and Vadnais and the chief financial officer of Mediaplex. They also discussed with Mr. Raifman the general
and economic terms of a potential acquisition of Mediaplex by ValueClick. At that time, Messrs. Zarley and Paisley proposed a valuation, based primarily on a comparison of the then current
market capitalization of each company, in which Mediaplex stockholders would receive ValueClick common stock representing between 26% and 28% of ValueClick post-merger.
May 24, 2001, Messrs. Zarley and Raifman had a telephone conversation in which they discussed the valuation proposed by ValueClick in the May 23rd meeting, and began to pursue due
diligence on the companies. From May 24, 2001 through May 29, 2001, Mr. Raifman had frequent discussions with Messrs. Zarley and Paisley regarding the terms of a merger proposal during
which time ValueClick, based on further comparisons of each company's financial condition, results of operations and market capitalization over various periods, revised its original valuation to
propose that Mediaplex stockholders would receive approximately 30% of ValueClick post-merger. The final valuation reflected these factors as well as the results of ValueClick's due diligence, the
analysis prepared by Wit SoundView, discussions among ValueClick's board of directors and consideration of market information in ValueClick's industry sector.
May 29, 2001, Mr. Zarley submitted a non-binding term sheet containing the original economic terms to Mediaplex and discussed the document with
Mr. Raifman. This non-binding proposal contemplated: the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of ValueClick into Mediaplex in a tax-free reorganization, with Mediaplex stockholders receiving
freely tradeable shares of ValueClick common stock representing approximately 30% of ValueClick post-merger with the exact exchange ratio to be specified in the merger agreement; for ValueClick's
board of directors following the merger to consist of three designees of Mediaplex and six designees of ValueClick; for Mr. Zarley to be Chairman and for Mr. Raifman to be Vice-Chairman
of ValueClick's board following the merger; for Mr. Zarley to continue as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Paisley to continue as Chief Operating Officer of ValueClick and Mr. Vadnais
to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Mediaplex business reporting to Mr. Zarley. The proposal also provided for a 4% termination fee if the merger agreement was terminated under specified
circumstances and for specified limitations on Mediaplex's ability to negotiate unsolicited offers. Over the next three days, the companies' respective legal advisors and senior executives discussed
the term sheet, and both companies agreed to begin negotiating a merger agreement and to commence detailed due diligence. 

    On May 29, 2001, there was a special telephonic meeting of the Mediaplex board of directors that included a discussion of a potential strategic transaction with ValueClick and the
terms contained in ValueClick's non-binding term sheet. At this meeting, the Mediaplex board authorized Mediaplex's management to continue discussions with representatives of ValueClick regarding a
potential strategic transaction.
June 4, 2001, ValueClick and Mediaplex, together with their respective legal, financial and accounting advisors, began negotiating the revised economic terms of the merger
agreement, including the specific circumstances under which the termination fee would be payable and the exact restrictions on Mediaplex's ability to negotiate unsolicited offers, and other related
agreements. From June 5, 2001 until the execution of the merger agreement on July 1, 2001, ValueClick and Mediaplex and their respective financial, legal and accounting advisors, each
conducted business, financial and legal due diligence reviews. 

June 8, 2001, Mediaplex retained US Bancorp Piper Jaffray to render an opinion to Mediaplex regarding the fairness of the proposed merger from a financial point of view to
Mediaplex stockholders. 

June 11, 2001, ValueClick retained WitSoundView Corporation to render an opinion to ValueClick regarding the fairness of the proposed merger from a financial point of view to
ValueClick.
June 25, 2001, there was a special telephonic meeting of the Mediaplex board of directors to review the terms of the merger with ValueClick. Representatives of Mediaplex senior
management, US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Mediaplex's financial advisor, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, Mediaplex's outside legal counsel, also attended. Representatives
of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati made a presentation to the members of Mediaplex's board of directors regarding their legal duties and responsibilities in connection with considering the merger,
and discussed the principal terms of the merger agreement and related agreements. Mediaplex's chief executive officer, Mr. Vadnais, led Mediaplex's board in a discussion of ValueClick's and
Mediaplex's business and the risks and opportunities facing the companies. Mediaplex's chairman, Mr. Raifman, led the board in a discussion of previous presentations by management regarding
potential strategic transactions. At this time, management reported on the progress of discussions with other parties that had expressed interest in a transaction with Mediaplex and noted that no
other firm offers had been made and that other parties that had expressed an interest in a strategic transaction with Mediaplex either did not have a stock price that management believed to be
attractive to Mediaplex stockholders or had expressed an interest in buying only certain assets of Mediaplex rather than the entire company. After discussing with Mediaplex's management the level of
interest from other potential acquirors in pursuing further discussions, the Mediaplex board of directors concluded that no other transactions were viable at that time. Mediaplex's board of directors
then reviewed and discussed the status of the negotiations with ValueClick, the proposed exchange ratio, termination fees, the opportunity to entertain alternative proposals and termination rights.
Representatives of US Bancorp Piper Jaffray presented an overview and analysis of the financial terms of the proposed transaction and discussed, among other things, ValueClick's and Mediaplex's
financial performance. After discussion, the board authorized management to continue discussions with representatives of ValueClick with respect to calculating the exact exchange ratio to be specified
in the merger agreement.

Representatives of Brobeck made a presentation to the members of ValueClick's board of directors regarding the legal framework
surrounding the deliberations of the merger, and discussed the principal terms of the merger agreement and related agreements. Mr. Zarley led ValueClick's board in a discussion of ValueClick's
and Mediaplex's businesses and the risks and opportunities facing the companies. ValueClick's board of directors reviewed and discussed the status of the negotiations, including the terms of the

its oral opinion to ValueClick's board of directors that, as of such date, and subject to and based on the considerations referred to in its opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of
Mediaplex's common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair to ValueClick from a financial point of view. After discussion, ValueClick's board of directors approved, by a vote of seven to zero,
with one abstention, the merger agreement and related agreements and authorized its officers to execute, on ValueClick's behalf, the merger agreement and related agreements.

ValueClick's Reasons for the Merger  

    ValueClick's board of directors believed that the following potential benefits of the merger will contribute to ValueClick's success: 


ValueClick
would acquire Mediaplex's MOJO ad serving and AdWare product lines and other critical technologies; 

would have the ability to offer complementary product lines and improved product offerings; 

would benefit from Mediaplex's technical, engineering, management and sales expertise, which are in high demand and short supply;



would have the ability to integrate technological resources to develop new products with increased functionality and bring them to market faster
than either of the companies would do on its own; 

would have the ability to commit greater resources to both current and emerging product development efforts and fund the future growth of its
business; and 

would gain access to Mediaplex's customers and gain entry into a new strategic market segment. 

    ValueClick's
board of directors reviewed a number of factors in evaluating the merger, including, but not limited to, the following: 


information
concerning ValueClick's and Mediaplex's respective businesses, prospects, business plans, financial performance and condition, results of
operations, technology positions, management and competitive positions; 


the
due diligence investigation conducted by ValueClick's management and legal and accounting advisors; 

management's view of the positive results of combining the operations and businesses of ValueClick and Mediaplex;

and management of ValueClick to provide a fair and equitable basis for the merger;

shares of ValueClick common stock;

company following the merger;

defer purchasing decisions as they evaluate the likelihood of successful integration of ValueClick's and Mediaplex's products and the combined company's future strategy; 

risks associated with obtaining the necessary approvals required to complete the merger, including inability to obtain adequate stockholder approval or
conditions imposed by the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission that could harm the combined company's business; 

potential negative effect on ValueClick's stock price associated with public announcement of the proposed merger;
