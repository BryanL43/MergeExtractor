The following provides details about the events leading up to the merger deal between RoweCom Inc & Divine Inc:
Background of the Merger  

    From time to time, the board of directors and various members of the senior management of RoweCom have discussed strategic alternatives available to RoweCom,
especially in light of RoweCom's cash flow and working capital needs. 

    RoweCom
and divine have no history of commercial relationships prior to the discussions that led to their agreement to merge. The first contact between the two companies occurred on
March 12, 2001.

    On
March 12, 2001, Ron Bienvenu, president of divine's enterprise portal solutions business unit, placed a telephone call to Dr. Richard Rowe, RoweCom's chief executive
officer and chairman of the board, requesting a meeting to discuss ways in which divine and RoweCom might work together. They agreed to meet in Cambridge, Massachusetts on March 14, 2001. 

March 14, 2001, Mr. Bienvenu and Ted Collins, president of divine applications, met with Dr. Rowe at the Harvard Faculty Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Mr. Bienvenu spoke about divine's business strategy and indicated that divine had an interest in acquiring RoweCom as a part of its business strategy. Dr. Rowe indicated that RoweCom was
not seeking a buyer and that he believed there would be very little interest on the part of RoweCom's board of directors for a sale, but that divine was free to express its interest more concretely if
it wished. 

April 3, 2001, Mr. Bienvenu called Dr. Rowe and indicated that divine's chief executive officer and chairman of the board, Andrew Filipowski, would be in the
Boston area on April 20, 2001 and would like to meet with the management of RoweCom to discuss a purchase of RoweCom by divine. Dr. Rowe agreed to consider such a meeting, but made no
commitment. 

April 18, 2001, RoweCom's board of directors met. The meeting included a discussion with representatives of Chatsworth Securities, RoweCom's investment bankers, about the
status of obtaining additional equity financing or long-term loans for RoweCom to help it satisfy its need for working capital. Dr. Rowe presented divine's interest in acquiring
RoweCom. The consensus of the board was that management should meet with Mr. Filipowski and report back to the board the results of that meeting.

America operations, Rodney Smith, RoweCom's chief financial officer, Lee Gerkin and Albert Vasquez, representing Chatsworth Securities, and Philip Villers, a member of RoweCom's board of directors.
Mr. Filipowski presented to the group divine's business strategy and organization structure and indicated divine's interest in acquiring RoweCom in a stock-for-stock
merger. At the end of the meeting, Dr. Rowe indicated RoweCom would consider divine's interest and respond within a reasonable period of time.

Reasons for the Merger  

    Joint Reasons for the Merger.
  The boards of directors of divine and RoweCom independently concluded that they expect
that the proposed merger will: 


afford
to each company the complementary strengths of the two individual companies;


provide
the combined company significant potential advantages and resources; and 


enable
the combined company to address emerging strategic opportunities more quickly and effectively. 

divine and RoweCom have each identified additional reasons for the merger, as discussed below. It should be noted, however, that the potential benefits of the merger may not be fully realized, if at
all. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25.


    divine's Reasons for the Merger.
  In addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, divine believes that
RoweCom's knowledge resources and client base are compatible with divine's enterprise Web solutions business strategy. divine also believes that the combination of RoweCom's content and service
offerings and procurement technology with divine's software applications and sales and marketing infrastructure will enable the combined company to further its strategy of providing professional
services, Web-based technology, premier knowledge resources and managed applications that help global enterprises conveniently and cost-effectively manage information resources
and engage their constituencies. In addition, divine anticipates that the acquisition of RoweCom will expand divine's international presence, which can provide the combined business significant growth
opportunities. 

    RoweCom's Reasons for the Merger.
  In addition to the anticipated joint benefits described above, in reaching its
decision to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger and to recommend that the stockholders of RoweCom vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the merger, the RoweCom board of
directors considered a wide variety of information and factors, including the following: 


the
belief that divine's combination of professional services, Web-based technology and managed applications can further RoweCom's strategic
vision of creating a comprehensive e-media news, information and services environment for managing knowledge resources across the enterprise that provides a strong reason for frequent
visits to RoweCom's kStore;


opportunity for RoweCom to add various new corporate clients to its current client base, representing an increase in new business end-users
without some of the costs associated with growth via sales efforts;


belief that the custom nature and quality of divine's products and services will enhance RoweCom's ability to provide its clients with improved
personalized knowledge products;


anticipation that divine and RoweCom's complementary nature, as well as the diverse nature of their geographic markets, clients and service offerings,
can improve the stability and business potential of the companies' combined businesses;


merger will increase RoweCom's sales force with the addition of divine's solutions-focused sales and marketing team;


reasonableness of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including the restrictions on solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals
pending completion of the merger, termination fees and reimbursement of expenses to be paid by divine or RoweCom in the event of the termination of the merger agreement for specified reasons; 


current and historical market valuations of RoweCom and divine;


analysis presented by Chatsworth Securities and the oral opinion of Chatsworth Securities delivered on June 6, 2001, which was subsequently
confirmed and updated in writing on July 6, 2001 and is described in "Fairness Opinion of Chatsworth Securities LLC," that, based upon and subject to the matters described therein,
the consideration is fair to RoweCom stockholders from a financial point of view;
expectation that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code;


presentations by RoweCom's management and outside legal counsel;


risks associated with RoweCom remaining a stand-alone company; and


holding
shares in a larger and financially stronger enterprise should enable RoweCom stockholders to have greater liquidity in their holdings and provide
them the opportunities to participate in the potential growth of the combined businesses. 

    In
considering the proposed merger, the RoweCom board of directors also identified and considered various risks associated with the merger, including: 


potential effect that the public announcement of the merger would have on the market price of RoweCom common stock;


fixed nature of the exchange ratio and the resulting risk that, should there be a significant increase in the market value of RoweCom's common stock or
decrease in the market value of divine's common stock, the value of the consideration to be received by RoweCom's stockholders would be decreased;


possibility that the potential benefits set forth above may not be realized;


risk that RoweCom's products and services would not be successfully integrated in accordance with the projected timetable, and the risk that other
benefits of the merger would not be achieved;


risk that RoweCom's employees, especially its key management staff, would not be successfully integrated, which could reduce the value of the
acquisition;


substantial costs of integrating the business of divine and RoweCom and the transaction expenses arising from the merger;


certain
other risks applicable to the merger and the business of the combined company as set forth under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 25; and


possibility that the merger might not be consummated, resulting in a potential adverse effect on the market price of RoweCom's common stock.
