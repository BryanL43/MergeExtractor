The following provides details about the events leading up to the merger deal between Spieker Properties Inc & Equity Office Properties Trust:
Background of the Merger

In pursuing their strategies for enhancing shareholder value,
each of Equity Office and Spieker regularly consider
opportunities for acquisitions, joint ventures and other
significant transactions.

Over the last five years, representatives of Spieker management
have investigated and evaluated a number of strategic
opportunities for the purpose of enhancing value for Spieker
stockholders. The strategic opportunities considered have
included mergers with other entities, acquisitions of other
entities and businesses, divestiture of substantial portions of
Spiekers assets and joint venture opportunities. Among
other activities, Messrs. Spieker, Foster and Vought
evaluated numerous acquisition and merger opportunities in
different markets throughout the United States and reported on
these opportunities to the Spieker board of directors as
appropriate.
This analysis of strategic opportunities continued during 1999
and early 2000. In early 1999, the chief executive officer of
another entity, referred to in this description as
company B, contacted Spieker concerning a
possible transaction between Spieker and company B
culminating in a meeting between Mr. Spieker and the chief
executive officer of company B on April 6, 1999. At
that time, Spieker and company B concluded that a
combination of their two companies was not in the best interests
of their respective stockholders.

At the regularly scheduled meeting of the Spieker board of
directors on December 8, 1999, the Spieker board of
directors again considered Spiekers strategic alternatives
to enhance stockholder value. Among other things, the board of
directors discussed and considered the general status of the
economy and of Spiekers markets and other markets in
general, the REIT industry and Spiekers stock price
performance. The Spieker board of directors also received a
report of Spieker management concerning stock repurchase
programs and REIT leveraged buyout transactions.

On March 8, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the
board of directors, the Spieker board of directors discussed
with Spieker management the three-year target plan for Spieker
and different strategic alternatives available to Spieker to
enhance stockholder value. Among other things, the board of
directors reviewed Spiekers recent growth and its
prospects for future growth and the risk to Spiekers
ability to maintain above-industry average growth rates as a
result of (1) moderating of growth in market rents in
Spiekers existing markets and (2) a lack of
geographic diversification with respect to Spiekers
portfolio. In addition, Mr. Vought and Mr. Foster led
a discussion of the Spieker board of directors and
representatives of Spieker management concerning the possibility
of a merger of Spieker with another entity, the sale of Spieker
to another entity, the sale of specific assets of Spieker,
geographic diversification
of Spieker and its properties through acquisitions of other
entities or entering into different but related lines of
business. The Spieker board of directors directed management of
Spieker to continue to evaluate strategic alternatives with the
goal of maximizing stockholder value and returns.

At the June 7, 2000 and September 6, 2000 regularly
scheduled meetings of the Spieker board of directors,
discussions with representatives of Spieker management
concerning Spiekers strategic alternatives continued. At
each meeting, the board of directors again considered the
possibility of merging with other entities, divesting portions
of Spiekers assets to refocus attention on particular
markets and assets and entering into different but related lines
of business. The board also discussed the difficulties Spieker
might face in meeting its long-term growth targets on its own
given the projected size of Spieker and the markets in which
Spieker conducts its operations.

In August 2000, Spieker entered into an agreement with
another company, referred to in this description as
company C, under which Spieker and
company C agreed to exchange confidential information for
the purposes of evaluating a business transaction between the
two companies which would result in an acquisition by Spieker of
company C. After the exchange of confidential information,
Spieker determined not to pursue a transaction with
company C.

During much of 2000, representatives of Equity Office and
representatives of Spieker collaborated on a variety of specific
projects, including a technology consortium, and other ancillary
matters. From that collaboration, Mr. Vought and
Timothy H. Callahan, the Chief Executive Officer of Equity
Office, expressed an interest in discussing whether their
respective companies might jointly pursue a range of other
opportunities.
On December 6, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting of
the Spieker board of directors, Mr. Spieker led a
discussion of strategic alternatives for Spieker, including
maintaining Spiekers independence, pursuing possible
acquisitions and pursuing possible merger transactions.
Mr. Spieker informed the board that management had
concluded, after reviewing all of the possible strategic
alternatives, that a strategic merger or business combination
could be the best alternative for maximizing stockholder value.
Mr. Spieker indicated that Spieker management had concluded
that two companies were Spiekers most attractive potential
merger candidates, one of which was Equity Office and the other
of which was company B. Mr. Spieker and
Mr. Vought then led a discussion of the board of directors
concerning the relative advantages and disadvantages of a merger
with either of the two candidates. Following further discussion,
the Spieker board of directors concluded that Spieker and its
stockholders would be well served if Spieker management
investigated potential merger opportunities and directed
management to do so and to make further reports to the board.
Following the December 6, 2000 meeting, Mr. Spieker
contacted the chief executive officer of company B and
discussed the fact that Spieker was in the process of reviewing
its strategic alternatives and inquired whether company B
would be interested in resuming their conversations from
April 1999. The chief executive officer of company B
indicated that company B would be interested in resuming
those conversations and, on December 20, 2000,
Mr. Spieker and the chief executive officer of
company B met in New York where they discussed in more
detail the possibility of a combination of their two companies.
The chief executive officer of company B indicated that
company B would be interested in pursuing the possibility
of a merger of equals with Spieker. In conjunction with the
resumed conversations between Spieker and company B, the
chief executive officer of company B suggested that he and
other officers of company B meet with Mr. Foster and
Mr. Vought.

Following the December 6, 2000 meeting, Mr. Vought
contacted Mr. Callahan of Equity Office to suggest that the
two meet to discuss their respective companies and businesses.
On December 21, 2000, Mr. Vought met with
Mr. Callahan in Chicago where they discussed the
possibility of a combination of their two businesses and whether
that would be in the best interests of their respective
shareholders. Mr. Callahan indicated that he was interested
in continuing these conversations and would give Mr. Vought
a further call following Christmas. On December 23, 2000,
Mr. Callahan contacted Mr. Vought to re-affirm that he
was interested in continuing these conversations. On
December 28, 2000, Mr. Callahan told Mr. Vought
that Equity Office was interested in pursuing a business
combination with



Spieker and suggested to Mr. Vought that their two
respective companies enter into a confidentiality agreement so
that they could appropriately share more detailed information
with each other. On January 2, 2001, Spieker and Equity
Office entered into a confidentiality agreement.

On January 5, 2001, David A. Helfand, Executive Vice
President  Business Development of Equity Office,
Richard D. Kincaid, Chief Financial Officer of Equity
Office, and Shobi S. Khan, Vice President 
Business Development Investments, of Equity Office, met with
Mr. Vought and Mr. Rothstein in San Francisco where
the representatives of the two parties exchanged information
concerning their respective businesses.

On January 9, 2001, Mr. Callahan contacted
Mr. Vought to update him on the status of Equity
Offices due diligence efforts.

On January 9, 2001, Mr. Vought met with the chief
executive officer of company B to discuss the merits of a
transaction between their two companies and the possible manner
in which a transaction might be effected. On January 10,
2001, Mr. Foster and Mr. Vought met with the chief
executive officer of company B, together with three other
officers of company B, to discuss a possible combination of
their two companies and the various issues associated with a
combination, including the combination of their different
corporate cultures and how the combined company would be
operated.
During the remaining weeks of January and the first week of
February, Mr. Callahan and Mr. Vought and
Mr. Foster continued to have various conversations
concerning the combination of their two businesses. On
January 25, 2001, Mr. Foster and Mr. Rothstein
met with Mr. Kincaid, Peter H. Adams, Senior Vice
President  Strategic Planning and Operations of
Equity Office, and Michael A. Steele, Executive Vice
President  Real Estate Operations and Chief Operating
Officer of Equity Office, in San Francisco to exchange
additional information on the structure of their respective
organizations and discussed the management and personnel of
their respective businesses.

On January 26, 2001, Spieker and company B entered
into a confidentiality agreement.

On February 7, 2001, Mr. Vought met with
Mr. Callahan, Mr. Kincaid and Mr. Helfand in
Chicago. At that meeting, the representatives of Equity Office
presented a proposal to Mr. Vought concerning a merger of
Spieker with Equity Office. On February 9, 2001,
Mr. Callahan called Mr. Vought to discuss the proposal
by Equity Office to merge with Spieker.

On February 9, 2001, at a special telephonic meeting of the
Spieker board of directors, Mr. Spieker described to the
board the proposal that Equity Office had presented to Spieker
on February 7, 2001. In addition, Spieker management
informed the board that they viewed further discussions with
company B as not likely to result in a proposal that they would
be prepared to recommend to the board and that would be in the
best interests of Spieker and its stockholders. After further
discussion of the Equity Office proposal and numerous questions
by the board of directors and after receiving the recommendation
of Spieker management that Spieker pursue a transaction with
Equity Office, the board authorized Spieker management to
negotiate a strategic combination of Spieker and Equity Office
and to engage investment bankers and other advisors to help
negotiate the terms of the transaction and to evaluate whether
any resulting transaction would be fair to and in the best
interests of the Spieker stockholders.
Following that special meeting of the Spieker board of
directors, during a series of conversations between
Mr. Vought and Mr. Callahan, negotiations continued
between representatives of Spieker and representatives of Equity
Office concerning, among other things, the value of the
consideration to be received by Spieker stockholders in any
transaction. On February 12, 2001, Mr. Zell called
Mr. Spieker to discuss Equity Offices long-term
strategy and the proposal by Equity Office to merge with
Spieker. Early in the week of February 12, 2001,
Mr. Vought asked Mr. Callahan to present to Spieker
the best and final proposal of Equity Office by Wednesday or
Thursday of that week.

At the regularly scheduled Equity Office board of trustees
meeting held on February 13, 2001, Mr. Zell and
Mr. Callahan updated the board on the discussions with Mr.
Spieker, Mr. Foster, Mr. Vought and other
representatives of Spieker regarding a possible merger of
Spieker with Equity



Office. At this meeting, various members of the board expressed
their support for a transaction if it could be accomplished
along the lines described at the meeting.

On February 15, 2001, the Spieker board of directors held a
special telephonic meeting at which Mr. Spieker informed
the board that as a result of further negotiations, Equity
Office had agreed to increase the consideration payable to the
Spieker stockholders to $58.50 per share, which also included a
larger cash component than the February 7, 2001 proposal.
Mr. Spieker explained that the balance of the merger
consideration would be paid in Equity Office common shares based
on a fixed exchange ratio that was based on the average closing
price of Equity Office common shares over the 10 preceding
trading days. After further discussion of the increased
consideration and other matters relating to the merger, the
Spieker board of directors authorized Spieker management to
negotiate a merger agreement with Equity Office on these terms,
subject to Spiekers continuing due diligence with respect
to Equity Office and subject to the boards final review
and approval of a merger agreement and its terms and conditions.
On February 16, 2001, Spieker engaged Goldman Sachs to act
as its financial advisor in connection with the proposed
transaction, and Equity Office engaged Morgan
Stanley & Co. Incorporated to act as its financial
advisor in connection with the proposed transaction. During the
weeks of February 12 and February 19, each of Spieker
and Equity Office and their respective advisors conducted due
diligence with respect to each other. On February 18, 2001,
Hogan & Hartson L.L.P., counsel to Equity Office,
provided to Spieker and its counsel a draft merger agreement. On
February 19, 2001, the parties began to negotiate the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement. Beginning on
February 20, 2001, representatives of Spieker and Equity
Office, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Sullivan & Cromwell,
counsel to Spieker, and Hogan & Hartson L.L.P. met in New
York to continue the negotiations of the merger agreement and
ancillary agreements including, among other things, voting
agreements and the tax protection arrangements described under
 Interests of Spieker Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger and the Partnership Merger
beginning on page 46.
On February 22, 2001, the Equity Office board held a
special meeting at which eleven of the thirteen Equity Office
trustees, members of management and representatives of Morgan
Stanley and Hogan & Hartson L.L.P. were present in
person or by conference telephone call. The special meeting was
held in order for the Equity Office board to consider and
formally act upon the proposed merger with Spieker. At this
meeting, Equity Offices senior management reviewed with
the board financial and business terms of the proposed
transaction, including the need for Equity Office to finance the
cash portion of the proposed merger consideration, and the
results of Equity Offices due diligence review. Equity
Offices legal counsel made a presentation to the Equity
Office board in which it explained the material terms of the
proposed merger agreement and related agreements, including
closing conditions, termination rights and provisions regarding
break-up fees and termination expenses, and briefed the board on
open items. Morgan Stanley then presented its financial analysis
of the proposed merger, and delivered to the Equity Office board
its oral opinion that, as of the date of that opinion, the
consideration to be paid by Equity Office under the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to Equity
Office.
