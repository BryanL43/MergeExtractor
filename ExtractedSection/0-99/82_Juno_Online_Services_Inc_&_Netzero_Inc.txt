The following provides details about the events leading up to the merger deal between Juno Online Services Inc & Netzero Inc:
Background of the Mergers  

    NetZero's senior management team followed developments in Juno's business since December 1999 when Juno began offering free Internet access services. Juno was
the only other public company with significant capital that was offering a free service similar to NetZero's service. In May 2000, NetZero's senior management team reached a consensus that an overture
towards Juno was appropriate based on equity market conditions, similarity of product offerings and potential synergies.
In
May 2000, Mark Goldston, NetZero's chief executive officer, telephoned Charles Ardai, Juno's president and chief executive officer, and David E. Shaw, the chairman of Juno's
board of directors, to discuss the merits of a potential combination of NetZero and Juno. Through July 2000, NetZero and Juno held several informal telephonic discussions to consider the
possibility of a business combination, but no proposals resulted from those discussions. 

August 2000, representatives of Juno and NetZero met at the offices of Goldman Sachs in New York to continue the discussions regarding a potential combination. In late
August 2000, Mr. Ardai and Richard Eaton, Juno's former chief financial officer and treasurer, met with Mr. Goldston, Jon Fetveit, NetZero's vice president, strategy and
development, Ronald Burr, NetZero's president, and Charles Hilliard, NetZero's chief financial officer. The discussions between the parties continued by telephone and in September 2000, NetZero
advised Juno that NetZero was not prepared to enter into a business combination at that time. 

    During
the fall of 2000, the parties remained in occasional contact to determine whether there might be interest in a combination. In January 2001, Toby Bryce, Juno's former
senior vice president of business development, met with Messrs. Hilliard and Fetveit in California to discuss the pending lawsuits between the parties and to discuss the possibility of a
business combination or strategic relationship between the parties. 

January 2001, NetZero launched the NetZero Professional service, which is currently called the Extended Access Pass its first pay Internet access service. In
March 2001, NetZero launched the
NetZero Platinum service, NetZero's first monthly recurring billable subscription Internet access service.

April 2001, Mr. Goldston telephoned Dr. Shaw to once again initiate discussions concerning a possible business combination. Dr. Shaw and
Mr. Goldston agreed that their respective teams would have telephone discussions during the week of April 23, 2001, to assess the possibility of a transaction. During the week of
April 23, 2001, representatives of NetZero and Juno had conversations and began to analyze the merits of combining the two companies. 

    On
May 2, 2001, Messrs. Hilliard and Fetveit met with Mr. Ardai and Harshan Bhangdia, Juno's senior vice president and chief financial officer, at Juno's offices
in New York to continue discussions. 

May 8, 2001, NetZero proposed a business combination between NetZero and Juno in the form of an all stock transaction. The proposed combination would be structured as a
merger of a subsidiary of NetZero with and into Juno, in which Juno stockholders would receive 35% of the combined company. 

    Over
the following week, NetZero and Juno discussed elements of the proposal, and the parties worked toward reaching an agreement on selected material terms. Among other terms, the
parties discussed an ownership percentage of approximately 38.5% for Juno stockholders. 

May 16, 2001, NetZero and Juno entered into a three-week exclusivity agreement. 

May 21, 2001 representatives of NetZero, Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, counsel to NetZero, Morgan Stanley, financial advisor to NetZero, Juno and Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett, special


counsel to Juno, met at the offices of Morgan Stanley in New York to discuss the proposed transaction. At this time, the parties agreed that the transaction would be structured to provide for the
establishment of a new holding company, of which both NetZero and Juno would become subsidiaries. The holding company structure was proposed to allow both the Juno and the NetZero brands and services
to continue to exist while creating a new corporate identity. Following that meeting, representatives of NetZero continued their due diligence effort and, during the evening of May 21, 2001,
Brobeck delivered a first draft of the merger agreement and related documents. 

May 24 and May 25, 2001, representatives of Juno and Simpson Thacher conducted due diligence with respect to NetZero in Westlake Village, California. 

the following days, due diligence continued and the parties negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and related documents. 

June 4, 2001, Juno's board of directors held a meeting at Simpson Thacher's offices. Negotiation of the merger agreement continued after that meeting and on June 5,
2001. 

the afternoon of June 5, 2001, NetZero's board of directors met telephonically and received presentations from NetZero's senior management team, representatives of
Morgan Stanley and representatives of Brobeck. After deliberation, NetZero's board of directors adopted resolutions with respect to the proposed transaction. See "Recommendation of NetZero's Board of
Directors."

the evening of June 5, 2001, Juno's board of directors met and received presentations from Juno's senior management, representatives of Simpson Thacher and
representatives of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. At that meeting, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown rendered its oral opinion to the Juno board of directors as to the fairness to Juno stockholders from a
financial point of view of the exchange ratio of shares of our common stock for each share of Juno common stock. After deliberation, Juno's board of directors adopted resolutions with respect to the
proposed transactions. See "Recommendation of Juno's Board of Directors." 

    Negotiation
of the merger agreement and related documents continued on June 6, 2001 and June 7, 2001. On the afternoon of June 7, 2001, Juno's board of directors held a
meeting at which representatives of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown reaffirmed its opinion as to the fairness of the exchange ratio for Juno common stock, from a financial point of view, to Juno's
stockholders, and Juno's board of directors reaffirmed its earlier approval of the proposed transaction. 

    After
the closing of the Nasdaq National Market on June 7, 2001, the parties executed and delivered the merger agreement and issued a press release announcing the proposed
transaction. 

NetZero's Reasons for the Mergers


    From time to time beginning May 2000, NetZero's management team informally updated members of NetZero's board of directors with respect to of the status
of discussions with Juno and the reasons that NetZero's management team believed the combination had the potential to deliver value to NetZero's stockholders. At a meeting on June 5, 2001,
NetZero's board of directors received presentations from members of NetZero's management team, Morgan Stanley and Brobeck. NetZero's management team highlighted its belief in the transaction as well
as some of the risks associated with the mergers, including many of the issues described under "Risk Factors." NetZero's board of directors made a business judgment concerning the potential of the
combined company and the following are the
material reasons that NetZero's board recommends that NetZero's stockholders vote, at the NetZero special meeting, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

    Accelerate Growth in Pay Internet Access Business.
  Beginning in early 2001, NetZero began supplementing its revenues by
offering pay Internet access services. Until early 2001, NetZero had no experience in the pay Internet access services business. Juno had been offering pay services since 1998 

and had acquired a great deal of expertise in managing pay services. In addition, Juno had developed a significant pay subscriber base. The proposed transaction presented NetZero's board of directors
with the opportunity to accelerate NetZero's growth and expertise in the pay Internet access business. NetZero's board of directors was aware of the costs, time and uncertainty associated with
building a similar base of pay subscribers and management experience with pay subscribers and determined that the opportunity was in NetZero's best interests.
Opportunity to Spread Telecommunications and Networking Costs over a Larger Base.
  NetZero secured favorable pricing and
protected itself against near term increases in telecommunication costs by negotiating telecommunications agreements of up to three years of duration with a number of vendors. Some of these agreements
require NetZero to purchase a fixed amount of telecommunications capacity, regardless of whether that capacity is used by subscribers. Juno generally has short-term agreements with telecommunications
providers which do not require fixed capacity commitments and are priced at levels per unit in excess of NetZero's costs, assuming full utilization of NetZero's purchased capacity. The mergers
represent an opportunity to spread the costs of NetZero's telecommunications capacity and infrastructure over a larger number of subscribers. 

    Marketing to the Value Segment of the Internet.
  Most of the largest Internet service providers, including AOL Time
Warner, Earthlink, and The Microsoft Network, offer standard monthly pricing ranging from $19.95 to $23.90. Both Juno and NetZero had previously focused on building their businesses to be supported by
advertising revenues. NetZero believes that, because of this focus, both its and Juno's infrastructure have a much lower cost basis than the typical Internet service provider. In addition, the offer
of free Internet access services has proven to be an effective consumer offering, and Juno has demonstrated that many free users can be converted to pay users at a $9.95 value price point. NetZero
believes there are a significant number of consumers interested in value priced Internet access as an alternative to the standard industry pricing. NetZero's board of directors determined that the
combined company could more efficiently offer these services while containing marketing and operating costs than either party could do on a stand-alone basis.
Attractive Consolidated Advertising Base.
  NetZero believes that the Internet access market will continue to be
attractive to advertisers. Our ability to deliver a large subscriber base of users, based on NetZero's and Juno's active subscriber counts in March 2001, will potentially be more attractive to
online advertisers than what NetZero or Juno would be able to deliver as stand-alone companies. 

    Potential Cost Savings.
  NetZero believes that our cost base will be lower than the sum of NetZero's and Juno's cost
bases as stand-alone entities. NetZero's management believes reductions in telecommunication expenses, headcount, elimination of duplicate purchasing of services, reduction of marketing expenses,
consolidation of facilities and other cost reductions may be achieved by us. NetZero's board of directors also recognized that there would be near term costs associated with implementing these
reductions. 

    Confidence in NetZero's Management Team.
  NetZero's board of directors was aware of the risks associated with the
mergers, including those set forth under "Risk Factors." NetZero's board of directors also considered the challenges of integrating the two organizations. NetZero's board of directors believes that
NetZero's management team will be successful in realizing the synergies referred to in Morgan Stanley's presentation. 

    Morgan Stanley's Opinion.
  NetZero's board of directors received a presentation from representatives of Morgan Stanley
on June 5, 2001. NetZero's board of directors considered that presentation as well as Morgan Stanley's opinion as of that date, and subject to the assumptions and considerations in its opinion,
that the ratio of the exchange ratio for shares of Juno common stock to the exchange ratio for shares of NetZero common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair to 

the holders of shares of NetZero common stock from a financial point of view. Please read Annex B carefully in its entirety and see "Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated."

    Due Diligence Review of Juno.
  NetZero's board of directors received presentations from NetZero's management on
June 5, 2001 concerning the results of NetZero's investigation of Juno's business, finances and legal affairs. NetZero's board considered the results of that investigation and risks identified
by members of NetZero's management team. 

    Terms of the Merger Agreement and Related Transactions.
  On June 5, 2001, NetZero's board of directors received a
presentation from representatives of Brobeck concerning the terms of the merger agreement, the negotiations with Juno and legal issues related to the proposed transaction. Members of NetZero's
management also informed the NetZero board of directors about the terms of the agreements with related parties of Juno and the severance and retention bonus provisions proposed for Juno's directors,
officers and employees. For more information, see "Interests of Juno Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers." 

    Indications of Support.
  NetZero's board of directors noted that NetZero's senior management team supported the proposed
combination. NetZero's board of directors also noted that holders of 40.5% of
NetZero's outstanding shares of common stock were willing to enter into agreements to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement.

    Specific Negative Factors Considered.
  NetZero's board of directors considered many potentially negative aspects of the
proposed transactions. Several of these aspects were identified in NetZero's management's presentation, including, uncertainties concerning integration of the businesses, the potential loss of
subscribers, the effect of the Federal Trade Commission proposed order with respect to Juno, the potential termination of Juno's outsourced services agreements and others. Each of these risks is
highlighted in the "Risk Factors" section of this document. Morgan Stanley's presentation was based, in part, on management's financial model which may contain optimistic assumptions. Representatives
of Brobeck highlighted costs associated with the mergers, risks identified in connection with Juno's representations and warranties in the merger agreement and the inadequacy of the compensation to
NetZero if Juno terminated the merger agreement because it received a superior proposal. Among the costs identified were severance payments to Juno's officers and Juno's existing arrangements with
affiliates of Dr. Shaw. Among the risks identified were litigation against Juno, the rights of third party vendors to cancel contracts with Juno without penalty and the number of Juno employees
with "out of the money" stock options.

    General Industry Risks.
  NetZero's board of directors is knowledgeable and familiar with NetZero's industry.
Accordingly, they were also aware of many of the risks highlighted in "Risk Factors."

    This
list is not exhaustive but includes the material factors considered by NetZero's board of directors. Individual members of NetZero's board may have considered other factors not
included in this list. NetZero's board of directors did not attempt to assign relative weight to these factors but rather made the decision to approve the merger agreement after considering the
totality of the available information. 

Recommendation of NetZero's Board Of Directors  

    After careful consideration, the NetZero board of directors, on June 5, 2001, unanimously determined that the terms of the merger agreement and the
mergers are fair to, and in the best interest of, NetZero and its stockholders and approved the merger agreement and the mergers. In reaching its decision, the NetZero board of directors consulted
with its management team and advisors and independently considered the proposed merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. 
The NetZero board of
directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of NetZero vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement.

    In considering the recommendation of the NetZero board of directors with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware, however, that directors and executive officers of
NetZero may have interests in the mergers that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of NetZero stockholders. Please see "Interests of NetZero Directors and Executive Officers in
the Mergers." 

Juno's Reasons for the Mergers

    At multiple meetings in June 2001, Juno's board of directors received presentations from members of Juno's management team, Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown Inc., and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett highlighting the potential benefits of the transaction as well as some of the risks associated with the mergers, including many of the issues
described under "Risk Factors." 
The following are material reasons that Juno's board approved the mergers and that it recommends that you vote FOR the adoption of the merger
agreement.

    Significantly Greater Cash Resources.
  As of March 31, 2001, NetZero had cash, cash equivalents short term
investments and restricted cash of $163.0 million and unencumbered cash (defined as cash and cash equivalents in excess of payables and indebtedness) estimated at $125 million. At the
same date, Juno had cash and cash equivalents of $46.8 million and unencumbered cash of approximately $20 million. A combination with NetZero would provide Juno with access to
significantly increased cash resources at a time when alternate sources of funding are either unavailable entirely or available only on unattractive terms and/or in insufficient quantity. Juno's board
believes that the mergers will reduce the risk of Juno's either exhausting its cash resources or suffering significant erosion in its subscriber base due to the expense-reduction measures necessary
for the preservation of such resources. 

    Opportunity to Enhance Billable Subscriber Base.
  Juno has been marketing billable services to its free subscriber base
since 1998. Repeated exposure to such marketing messages over time may reduce their effectiveness. NetZero's subscriber base of almost 4 million active users in March 2001 represents a
largely untapped and potentially valuable pool of subscribers to whom Juno's billable services can be marketed.
