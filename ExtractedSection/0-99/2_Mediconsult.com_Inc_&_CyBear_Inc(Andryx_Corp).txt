The following provides details about the events leading up to the merger deal between Mediconsult.com Inc & CyBear Inc(Andryx Corp):
Background of the Merger

     During the last several years, Mediconsult has held conversations with a
number of companies to evaluate possible business combinations or strategic
alliances. In the third quarter of 2000, the Mediconsult board of directors
began considering alternatives to maximize stockholder value and raise
additional capital.

     Mediconsult's advisors contacted a number of companies that they and
Mediconsult had identified as candidates for a possible business combination or
strategic alliance with Mediconsult. In the last week of August 2000, Robert A.
Jennings, the then Chairman of Mediconsult, received an indication of interest
from a third party regarding a possible strategic transaction or business
combination between the two companies.

     Beginning the first week in September 2000, Ian Sutcliffe, Chief Executive
Officer of Mediconsult, and E. Michael Ingram, Chief Financial Officer of
Mediconsult, had several telephone conversations with the senior management of
the third party who had expressed an interest in Mediconsult to explore the
possibility of a strategic transaction between the companies.

     An initial meeting with senior management of this third party was held on
Monday, September 18, 2000, to discuss potential terms for a transaction
between the two companies. Meetings between the two parties continued through
the balance of September and into October 2000.

     On October 4, 2000, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to discuss possible strategic transactions. At the meeting, Mr. Ingram
disclosed that Mediconsult had been approached by a third party about a
possible transaction between the two companies, a nondisclosure agreement had
been signed by the two companies and due diligence on the third party had
begun.

     At the October 4, 2000 board meeting, Mr. Ingram informed the board of
directors that Mediconsult and its advisors had contacted several other parties
that might be interested in participating in a transaction with Mediconsult.
After contacting the parties, Mediconsult received five responses, of which two
parties declined to engage in discussions. During October, Mediconsult's
management met with three of the parties.

     On October 9, 2000, an initial meeting was held with Timothy Nolan,
President and Chief Operating Officer of Cybear Inc., Andrx Corporation's
wholly-owned subsidiary. Attending for Mediconsult were Messrs. Sutcliffe and
Ingram. This meeting was followed by subsequent meetings in

October and November 2000, attended by additional members of the Cybear and
Mediconsult senior management teams, including complete mutual due diligence
and presentations of corporate strategies and financial plans.

     On October 24, 2000, Mediconsult engaged McFarland Dewey as its financial
advisor.

     On November 2, 2000, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to discuss the status of any possible strategic transactions. During
the meeting, Mr. Sutcliffe reported that after exploring options with a number
of potential parties, he believed that only the third party who had approached
Mediconsult in August presented a viable alternative at that time.
Mediconsult's senior management and legal advisors then presented the principal
terms of the proposed combination with the third party who had approached
Mediconsult in August to its board of directors for discussion.
In the first week of December 2000, Andrx Corporation, via Cybear Inc.,
submitted a proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of
Mediconsult in a stock-for-stock acquisition, or a tax-free exchange offer, in
exchange for Cybear tracking stock. On December 4, 2000, the Mediconsult board
of directors held a special meeting to discuss the terms of Cybear's proposal
with Mediconsult's senior management and legal and financial advisors. After
some discussion, the Mediconsult board of directors proposed several
modifications to Cybear's proposal. On December 6, 2000, a term sheet was
signed, including a 21-day exclusivity period.

     On December 8, 2000, Andrx Corporation submitted a draft merger agreement
to Mediconsult. Over the course of the next month, representatives of Andrx
Corporation and Mediconsult and their respective advisors completed their due
diligence investigations and proceeded to negotiate the terms of the final
merger agreement.

     On January 3, 2001, senior executives of both Andrx Corporation and Cybear
made a presentation to the Mediconsult board of directors regarding each of
their respective businesses and the possible benefits of combining Mediconsult
and Cybear.

     On January 4, 2001, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to discuss with its financial and legal advisors the details of the
proposed transaction with Cybear, including the consideration of 43%-45% of the
outstanding Cybear tracking stock to be received by Mediconsult's stockholders,
management and certain of Mediconsult's debtors after the merger and a brief
outline of the terms of the $2,000,000 of interim financing that Cybear agreed
to provide to fund Mediconsult's operating costs between the signing and
closing of the proposed transaction. In addition, representatives of Covington
& Burling, Mediconsult's outside legal advisors, made a presentation to the
Mediconsult board of directors regarding their legal due diligence on Cybear
and Andrx Corporation and representatives of McFarland Dewey, financial
advisors to Mediconsult, made a presentation regarding their analysis of the
financial terms of proposed transaction and discussed the results of the
negotiations with the two companies.
On January 9, 2001, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to vote on the proposed transaction with Andrx Corporation and Cybear.
At this meeting, Mr. Ingram summarized the principal terms of the merger
agreement, including the credit agreement and related loan documents. McFarland
Dewey then followed up with a brief review of the presentation they made to the
Mediconsult board of directors at the January 4, 2001 meeting and expressed its
opinion that the exchange ratio was fair to the holders of Mediconsult common
stock, from a financial point of view. Following these presentations and
discussions, the Mediconsult board of directors unanimously approved the merger
agreement. After the close of business that day, Andrx Corporation and
Mediconsult executed the merger agreement and issued a joint press release
announcing the merger on the morning of January 10, 2001.

Opinion of Mediconsult's Financial Advisor

     The board of directors of Mediconsult retained McFarland Dewey to deliver
an opinion in connection with the merger. On January 9, 2001, McFarland Dewey
delivered to the Mediconsult

board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion dated January 9, 2001, to the effect that, as of that date, and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion,
the exchange ratio was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of
Mediconsult shares.

     The full text of the definitive written McFarland Dewey opinion, dated
January 9, 2001, which sets forth the assumptions made, the procedures
followed, the matters considered and the limitations on the scope of the review
undertaken by McFarland Dewey in rendering its opinion is attached as Annex B
to this proxy statement/prospectus. Mediconsult's stockholders are urged to
read the McFarland Dewey opinion carefully and in its entirety. The summary of
the McFarland Dewey opinion set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
Mediconsult's stockholders should note that:

   o The opinion does not address the merits of the underlying decision of the
     Mediconsult board of directors to proceed with or effect the merger and
     does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder as to how such
     stockholder should vote with respect to the merger agreement.

   o McFarland Dewey was not engaged by Mediconsult to participate in or
     advise with respect to the negotiation of the terms of the merger or any
     other alternative transaction and has not done so. Without limiting the
     foregoing, although in connection with the preparation of the opinion,
     McFarland Dewey did not assist Mediconsult in soliciting indications of
     interest from third parties for the acquisition of Mediconsult, McFarland
     Dewey considered the limited market check conducted by Mediconsult's
     previous financial advisor.
o McFarland Dewey does not express an opinion as to the terms of any
     transaction related to or ancillary to the merger, financial or otherwise,
     such as the financings contemplated by Mediconsult in the form of loan(s)
     from Cybear in connection with the merger.

     The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses underlying the McFarland Dewey opinion or the presentation made
by McFarland Dewey to the Mediconsult board of directors. The preparation of a
fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various determinations
as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore,
such an opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. In arriving at its opinion, McFarland Dewey did not attribute any
particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and
factor. Accordingly, McFarland Dewey believes that its analysis must be
considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analysis, without
considering all analyses, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its opinion.
In performing its analyses, numerous assumptions were made with respect to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of McFarland
Dewey, Mediconsult, Cybear or Andrx Corporation. Any estimates contained in the
analyses performed by McFarland Dewey are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by such analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of
businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the
prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold.
Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial
uncertainty. In addition, as described above, the McFarland Dewey opinion was
among several factors taken into consideration by the Mediconsult board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger. Consequently, the
McFarland Dewey analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative

of the decision of the Mediconsult board of directors or Mediconsult's
management with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio of the merger.

     In arriving at its opinion, McFarland Dewey, among other things:

   o reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information
     relating to Mediconsult, Andrx Corporation and Cybear which McFarland
     Dewey deemed to be relevant;

   o reviewed certain confidential information, including financial forecasts
     furnished to McFarland Dewey by Mediconsult, relating to the business,
     earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of each of
     Mediconsult and Cybear;

   o conducted discussions with members of senior management and
     representatives of Mediconsult, Andrx Corporation and Cybear concerning
     the matters described in the clauses above, as well as their respective
     businesses and prospects before and after giving effect to the merger;

     o visited the facilities of both Mediconsult and Cybear;

   o reviewed the market prices and valuation multiples for Mediconsult shares
     of outstanding common stock and Cybear shares of outstanding tracking
     stock and compared them with those of certain publicly traded companies
     which McFarland Dewey deemed to be relevant;

   o reviewed the results of operations of Mediconsult and Cybear and compared
     them with those of certain publicly traded companies which McFarland Dewey
     deemed to be relevant;

   o compared the proposed financial terms of the merger with the financial
     terms of certain other transactions which McFarland Dewey deemed to be
     relevant;

   o reviewed the impact of the merger on the combined company which reflected
     the impact of purchase accounting;

     o reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated January 5, 2001; and

   o reviewed such other financial studies and analyses and took into account
     such other matters as McFarland Dewey deemed relevant, including McFarland
     Dewey's assessment of general economic, market and monetary conditions.

     In preparing its opinion, McFarland Dewey assumed and relied on the
accuracy and completeness of all information supplied or otherwise made
available to McFarland Dewey, discussed with or reviewed by McFarland Dewey, or
publicly available. McFarland Dewey did not assume any responsibility for
independently verifying such information. McFarland Dewey has not undertaken an
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities of
Mediconsult or Cybear or been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

     Additionally, McFarland Dewey assumed that:

   o Mediconsult would be unable to secure alternative financing in sufficient
     time to provide working capital to continue operations, and that if such
     financing was not obtained, Mediconsult would be unable to continue as a
     going concern in the absence of the consummation of the merger and would
     likely seek protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws;

   o based on time constraints and Mediconsult's current circumstances, the
     merger is the best available transaction or course of action practically
     available that would address Mediconsult's liquidity and other financial
     concerns;

   o the information furnished to or discussed with McFarland Dewey by
     Mediconsult or Cybear has been prepared on a reasonable basis in
     accordance with industry practice and, with respect to financial planning
     data, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgment of
     Mediconsult's or Cybear's management as to the expected future financial
     performance of Mediconsult or Cybear, and that the management of
     Mediconsult or Cybear is not aware of any information or facts that would
     make the information provided to McFarland Dewey incomplete or misleading;

   o there have been no material changes in Mediconsult's assets, financial
     condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of
     the last financial statements or information made available to McFarland
     Dewey;

   o the merger will be accounted for as a purchase under generally accepted
     accounting principles and that it will qualify as a tax-free
     reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and

   o that the final form of the merger agreement would be substantially
     similar to the last draft reviewed by McFarland Dewey.


     The McFarland Dewey opinion is necessarily based upon market, economic and
other conditions as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of
such opinion. Other than as set forth in the draft merger agreement reviewed by
McFarland Dewey, McFarland Dewey assumed that no material third party approvals
regarding Mediconsult or Cybear with respect to any contracts or otherwise will
be necessary.

     McFarland Dewey reviewed and analyzed the proposed terms of the merger,
and observed that:

     o Following the merger, Mediconsult would be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Andrx Corporation;

   o As a result of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of common
     stock of Mediconsult would be converted into the right to receive 0.1430
     shares of Cybear tracking stock, subject to the adjustment provided for in
     the merger agreement. If the maximum adjustment was made, the exchange
     ratio would be reduced to 0.1144.

     o Mediconsult had negative working capital of approximately $7,179,000 as
     of December 31, 2000;

   o Upon signing of the merger agreement, Cybear agreed to loan Mediconsult
     up to $2,000,000 with a maturity date of July 15, 2001;

   o Mediconsult's shares of common stock outstanding as of the consummation
     of the merger will increase to approximately 82,056,000 shares due to the
     conversion of existing Mediconsult liabilities to common stock; and

   o Total transaction value, based on 82,056,000 shares of outstanding
     Mediconsult common stock, was approximately $6,556,000.


     The following is a brief summary of the material analyses prepared by
McFarland Dewey in connection with the rendering of the McFarland Dewey
opinion.

     Stock Price History. To provide contextual data and comparative market
data, McFarland Dewey examined the history of the trading prices for both
