The following provides details about the events leading up to the merger deal between Mediconsult.com Inc & CyBear Inc(Andryx Corp):
Background of the Merger

     During the last several years, Mediconsult has held conversations with a
number of companies to evaluate possible business combinations or strategic
alliances. In the third quarter of 2000, the Mediconsult board of directors
began considering alternatives to maximize stockholder value and raise
additional capital.

     Mediconsult's advisors contacted a number of companies that they and
Mediconsult had identified as candidates for a possible business combination or
strategic alliance with Mediconsult. In the last week of August 2000, Robert A.
Jennings, the then Chairman of Mediconsult, received an indication of interest
from a third party regarding a possible strategic transaction or business
combination between the two companies.

     Beginning the first week in September 2000, Ian Sutcliffe, Chief Executive
Officer of Mediconsult, and E. Michael Ingram, Chief Financial Officer of
Mediconsult, had several telephone conversations with the senior management of
the third party who had expressed an interest in Mediconsult to explore the
possibility of a strategic transaction between the companies.

     An initial meeting with senior management of this third party was held on
Monday, September 18, 2000, to discuss potential terms for a transaction
between the two companies. Meetings between the two parties continued through
the balance of September and into October 2000.

     On October 4, 2000, the Mediconsult board of directors held a special
meeting to discuss possible strategic transactions. At the meeting, Mr. Ingram
disclosed that Mediconsult had been approached by a third party about a
possible transaction between the two companies, a nondisclosure agreement had
been signed by the two companies and due diligence on the third party had
begun.
Principal Provisions of the Merger Agreement (See page 78)

     The merger agreement contemplates the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Andrx Corporation with and into Mediconsult, with Mediconsult surviving the
merger. Upon the consummation of the merger, Mediconsult will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Andrx Corporation and part of Cybear. The merger
will become effective on the date and time that the certificate of merger is
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or such other date and time
specified in the certificate of merger.

     The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by Andrx
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary and Mediconsult which are customary for
agreements of this nature. The merger agreement also contains customary
covenants. Some of the covenants include:

   o Mediconsult's agreement to obtain an agreement from Robert A. Jennings, a
     director and principal stockholder of Mediconsult, and from JHC Limited,
     an entity controlled by Mr. Jennings, to vote in favor of the merger.

   o Andrx Corporation's agreement to cause Cybear Inc. to provide Mediconsult
     with up to $2,000,000 in interim financing to fund its operating
     activities until the consummation of the merger or termination of the
     merger agreement.

   o Mediconsult's agreement that it will not solicit, initiate or encourage
     or take any action which would facilitate a takeover proposal or engage in
     negotiations or disclose any nonpublic information or give access to its
     properties, books or records to any person who is considering making or
     has made a takeover proposal. Mediconsult may engage in negotiations,
     however, under certain conditions.

     The merger will be completed only if specific conditions are satisfied or
waived, including the restructuring of certain obligations and amendment of
certain agreements.

     The merger agreement can be terminated at any time before the merger is
completed. In certain circumstances, Mediconsult has agreed to pay Andrx
Corporation a termination fee of $1,000,000 and granted to Andrx Corporation a
breakup warrant to purchase up to 19.9% of Mediconsult's common stock as of the
termination date. The termination fee and the breakup warrant, along with the
nonsolicitation provisions, may discourage third parties who are interested in
acquiring a significant stake in Mediconsult, and these provisions are intended
by Andrx Corporation to increase the likelihood that the merger will be
completed.

Description of Andrx Corporation Capital Stock (See page 59)

     Andrx Corporation's capital structure consists of two classes of common
stock, Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking stock, and preferred stock. Andrx
Corporation's certificate of incorporation sets forth the details of this
capital structure and is attached as Annex C to this document. We strongly
encourage you to read the certificate of incorporation carefully in its
entirety because the certificate of incorporation governs your rights as a
holder of the Cybear tracking stock.

     The certificate of incorporation provides for the following rights and
preferences with respect to the two classes of Andrx Corporation common stock:

Voting Rights


   o On all matters as to which both classes of common stock vote together as
     a single class, each outstanding share of Andrx common stock will have one
     vote, and each outstanding share of Cybear tracking stock has a number of
     votes equal to the quotient of the average market value of a share of
     Cybear tracking stock divided by the average market value of a share of
     Andrx common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the
     tenth trading day prior to the record date for determination of the
     stockholders entitled to vote, subject to some exceptions and
     qualifications. Cybear tracking stock in no event may represent in excess
     of 25% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of Andrx
     Corporation common stock.

Sale of Cybear

   o Upon a sale or other disposition by Andrx Corporation of all or
     substantially all of the properties and assets of Cybear, Andrx
     Corporation is required to pay a dividend on the outstanding shares of
     Cybear tracking stock, redeem some or all of the outstanding shares of
     Cybear tracking stock or convert outstanding shares of Cybear tracking
     stock into shares of Andrx common stock, subject to some exceptions more
     fully described in the description of the Andrx Corporation capital stock.

Optional Conversion

   o At any time after September 8, 2001, or the occurrence of tax-related
     events, the Andrx Corporation board of directors may convert shares of
     Cybear tracking stock into Andrx common stock at a specified ratio of
     market prices.

Dividends



   o Funds available for dividends on Andrx common stock and Cybear tracking
     stock are limited to the lesser of the amount that would be legally
     available for the payment of dividends on the stock of such group if the
     group were a separate company and an amount equal to the funds legally
     available for the payment of dividends for Andrx Corporation as a whole.

   o Subject to the prior payment of dividends on outstanding shares of
     preferred stock and the limitations described above, the Andrx Corporation
     board of directors may choose to declare and pay dividends on either
     class, or both classes, of common stock, in equal or unequal amounts.

Liquidation

   o In the event of a dissolution or liquidation and winding-up of Andrx
     Corporation after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other
     liabilities of Andrx Corporation and full preferential amounts to which
     holders of preferred stock are entitled, the holders of Andrx Corporation
     common stock and Cybear tracking stock will be entitled to receive the net
     assets, if any, of Andrx Corporation remaining for distribution on a per
     share basis in proportion to the specified liquidation units per share of
     each class, as more fully described herein. The liquidation rights of
     holders of the respective classes may not bear any relationship to the
     relative market values or relative voting rights of the two classes.
