The following provides details about the events leading up to the merger deal between PictureTel Corp & Polycom Inc:
BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER    

    In the summer of 1999, Bruce Bond, then Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PictureTel, and other executive officers of PictureTel met with
Robert Hagerty, Polycom's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Kourey, Polycom's Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer and other executive
officers of Polycom in Chicago to discuss a potential business combination transaction between the two companies. However, the companies were unable to agree on terms and no transaction resulted from
these discussions. 

    In
early 2000, Mr. Hagerty met with Norman Gaut, PictureTel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in Boston to discuss Polycom's interest in purchasing PictureTel's
videoconferencing products division. However, no transaction resulted from these discussions. 

December 2000, Mr. Hagerty met with Lewis Jaffe, PictureTel's President and Chief Operating Officer, at a trade show in Anaheim, California where they discussed the
topic of a potential business combination transaction between the two companies. Following that meeting, Mr. Hagerty and Jules DeVigne, an Executive Vice President of Polycom, engaged in
several telephone conversations with Mr. Jaffe to discuss a potential business combination between the two companies.
late 2000 and early 2001, PictureTel determined, in light of its history of losses, financial condition and current market conditions, that it should consider potential strategic
initiatives to enhance shareholder value, including a merger or other business combination. In connection with these efforts, PictureTel engaged Robertson Stephens to act as its financial advisor.
During this period, approximately 25 parties, which PictureTel believed were the most likely potential purchasers of PictureTel, were contacted on behalf of PictureTel to solicit their interest in a
possible transaction with PictureTel. Of the parties contacted, only two parties, Polycom and another potential purchaser, the alternative purchaser, eventually submitted written acquisition proposals
to PictureTel. PictureTel entered into confidentiality agreements with the alternative purchaser in late January, 2001, with Polycom on March 7, 2001, and with one other entity, which did not
pursue a transaction, in early March so that each could conduct business and legal due diligence. The confidentiality agreements with each of Polycom and the alternative purchaser provided for the
confidentiality of information provided by PictureTel, as well as an agreement that neither party thereto would acquire, or make an offer to acquire, assets or property of the other or merge with the
other without the prior consent of PictureTel's board of directors for a period of time specified in the respective agreements.
late March 2001, Mr. DeVigne and Mr. Jaffe spoke by telephone to arrange a meeting to discuss Polycom's interest in purchasing PictureTel's videoconferencing
products division. On April 5, 2001,
Messrs. Hagerty, Kourey, DeVigne and William Paape, Polycom's Vice President, Finance and Strategic Investments, and representatives of Thomas Weisel Partners LLC, Polycom's financial advisor,
met in Chicago with Mr. Jaffe, Robert Kelligrew, PictureTel's General Counsel, and Dalton Edgecomb, PictureTel's Chief Financial Officer, and representatives of Robertson Stephens, PictureTel's
financial advisor, to discuss an acquisition by Polycom of PictureTel's videoconferencing products division. During the week following that meeting, Mr. Hagerty had several telephone calls with
representatives of Robertson Stephens to discuss Polycom's proposed acquisition of PictureTel's videoconferencing products division and PictureTel's interest in a potential business combination
involving the entire company. In accordance with PictureTel's instructions, representatives of Robertson Stephens informed Polycom that PictureTel had determined that selling the videoconferencing
products division while retaining the services division was not an appropriate strategic initiative for PictureTel. Following these discussions, on April 11, 2001, Polycom provided PictureTel
with a proposal on the material terms of a potential business combination involving the entire company. 

    During
March and early April of 2001, the alternative purchaser also evaluated a potential business combination with PictureTel and provided its proposal on the material terms of such
a transaction to PictureTel.

    On April 13, 2001, PictureTel's board of directors convened to discuss the proposals received from the alternative purchaser and Polycom. Robertson Stephens reviewed and
summarized for the PictureTel board the financial details of each proposal and answered various questions from the PictureTel board about each proposal. Extensive discussions by the PictureTel board
members then followed regarding the strengths and weaknesses of both proposals. Following these discussions, PictureTel's board of directors determined to pursue negotiations with the alternative
purchaser and authorized PictureTel's management to sign on behalf of PictureTel a term sheet containing an exclusivity provision, which term sheet was non-binding except with respect to
certain limited exclusivity matters, with the alternative purchaser. After this PictureTel board meeting, on April 13, 2001, PictureTel signed the term sheet with the alternative purchaser.
Among other provisions, the term sheet provided that PictureTel and its representatives could not solicit or negotiate a business combination with any other entities, except in response to an
unsolicited proposal, to the extent PictureTel was required to do so by applicable fiduciary duties, after consultation with outside counsel, and required PictureTel to notify the alternative
purchaser in such event. After signing this term sheet, in accordance with PictureTel's instructions, a representative of Robertson Stephens telephoned Mr. Hagerty to notify him that PictureTel
had entered into an exclusivity arrangement with another party and that PictureTel was required to discontinue its discussions with Polycom.
On
April 24, 2001, PictureTel received a first draft of a proposed merger agreement from the alternative purchaser's counsel. Between April 24, 2001 and May 18,
2001, PictureTel and its legal and financial advisors negotiated the terms of this proposed merger agreement with the alternative purchaser and its financial and legal advisors. These discussions
included negotiation over the form of the consideration to be offered, increases in the per share consideration, and alternative structures for a transaction. 

May 10, 2001, PictureTel and its legal and financial advisors met with the alternative purchaser and its counsel to discuss the outstanding issues on the draft alternative
purchaser's merger agreement and the then pending revised terms and structure of a proposed transaction. During these discussions, the alternative purchaser stated that it had not yet obtained
financing for its proposed transaction, but that it expected to receive a commitment letter from a financial institution by May 14, 2001. The parties discussed changing the structure of the
transaction from a merger to a cash tender offer, and different forms of consideration that might be necessary if the alternative purchaser were unable to finance the cash purchase price.
May 9 and 10, 2001, Polycom's management discussed with Thomas Weisel Partners, and on May 10, 2001 Polycom's management also discussed with Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, WSGR, legal counsel to Polycom, Polycom's continued interest in entering into a business combination transaction with PictureTel. Polycom noted that
several weeks had elapsed since PictureTel had discontinued its discussions with Polycom and that PictureTel had not yet announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with a third party
regarding a business combination transaction. After discussion with its financial and legal advisors, Polycom prepared a letter to send to PictureTel advising it of Polycom's continued interest in a
potential business combination transaction with PictureTel. 

    Late
in the afternoon on May 11, 2001, Mr. Hagerty called Mr. Gaut but was unable to reach him. He then called Mr. Jaffe to notify him that Polycom would
be sending a letter to PictureTel indicating that it was interested in an acquisition of PictureTel. The price proposed by Polycom was materially higher than the price proposed by the alternative
purchaser. Mr. Jaffe indicated to Mr. Hagerty that he could not discuss any transaction with him, hung up the phone, and then immediately called a representative of the alternative
purchaser to inform him of the call. At approximately the same time, a representative of Robertson Stephens received a call from a representative of Thomas Weisel Partners notifying him of the letter
that Polycom intended to send to PictureTel. Later that afternoon, PictureTel 

received a letter addressed to Mr. Gaut from Polycom indicating its interest in purchasing all of PictureTel's outstanding shares for cash, Polycom common stock or a combination thereof.

Sunday, May 13, 2001, an informal conference call of PictureTel's board of directors was convened during which Mr. Jaffe updated the members of PictureTel's board of
directors on the call on the status of negotiations with the alternative purchaser and on the call and letter from Polycom. Mr. Jaffe then called a representative of the alternative purchaser
to discuss further the alternative purchaser's proposed transaction in light of the terms described in the letter from Polycom. 

    PictureTel's
board of directors subsequently met in the morning on May 14, 2001 to discuss the status of the proposed transaction with the alternative purchaser and instructed
management to continue negotiations with the alternative purchaser. The PictureTel board also discussed further the Polycom
letter received on May 11, 2001. The PictureTel board noted that Polycom's proposal provided for a higher price per share than the proposed transaction with the alternative purchaser and that
Polycom's offer provided PictureTel with debt financing which could potentially be greater than the debt financing included in the proposed transaction with the alternative purchaser. After discussing
the matter with outside counsel, the PictureTel board concluded that its applicable fiduciary duties required it to negotiate with Polycom in response to Polycom's unsolicited proposal and instructed
Robertson Stephens to contact Polycom regarding its proposal.
in the afternoon on May 14, 2001, PictureTel, the alternative purchaser and their respective legal counsel again met to discuss outstanding issues on the draft merger
agreement and related documents. During the course of the discussions, the alternative purchaser informed PictureTel that it still did not have a firm commitment letter for financing the transaction.
PictureTel and the alternative purchaser continued to negotiate and new deal terms were proposed by the parties, including changes in the amount and form of the consideration and the structure of the
transaction. In addition, the parties negotiated certain changes to the debt financing proposed by the alternative purchaser, including a potential increase in the amount of debt financing that would
be available to PictureTel and a reduction of the limitations applicable to the use of such funds by PictureTel. The parties continued to meet throughout the day on May 15, 2001 in order to
discuss the remaining outstanding issues. PictureTel's board of directors participated via conference call in two special PictureTel board meetings to discuss the terms of the new proposal under
consideration. At the second meeting, the PictureTel board voted: (1) to authorize PictureTel to enter into an escrow agreement with the alternative purchaser, which provided, among other
terms, for funds to be deposited and later made available to PictureTel if PictureTel and the alternative purchaser did not enter into a definitive agreement due to the alternative purchaser's failure
to act in good faith or if the alternative purchaser did not obtain a financing commitment reasonably satisfactory to PictureTel, or returned to the alternative purchaser if PictureTel signed a term
sheet or other definitive agreement with another entity and (2) to extend the exclusivity provision, subject to the PictureTel board's fiduciary duties, of the April 13 term sheet until
May 21, 2001 at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time.
Tuesday, May 15, 2001 Polycom again expressed its interest in acquiring PictureTel and indicated that it planned to provide a more detailed term sheet outlining the terms of
a proposed transaction later that day. The term sheet provided by Polycom reflected a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares at a higher price per share than the proposed transaction with the
alternative purchaser and also included a proposal for a debt financing that would be made available to PictureTel. 

the morning of Wednesday, May 16, 2001, Mr. Jaffe met with PictureTel's legal and financial advisors to discuss Polycom's revised proposal. PictureTel's legal
counsel, Ropes & Gray, met with the alternative purchaser's legal counsel to continue to negotiate the terms of that transaction prior to PictureTel's board of directors meeting at
12:00 p.m. The PictureTel board of directors met at noon to discuss the revised Polycom proposal. At the PictureTel board meeting, the PictureTel board determined, after consultation with
Ropes & Gray, that, as a result of (1) Polycom's higher all-cash 

offer, (2) the more favorable terms of the proposed convertible debt financing by Polycom and (3) continued concerns about the alternative purchaser's ability to finance its proposed
transaction, the PictureTel board's fiduciary duties to PictureTel's stockholders required the PictureTel board to evaluate and negotiate a possible transaction with Polycom while continuing to pursue
a transaction with the alternative purchaser. Immediately after the PictureTel board meeting on May 16, 2001, Robertson Stephens, at the direction of PictureTel, and Mr. Jaffe called the
alternative purchaser's legal counsel to inform them that PictureTel had received a proposal with a higher offer from another bidder. Mr. Jaffe also informed them that PictureTel wished to
continue negotiating a definitive agreement with the alternative purchaser.
Later
on Wednesday, May 16, 2001, Mr. Jaffe, together with PictureTel's legal and financial advisors, met with Polycom and its advisors regarding its acquisition
proposal. The parties continued to negotiate the term sheets relating to Polycom's proposed acquisition and debt financing. 

Thursday, May 17, 2001, the Polycom board of directors met to review the terms of the proposed transaction. Messrs. Hagerty and Kourey reviewed the strategic
rationale for the proposed transaction. Representatives of WSGR and Thomas Weisel Partners also participated in the meeting and responded to questions by the Polycom board of directors. Also on
Thursday, May 17, 2001, Polycom and its legal, financial and accounting advisors commenced their due diligence investigation of PictureTel. This due diligence investigation continued through
the signing of the definitive merger agreement on May 24, 2001. 

Thursday, May 17, 2001, Mr. Jaffe and PictureTel's financial advisor met throughout the day with Polycom and its financial advisor to discuss the terms of the
proposed acquisition and debt financing pending the proposed transaction. PictureTel and Ropes & Gray also attempted to finalize negotiations on a definitive merger agreement with the
alternative purchaser. PictureTel held informal conference calls with various members of its board of directors throughout the day to keep them apprised of the status of discussions with Polycom and
the alternative purchaser. Polycom and PictureTel and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to negotiate the term sheets relating to Polycom's proposed acquisition and debt
financing.
the morning of Friday, May 18, 2001, the alternative purchaser notified Mr. Gaut and the alternative purchaser's legal counsel notified Ropes & Gray that the
alternative purchaser was discontinuing its discussions with PictureTel regarding the proposed business combination transaction. The board of directors of PictureTel met to discuss the status of
negotiations with the alternative purchaser, as well as its ongoing negotiations with Polycom. The PictureTel board raised various concerns regarding the need for sufficient liquidity for PictureTel
and discussed the terms of Polycom's acquisition proposal and debt financing generally. At this meeting, the PictureTel board of directors authorized PictureTel to execute an exclusivity agreement
with Polycom pursuant to which PictureTel would agree not to negotiate with other parties until after midnight on Friday, May 25, 2001. The PictureTel board agreed to reconvene on Sunday
morning, May 19, 2001, to discuss the proposed transaction further. Mr. Jaffe, with the assistance of PictureTel's legal and financial advisors, continued to negotiate the terms of the
proposed transaction with Polycom and its legal and financial advisors throughout the day. During the day, and in exchange for certain changes to other terms of the transaction, Polycom agreed to
increase the proposed purchase price, provided that it could pay the purchase price with a combination of cash and Polycom stock.
Throughout
the day on Saturday, May 19 and Sunday, May 20, 2001, PictureTel, Polycom and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to meet in person and/or
by telephone to discuss changes to the proposed terms of the acquisition and the debt financing. In particular, the parties also discussed appropriate mechanisms to retain key employees and the
conditions on which the debt financing would be available to PictureTel and the terms of its conversion into PictureTel common stock or repayment. On the morning of Sunday, May 20, PictureTel's
board of directors convened an informal 

conference call to discuss the status of the negotiations with Polycom, including proposed changes to the amount and form of the consideration to be paid in the transaction. 

    Between
Monday, May 21 and Thursday, May 24, 2001, Polycom, PictureTel and their respective legal and financial advisors continued to negotiate the definitive
documentation relating to the acquisition and debt financing. Among other matters, the parties discussed various liabilities that Polycom or its acquisition subsidiary would be assuming in connection
with its acquisition of PictureTel, such as existing severance obligations, and negotiated the effect of those assumed liabilities on the purchase price. These discussions eventually resulted in a
negotiated price per share of $3.11 in cash for the cash portion and a stock exchange ratio of 0.1177 of a share of Polycom common stock for the stock portion. Also during this period, Polycom and
PictureTel continued their business and legal due diligence investigations of each other. 

Monday, May 21, 2001, members of PictureTel's board of directors convened again by informal conference call to discuss the alternative purchaser's discontinuation of its
discussions with PictureTel and to discuss the status of the negotiations with Polycom.
