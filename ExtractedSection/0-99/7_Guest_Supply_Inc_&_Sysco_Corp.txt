The following provides details on events leading up to the merger deal:
BACKGROUND OF THE OFFER

     In early 2000, Guest Supply's management concluded that a combination of
Guest Supply with another large company in a complementary industry was likely
to result in the greatest value for Guest Supply's stockholders as compared to
leaving Guest Supply as a stand-alone company.

      Following preliminary discussions with prospective financial advisors, on
June 19, 2000, Guest Supply engaged an investment banking firm, U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray, to represent Guest Supply in identifying and evaluating potential
combinations.

      Guest Supply's management and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray then identified a
number of third parties who might have an interest in combining with Guest
Supply.

      Commencing in July 2000, representatives of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
contacted numerous third parties in an effort to ascertain, on a preliminary
basis, their level of interest in combining with Guest Supply.

      On July 6 and July 21, 2000, Daniel Donoghue, a managing director of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, telephoned John Stubblefield, Executive Vice President,
Finance and Administration, of SYSCO soliciting SYSCO's interest in pursuing a
potential transaction with Guest Supply.

      On July 27, 2000, Messrs. Stubblefield and Donoghue discussed the merits of
a combination of SYSCO and Guest Supply. Mr. Donoghue also answered preliminary
questions posed by Mr. Stubblefield concerning Guest Supply's operations and
business prospects. Mr. Donoghue then provided Mr. Stubblefield with Guest
Supply's public investor package. Messrs. Stubblefield and Donoghue engaged in
occasional preliminary discussions about a possible combination between July
2000 and September 2000.

      On September 19, 2000, SYSCO executed a confidentiality agreement in
preparation for a meeting with Guest Supply's senior management team.

     On September 21, 2000, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray hosted an introductory
meeting in Chicago between Guest Supply and SYSCO. Senior representatives from
both companies attended this meeting, including Richard Schnieders, President
and Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. Stubblefield of SYSCO, as well as Clifford
W. Stanley, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul T. Xenis, Chief
Financial Officer, of Guest Supply. Messrs. Stanley and Xenis made a slide
presentation discussing Guest Supply's business, customers, industry and
historical financial performance. After this presentation, Messrs. Stanley and
Xenis answered questions and provided a broad overview as to how a potential
combination might improve both Guest Supply's and SYSCO's future prospects.

     From June until September 2000, Guest Supply, with the assistance of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, had extensive discussions with BFMA Holding Corporation
("BFMA") based upon BFMA's then-stated intention to offer $24.00 per share for
Guest Supply's common stock. After over three months of discussions, Guest
Supply terminated negotiations based in part on concerns over BFMA's ability to
finance the transaction. In November 2000, BFMA commenced a solicitation of
proxies for the election at the 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Guest
Supply of two Class C Directors nominated by BFMA. BFMA also announced that it
was prepared to offer $21.00 per share for Guest Supply's common stock. On
January 23, 2001, following announcement of the execution of the merger
agreement, BFMA announced that it intended to withdraw its proxy solicitation.
On October 19, 2000, Mr. Stubblefield and Robert G. Culak, Vice President,
Financial Reporting & Compliance of SYSCO participated in a conference call with
Messrs. Stanley and Xenis of Guest Supply to answer due diligence questions.
SYSCO and Guest Supply also discussed the strategic and financial rationale for
a possible transaction. In response to this call, Guest Supply sent a package of
due diligence material to SYSCO answering several questions raised on the
conference call.

     On October 27, 2000, Messrs. Stubblefield and Culak of SYSCO participated
in an additional conference call with Messrs. Stanley and Xenis of Guest Supply
to discuss the due diligence package

previously sent as well as to answer additional questions. Beginning on this
date, and continuing until the merger agreement was signed, representatives of
SYSCO continued their due diligence investigation of Guest Supply, including the
exchange of information regarding the business and operations of Guest Supply.

     On November 20, 2000, Mr. Donoghue and Jonathan Leiman, also of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, telephoned Mr. Stubblefield to advise him of the BFMA
proxy solicitation. Later that day, Mr. Stubblefield telephoned Mr. Donoghue to
inform him that SYSCO intended to make an offer to acquire Guest Supply on
November 27, 2000.

     On November 21, 2000, Mr. Donoghue telephoned Mr. Stubblefield to inquire
as to whether he had any additional information requests and Mr. Stubblefield
advised Mr. Donoghue that SYSCO would make an offer for Guest Supply on November
29, 2000. On November 29, 2000, SYSCO sent a draft proposal to Guest Supply
indicating a willingness to acquire Guest Supply for $25.00 per share.

     On December 1, 2000, Mr. Donoghue telephoned Mr. Stubblefield to review the
value, timing and the structure of the transaction.

     On December 5, 2000, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray participated in a
conference call with the Guest Supply board of directors to discuss the proposed
offer.


     On December 7, 2000, SYSCO provided Guest Supply a written letter of intent
indicating its williness to acquire Guest Supply for $25.00 per share. Guest
Supply did not execute this letter.

     On December 15, 2000, the Guest Supply board of directors authorized
management to enter into an exclusivity and termination fee agreement with
SYSCO. This agreement provided for an exclusive negotiating period through
January 20, 2001 whereby Guest Supply agreed not to solicit, initiate or
encourage any alternative proposals. The agreement further provided that if
Guest Supply violated this provision, accepted an alternative proposal, and
subsequently consummated an alternative transaction, Guest Supply would be
required to pay SYSCO a termination fee of $5.5 million.

     On December 18 and 19, 2000, representatives of SYSCO and SYSCO's counsel,
Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, conducted legal due diligence at the offices of
Torys, legal counsel to Guest Supply. Legal due diligence activities continued
through the execution of the merger agreement.

     On December 26, 2000, Charles H. Cotros, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of SYSCO, visited Guest Supply's Orlando, Florida distribution
center and met briefly with Mr. Xenis.

     On January 2, 2001, Messrs. Cotros, Schnieders and Stubblefield,
accompanied by Michael C. Nichols, Vice President and General Counsel of SYSCO,
visited Guest Supply's headquarters, distribution and manufacturing facilities
in New Jersey. On January 3, 2001, Messrs. Schnieders, Stubblefield and Nichols
visited Guest Supply's facilities in Cleveland, Ohio.

     On January 2, 2001, Thomas E. Lankford, Executive Vice President, Food
Service Operations and a Director of SYSCO, and Larry J. Accardi, Executive Vice
President, Merchandising Services & Multi-Unit Sales, visited Guest Supply's
facilities in Dallas, Texas. On January 3, 2001, they visited Guest Supply's
facilities in Los Angeles, California.

     From January 2, 2001 through January 5, 2001, Mr. Culak and representatives
of Arthur Andersen conducted a review of Guest Supply's financial records at
Guest Supply headquarters in New Jersey.

     On January 15, 2001, members of senior management of SYSCO, members of
senior management of Guest Supply, including Mr. Stanley, Mr. Xenis and Thomas
M. Haythe, Guest Supply's General Counsel, and representatives of U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray participated in a telephone conference during which the SYSCO
representatives made a presentation about SYSCO's business, customers, industry,
and historical financial performance. After this presentation, the SYSCO
representatives responded to questions from the Guest Supply representatives.

     On January 16, 2001, SYSCO's board of directors met by telephone conference
call to review the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction with Guest
Supply and by unanimous vote of the board of directors authorized the officers
of SYSCO to proceed with the offer and the merger.

     On January 19, 2001, Guest Supply's board of directors met to consider the
proposed transaction and merger agreement and related agreements. At Guest
Supply's board meeting, Mr. Stanley, representatives of U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, and Mr. Haythe addressed the board about the business, financial and
legal implications, respectively, of a merger between SYSCO and Guest Supply and
the terms of the proposed agreements. During that meeting, representatives of
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray informed the board that in the opinion of U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray, as of January 22, 2001, the exchange ratio under the
proposed agreement, the offer and merger was fair, from a financial point of
view, to Guest Supply stockholders. After discussion, Guest Supply's board of
directors unanimously voted to approve the agreement and the merger and
unanimously resolved to recommend that Guest Supply stockholders accept the
offer and tender their shares in the offer. At the meeting, Guest Supply's board
of directors approved an amendment to its preferred stock purchase rights plan
in order to exempt the offer and merger from the provisions of the rights plan.

     On January 20, 2001, SYSCO and Guest Supply executed an extension of the
exclusivity agreement, extending the arrangement through January 22, 2001.

     On January 22, 2001, the executive committee of SYSCO's board of directors
held a telephonic board meeting with its legal advisors and management, and
discussed the final terms and conditions of the offer and the merger as set
forth in the merger agreement and related agreements. The executive committee
approved the merger agreement and the related transactions, including the offer
and the merger, by the unanimous vote of the directors present.

     On January 22, 2001, the parties executed the merger agreement and related
documents. Immediately thereafter, SYSCO and Guest Supply issued a press release
announcing the proposed offer and merger.

                 * See "Fluctuations in Market Price" below.

     The values of our common shares in the table above are illustrative only
and do not represent the actual amounts per Guest Supply common share that might
be realized by any Guest Supply stockholder on or after completion of the offer
or the merger. The amount any Guest Supply stockholder might realize upon sale
in the market of our common shares received in the offer or the merger will
depend upon the market price per share of our common shares at the time of sale,
which will fluctuate depending upon any number of reasons, including those
specific to us and those that influence the trading prices of equity securities
generally.
Fluctuations In Market Price.  Because the SYSCO average trading price is
an average of closing prices, it might be different from the actual market value
of a share of our common stock on the date we issue shares to the Guest Supply
stockholders. The market value of shares of SYSCO common stock issued in
exchange for each share of Guest Supply might actually be less than $26.00 on
the date we issue those shares. In addition, prior to the completion of the
offer, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued for each share of
Guest Supply common stock will change if the trading price of our common stock
changes but does not go below $22.00 or exceed $30.00.

     More Information About The Exchange Ratio.  We will notify Guest Supply
stockholders by issuing a press release announcing the exchange ratio and filing
that press release with the SEC. Guest Supply stockholders can call our
information agent, MacKenzie Partners, at any time collect at (212) 929-5500 or

toll free at (800) 322-2885 to request information about the SYSCO average
trading price, including the exchange ratio for the offer, once determined.

     Transfer Charges.  Stockholders tendering shares will not be obligated to
pay any charges or expenses of the exchange agent. Stockholders owning shares
through a broker or other nominee may be charged a fee. Guest Supply
stockholders should consult their broker or nominee to determine whether any
charges will apply.
