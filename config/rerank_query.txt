You are given a series of text passages. Your task is to identify which passage contains the actual beginning of a narrative section titled "Background of the Offer" or a similarly worded section.

This section should:
- Describe a timeline of events, meetings, or decisions leading up to a merger, acquisition, or transaction.
- Provide historical context, usually in the form of detailed paragraphs.
- Begin with a clear heading like "Background of the Offer" or "Background of the Merger" followed by narrative text.

The section should not:
- Merely cite or reference another section (e.g., “incorporated herein by reference”).
- Be a table of contents entry, summary, or legal amendment to a prior document.
- Contain only references to other sections without explanation of the events themselves.

Prioritize passages with descriptive language, dates, executive meetings, strategic discussions, and decisions. Discard passages that are legal citations or summaries.

Example of a valid beginning of a Background section:

Example of an invalid reference:

---
The information set forth in the sections of the Offer to Purchase entitled "Background of the Offer..." is incorporated herein by reference.
---

Use these criteria to rerank the most relevant passages that likely contain the **start of the actual background narrative**.
